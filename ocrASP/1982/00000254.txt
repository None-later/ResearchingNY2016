To the Senior Close;

To my acquaintences who I may never see again. thanks for a
good time.
But to my.friends, get ready for the craziest two weeks of your
life; because the next 14 days are going to be hysterical. A living
room set for Mayfest was only the beginning. But it will take a
group effort. No more studying will be tolerated. SeniOr Week is
going to excite the media. and finals cannot be allowed to in-
terfere. Beware the Thursday Canoe Trip for many strange events
may occur. After graduation West end 2 will seem like the foun-
tains because we will all be there. Around the first weekendin July
get worried about the wildest Off Campus party Spring Valley has
ever seen. CBS news will be covering the entire event. Don’t
forget your bathing suit. waterskis. and your altered conscience.
As SUNYA seniors we have 14 days left. as friends we have a
lifetime of fun yet to come.
But above all remember

argentine bomb

The BritishIBroadcasting Cor-
poration says key scientists from
Nazi Germany are helping Argen-
tina build the atomic bomb. Fur-
thermore, the BBC says. the present
West German government may
have been using Argentina as a base
for its owrt nuclear weapons ex-
periments. evading a 1954 treaty
banning such research on German
territory. The architect of the
Argentine nuclear program is said
'to be Dr. Walter Schnnrr, a leadittg
Ntui scictttist who calls Argentina
“my second t‘athcrland.“ in an in-
terview with the BBC. he revealed
tltat he was invitcti back to Ger-
many to study nuclear power in the
late l‘il'ties. The knowledge he
brought back helped the Argentines
build a plant capable of producing
higitgrade plutonium. The BBC
says the plant — still under con-
struction —— will be able to produce
tcn nttclcar bombs a year.

Year in Review

Collins. The revolving door in the
coaching office has most likely
caused the demise in the [)ane‘s
record. They did compile a 7-7-1
i'all record and are playing .500 ball

offensively by Jerry Rosen (.444
batting average in the'l‘aii). Bruce
Rowlands and Tony Moschella
(.488 average).

So there it is in one “stnail,” neat

A lot was accomplished and if
you‘d like an indication of how this
season compared to those in the
past we return to Athletic Director
Ford for a comment. "it was a
typical Albany year." And that's
the name of that tune.

A very close match was played
between Dave Ulrich of Albany and
Greg Zai‘l' of Williams. Ulrich drop—
pcd the first set 6-2. then rebounded
to a second set victory by the same
score, but lost the final set by a nar-
row 7-6 margin. Ulrich had five
match points during that deciding
set. hill just could not seem to pttt

with Utrich‘s play.

,“iz'vcn though he lost, I thought
it was the best tennis match l've
seen him (Ulrich) play all year,"
said Lewis.

Lewis noted that the first three
singles matches were very tigltt.
“They could have gone either way
by the scores." Lewis commented.
"We were unable to win the crucial
games and that proved our undo—
ing."
