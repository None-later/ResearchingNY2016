Great Rejected Diversion Ideas

published -— It only seems that way. in fact.
our team of Diversions editors has to turn
down literally thousands of ideas each week
(well, not literally, but close enough). Here's
some of the best of the worst of these ideas.
for your perusal:

1. Can you match these twelve. overslze
plastic eyeglass frames with the pre-
registratlon ladies who wear them?

2. Can you name the 3 girls in NYPIRG who
wear brassleres?

3. invent a new handshake (partially spon-
sored by the N.B.A.).

4. Name both campus groups pleased with
their ASE coverage.

5. Name each Pudz character. (Hint: Zhe
Pudz is the cartoon at the left)

issues in common. 1 simply asked for a fur-
ther explanation. At the question of
socialist values I was met with widc-cycd
angry tones. Finally 1 was told that 1 should
“get the f--k out". if all 1 could do was
argue arid not support their party.
it seems to me that if a political party is
not willing to discuss and justify their
values in a rational civil manner. and only
demands blind support, they are not suited
to be in power in this country.

One of the Best

~To the Editor:

1 would like to comment on your article
about the non-renewal of Yu-shih Chen's
contract in the Chinese Studies department.
Your author states several students bclicvc
Livhua Yu lacks tcaching ability. lam a past
student of Li-hua Yu and i believe she is a
dynamic and resourceful instructor. in 1974
1 took Modern Chinese Literature in
Translation and found myself in one of the
most exciting and provocative classes i ever
took at SUNYA. She swiftly debunked our
images of Hun Suyin and Lin Yulang as the
voices of China and gave us_ Mao Tun. Lao
Shou. Lu Hsun and 001ch instead. Perhaps

 

» another instructor could have exposed us to

‘ such writers but i doubt if anyone could
have duplicated her enthusiasm and vitality.
Shc generated new perspectives and her
keen interest in the subject matter bccnmc
contagious throughout the class.

1 find it‘surprising students were concern-
-', cd for the stability of the Chinese Studies
department when Li-hua Yu returned to
SUNYA after her dismissal by Chen. Those
students arc probably not aware that it was
' through the initial efforts of Li-hua Yu in
1972 that the few classes in Mandarin cx-
pnndcd into a full program. 11 was through
her continued efforts and those of Ling
Chung (Chen's predecessor) that the pro-
gram bccumc an interdisciplinary major in
1974 and continued in the midst of propos-
ed budget cuts in 1975-1976. As president
of the Chinese Studies Club at that time, i
remember her contributions to the “con-
solidation” and “stabilization” of the pro-
, gram. The program demanded a lot of
' work and sacrifice all its inception, Li—hua
i”! Yu was thcrc then and has continued to be.
1. At the same time. her association with the

program gave it credibility among the

.Chincse intellectual community and the

 Albany Chinese community.

    
  

' Li-hua Yu is a quality teacher who has
' also been a mentor to several of tlic
tudcnts who graduated from lhc program.
, Before the cxistuncc of an official exchange
l program with mainland China. she made
personal arrangements for some of her
students to study in i’cking. She has con-
tinued to guide many of her former
students. 1 among them. For all of these
reasons. i bcllcvc l.i-hua Yu is one of thc
bcst teachch SUNYA has had.

Money Talks

 

To the Editor:

To that “inlcingcnl” cdilorial that up-
pcarcd in the (Tuesday, May 4) ASP con-
cerning SA funding towards X—ratcd films,
are you serious? Do you think SA loses
money when one of the film groups show
an X-rutcd movic? As one who works for
Albany State Cinema 1 must tell you that
you're a bit mixed up. it is through these
showings of .‘(<rnictl movies that wc
“make” money and it is only through [11050
movies that enough income is gcncrnlcd so
that we can inch our incomc line. Our job
as a filln group is to show muvlcs that pco-
plc want to see.

The idea of not showing X-rutcd rnovics
in general is to protect impnmsionnhlc
young children from pcrhnps damaging
adultlactivitics. l-low;ol_d :u'cnyou nnywny'.’

' Tilik’iila 

 

  hit;

up the Lecture Center for "101 Dalma-
tions" or "Cinderella" i would be more
than happy to see to it that it be shown
here at SUNYA. if it weren‘t for movies
like last Week's X-ratcd film "insatiable."
our decreasing budget would be further
reduced and we wouldn't even be able to
show movies like “Sleeping Beauty’hlhat
you and maybe fiflecn other people come to
see.
if you think SA is losing money when the
film groups show an X-ratcd movie you‘re
in for a rude awakening. Why don't you
direct your wrath at all the students who
make the X-ralcd movies such a success.
And while you're at it. Jerry Falwell and
your friends from the Moral Majority
might be interested in helping you out.
Good Luck!

Defying Gravity

 

To the Editor:

Two observations with rcspcct to the
front-page headline news of the ASP (April
30. 1982).

>Thcrc is no such instilulion as "Mor-
mon College." lt' Robin Tylcr said she
“performed at Mormon Collcgc." it was
doublicssly another jokc. There are scvcml
colleges and universities rim by the Church
of Jesus Christ of Lallcrduy Saints, but
none of them has "Mormon" us port of its
name.

>Thc Virgin Mary was not :in Urban
Amcricun woman. but ill] lsrucli Peasant
woman. To give birth. Urban Wcslcrn
Woman lie on their bucks (for the come-
nicncc of the male doctors. who invented
this absurd and atrocious innovation) and
scream in pain. Peasant women are
stronger. bruvcr. and also wiscr ~— they
squat for bearing children. which facilitates
and speeds the process (it helps to have
gravity working for you, not fighting
against you).

The Democratic Way

To the Editor:

Some people view the university
military training camp where order and
discipline has to be maintained. Thch arc
“dormitory officials" for instance. who use
dubious rules and regulations to give people
orders on any occasion they deem
necessary. 1 :im amazed at such a praciicc.

i think it is highly undemocratic. i do not
pay over $1,000 for :1 room in order to gel
lcss rights than any other citizcn in this
country. A special control syslcm in addi-
tion to the official legal system is nccdlcss
too. There are universities than do pretty
well without it. if someone really
misbchnvcs him or herself. he or she can be
removed from the dorms or even brought
before court. That is simple and efficient.
The legal validity of many mics and actions
is also questionable — the university rules
arc sometimes loo vuguc. tlicy conflict with
higher rules. they 1111! not confined to
educational purposcs, cntcring onc‘s room
in onc's abscncc violates a right of privacy.
putting a hold on sornconc‘s record for uni
paying a parking tickcl is it clear abuse of
power, and so on.

The firsl step to a sound university policy
however, is to relieve lhosc persons from
their (luiics who cannot handle their
responsibilities. Or docs cvcryunc icnlly
think than crculing a little siutc within :1
stall: is normal?!

Accounting

The past semester has been one of the most important for the
ASP in the past several years.

We began the semester with a massive turnover in staff. We lost
a lot of valuable people, and gained a lot of talented but inex-
perienced people.

We learned to cope with important equipment failures, and
missed deadlines. We learned to deal with angry readers and angry
advertisers.

We understood what it is. to to put out a university newspaper.
We learned about the intolerance, the impatience, and the indif-
ference that lead people to extremes.

We learned the pain of having desires crushed.

We learned the pleasure of having the truth told as well as the
horror of having lies repeated. I

We learned the importance of accuracy and fetal-he pain of inac-
curacy. Wc learned the pressures on the media can‘sometimes be
more important than the information that the media bears.

We learned to expect lies and to lie. we learned perspective and
timing. We learned how to fail. ‘ '_

But, the most important thing we learned is how to succeed. if
nothing else, we learned how to be accountable to ourselves.

if we learned nothing else, we learned the importance of accoun-
tability.
