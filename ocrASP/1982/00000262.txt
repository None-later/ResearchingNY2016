’ There’s a better way
_ to see America this summer.

Now that school’s out, take some time out to see America. i
And a great way to see it is on Greyhound with Ameripass‘n'.

The Greyhound Ameanass is your passport to unlimited

the freedom of over 100,000 miles of Greyhound routes coast to
coast. And you can get an Ameripass for 7, 15, or 30 days.

If you’re going straight home, don’t forget about '

chances are Greyhound’s going there.

So this summer, leave your car at home and go Greyhound

Albany rocked the house with a vic.
tory. vThe rematch was won by
Potsdam. but it proved to be a
meaningless game as Albany was
ranked ﬁrst at the SUNYAC Cham-
pionships by,a cointoss. thn the
Danes travelled to Buffalo to com-
pctc in the SUNYAC's it bcamc
clear to all involved that this was it
'rcboilding year. First they look on
Buffalo and the result was not
good, a Buffalo victory: Tlicn, lit
the consolation galuc. it was the
Danes who had to bc consoled, fall-
ing to Buffalo State and blowing
any chance of an at-largc bid to the
NCAA Tournament.

icdnak who tallied 532 points
and 400 rebounds in his career and
super-sub Ron Simmons, 297 points
and I85 rebounds, will be leaving
the Dane organization. The rc-
maindcr of the team will still be per
forming —— just imagine what
Saucrs will do in a ycar not set aside
for rebuilding!

This year saw the beginning of a
new varsity team. women‘s soccer.
Amy Kiddcr brought what was a
club to varsity status and the varsity
team fared pretty well. They stayed
undefeated for awhile while
finishing with an ll-6 record. This
was enough to qualify them for tile
States where the women gavc ti
respectable performance. Cathy
Russo was selected to the All-

chumpionship team and Kiddcr will

approach next ycnr in optimistic

fashion: “chI scason can only be '

bcllcr."

Tlicrc will be no ncxt scusoll for
women's lcnnis coach i’cggy Monti.
Mann, after 19 years at tllc Iiciin, in
which she incidcntly lutd no losing
seasons, is retiring to u more scdutc
Iifc. Albany's
coach had her cntirc tcum rcturning
and was optimistic.

What the licilcrs did do was placc
ninth in tho Division II State Chum—
pionships and total it 4-4 rccord in
the fall. The spring would scc
Mann’s womcn rccortl another .500
and many good—bycs ill what was
truly an illustrious cztl'ccr for the
women’s tennis couch, l’cggy
Mann. '

The men‘s tcnnis team continucd
their dominance of thc SUNYAC.

For the third straight time and fifth ’

time in eight tries, the incn‘s lL‘ttm
was crowned SUNYAC chumps.
Barry chinc, Davc Ulrich. Frcd
Gabcr. Rob Karen, Duvc Lcrncr.
and Russ Kasow all returned home
with individual championships.

Coach Bob Lewis was upprchcn- '
sivc at first, but his nctnicn rcmov- ‘

ed all of those thoughts with the
SUNYAC titlc and a 5-I l'all rccord.
Lcwis did not go the season without
his own accolades us he was namcd

many records fall and the

truly superior sprinter. Williams for
his yearly effort was named Malc
Sportsman-of—thc~Ycar at Albany.

The men’s soccer team toward
the end of the season found

Coach Bob Schicff‘lin kncw that his
team. led by All-American Afrim

State Championships, but he did
have one goal he would have liked
to achieve: a .500 record. All cvcn

kicked in a lone goal in the season's
finale, Schici‘i‘lin had his goal at

and inherited some fine talent. '

On the women's squad the code

record breaking performances can

Sue Kciliy claimed Albany's bcst
