M
Lynn Truss' near ‘miss of a
“perfect game” highlighted a
perfect three win week for the
Albany women‘s softball team.
Truss retired the first 20 out of a
possible 2! batters in the second
game of a doubleheader against
Union on Wednesday. The Albany
pitcher was one out away when
Union sandwiched a hit bctwcn two
errors to break up the no-hit bid as
‘ well as the shutout. The winner of
the game was never in doubt

however as‘ Albtmy completed a
sweep of thc twinbill. lS-i.

. “She was really pttmpcd up; the
warm weather really helped and shc
was very rcluxcd.“ said Albany

ouch Lcc Ritcnish about Truss.

I ' In the second game Rhcnish wcnt
tlo Itcr bunch and the subs respond-
qd very well. Cris Cannnta. playing
ccntcrl'icld. had three hits and three
RBI's. l’cg Squazzo. giving Lbri
Briggs a rest behind lhc plate. con-
tributcd thrcc hits and two RBI's.
Nancy Doyle also scored four runs

to pace Albany. - . v.
Nancy Wundcrlich. who Ichds‘

Alba y in virtually every offensive

catcg ry. also had three hits as well

as for RBI's. Shortstop Cathy,

Briggs slammed a solo home run.
"We played a lot of reserves and
thcyl really came through.‘ said
Rhcriish.
Tile first game was more of the
sam V as Albany blasted Union 25-l.
Truss also pitched that one and
allo cd only five hits on the way to
the victory. No lcss than five
Albziny pluycrs had at icast three
hits. Lori Briggs led the clmrgc with
four as well as scoring three runs.
Robin Gibson. Cnrol Wallace and
