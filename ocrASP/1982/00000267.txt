Bottle Bill

<Fr0nt page
Carey received over 9.000 letters in
favor of this bill.

Greenbcrg said Carey could not
sign a bill which has been in practice
in cigltt other states and has been
worth any sacrifice that has been
made.

The bill is not meant to address
all litter and pollution problems ac-
cording to Greenbcrg “But,” she
said, “instead we have tried to
simplfy the issue.

Tltc bottle bill has been designed
to provide at least six provcn
benefits to states requiring the

nickel deposit. These benefits in--

cluch

> Reduction in litter by 60 per-
cent because of the expected result .
of the incentive to collect,

> consumers would save a pro-
jected 20 percent off of current
beverage costs,

> the amount of energy ttscd to
rccycle bottles and cans would be
cut in half,

> solid waste would be reduced
at a time when landfill space is run-
ning short.

> an estimated 4.000 jobs would
be created because recyclingrequires
tnorc labor.

> it will conserve raw materials
since 75 percent less aluminum and
glass is used in recycling.

Other states which have enacted '

the required nickel deposit arc Con-
ncticut. Delaware, Massachusetts,
ltlwtl, Maine and Vctttottt.

Budget Cuts Spur Lobbying I

By Bruce Lieber
.\I.lli li‘Rll’h‘N

Lobbying efforts are still under-
way pushing for the reinstatement
of SUNY funds according to a
member of tltc SASU Cont-

tttnuicutons Department. Malt
Rciss.
“Wc'rc (SASU) concentrating

ottr efforts mainly on the Senators
and Asscntblytttcn.” said Reiss, “to
override Govcrnor‘s Cttrcy's veto"
of $12.6 million for SUNY.

in reaction to the severe bttdgct'

cuts. the Office of Financial
Management at SUNYA has sub-
mitted to SUNY Central a plan to
cope with university-wide budget
cuts without laying off any faculty
or staff. '

According to Director of Finan-
cial Management Eugene A.
Gilchrist. attrition will be the means
by which 50 vacancies. including 23
faculty vacancies. will be created.
These vacancies are in addition to
the 70 positions SUNYA presently
has open.

The creation of additonal vacan-
cies will force SUNYA to “cap
enrollment" in such,acadcmic areas
as business. computer science and

 

SUNYA Prcsidcnt Vicnet
()‘Lcury has said "We will reduce
the number of persons who can ma-
jor in business here from 1.000 two
years ago to 800 this year."
()‘l.cury has also said that services
will have to be cut. specifically in
terms of reduced operating for the
library and physical education
t'ttcniitics.

t.‘t.‘|tl of tire SUNYA work force vu-
ctllll, the campus is ovcrcnrollcd.
and 65 positionsnccd to be filled to
support the student enrollment.
While the exact amount by which
SUNYA'S allottment of funds for
salaries and wages has been reduced
in in dispute, Gilchrist claims at'tcr
negotiated raises and technical ad-
justments are taken into account. 4
SUNYA's funds for such salaries
and wages have been reduced by $1

million. 1
! L'arcy has claimed only increased 1
rcvcnuc through tax hikes could

support reinstatement of the $l2.6
million he vetoed for SUNY.
SUNYA has been budgeted $63.7

quested ol‘ Carey.

Gilchrist feels “the game isn't
over yet" as far as he is concerned
about these SUNY bttdgct cttts.
