Ilain on her wide shoulders
rain on the river's broad back
rain on the cliffs.

on the rocks, on the bridge pllin'gs.

I Thick drops In the hands of ﬂowers
nudge their hearts. 9

A lover's low sigh In space
surrounds you like space surrounds
a body by a river In constant raln.

My forearms wrap her shoulders tight,

tIl they are felt melting.

How different the river upstream
with no bridge in sight.

The stream Is so cold now

this early June to suck heat from

deep inside your muscles.

In September Its warmth Is your warmth

As she sat contemplating under the green
willow beside the river birds sang. She Im-
agined herself In front of the piano; sitting .
still. silent. To continue the spell, she slowly _, __ -_. —-
raised her arms above the piano and gently
laid them against the keys. She closed her I
eyes and the birds sang. And sang. But gent-
ly. Gently. like him: hands made of silk. lips
lucIous. moist.

Her fingers played against the black and
white rectangles as his played against her
body In the misty red twilight of the evening
before: quiet and ghostllke. Now In the .

piano. supple. but alone.

The softness between her legs appeared . v_ v
once again - yes moist. She rubbed them ‘f..“”
together - the warm sensation which started
low spread throughout her entire body. She
sighed heavily. let her head drop forward

 

 
  

and once again laid her arms against the
. keys, this time with passionate rage:
. dissonance.

It occurred to me in the pizza place
(In an oversized orange work shirt, I)
staring at the rain
working with old Italian men (one of whom
felt my bottom was a good place
for his hands until I threatened
him withvlolence - he reacted
with disgust. Tonight I pulled a
splinter out from under his fingernail
(out of his paw) we speak again-

an aesop's fable!)
with a pay phone in the corner
and Mario, who cannot leave any
woman alone (he may show me some
karate moves)
with macho Sam who shines when
he boasted about his baby.
There is much discussion of the benefits
of alcohol.
Some of the men who come in look like
a regression in species.
Some of the women who come in look
badly beaten.

There is no outcry, just a general
undercurrent of pain.

There is also, In the pizza place, a

real sense of time - we stare at the clock
as If in fear It would stop and we'd be
frozen In this place.

But it moves. perhaps the most painful
thing of all, and a fine dust settles

on everything - white like the flour I

use on the pizza dough.

And tonight, as I sponged the meat cutter.
I saw the thin dust that we are all

covered with. though you couldn't see It

it adds weight to our tired bodies,

It dims our eyes, it fills our lungs.

And it occurred to me. that It was sad

and beautiful (and In “some obscure way,
funny) ' .

that no one seemed to notice.

A, New Day For SA
Mike Corso

I one of the Student Association’s (SA) main objectives this year
rs to increase communication. It is imperative to establish cohesion
not only within the Student Association but also with the external
or student body. If lines of communication are open then the foun-
dations needed to perform and be effective have been established.

We in SA are very interested in having excellent programming
by expanding HAP Day, Homecoming, Student Activities Day
and others. Moreover, we want to go out and grab the bull by its
horns —— finding out what the students really want. After all, stu-
dent money is going into SA. It is essential that student represen-
tatives in SA speak with their constituents. After all that is the only
way to receive input.

We are also interested in a great deal of campus issues such as
safety, busing, UAS, and the like. Again it is important that

} students have input concerning these matters.
Another objective of SA is to advocate student rights by being

 proactive rather than reactive. Not only with regard to on campus

it issues but also issues within the city of Albany, the State of New
York, the United States and the World. We are people first and
students second and that fact must not be forgotten.

We will guide SA in the direction chosen by the students. Feel
frcc to cxprcss your ideas and opinions because that is how we in
1 SA becomc educated.

lion.

Education or Registration

in mid-May a long time advocate of draft registration, Califor-
nia’s Senator S.l. Hayakawa, introduced an amendment which
would deny federal aid to young male college students who failed
to register for the draft.

It seems that Hayakawa’s_intentions were not to cut down on the
number of registration resisters but rather to provide retribution to
those resisters. For example, when introducing his admendment,
Hayakawa told the Senate; “Shall we allow non-registrants to pro-
vide for their educational needs, when they have nointention of
fulfilling their national obligation. The answer is clearly no.”

There are, of course, a number of important differences bet-
ween registration rcsisters in the 80’s and draft resisters in the Viet-
nam era. Most obviously, there is neither a draft or a war in 1982.

Whereas a draft rcsister in 1968 may have been motivated (in some ‘

cases) by the fear of getting his head blown off, the registration
rcsister in 1982 (in many cases) is making an ideological stand. By
standing up for his beliefs, the registration rcsister is risking a max-
imum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. (A
spokesman for the national Committee Against Registration for
the Draft (CARD) predicts prosecutions will begin in late June or
early July.)

ldcalistically, at least, college is meant to bc a place ideology is
nurtured and developed. it seems ironic that the people who value
their ideals so greatly that they are willing to risk five years in
prison may be denied a college education. This seems like
hypocrisy on the part of Hayakawa in light of the fact that he is a
known educator and former president of San Fransico State
University

Further, the people who will be denied a college education as a
result of Hayakawa’s amendment will be those who were most
dependent on federal aid —— the lower socio-economic classes. Af-
firmative action policies and federal aid programs were introduced
in an attempt to give people from lower socio—economic groups a
chance to improve their position in this country’s society if that is
what they dcsirc.Thc Hayakawa amendment seems to bc a direct
contradiction to over to years of these programs as well as a step
back in time.

Further, th‘ amendment was tacked on to thc end of a huge
defense spending bill, the Dcpartmcnt of Defense Authorization
Bill, at the last last possible moment. Also, since the amendment
was introduced in mid-May, college students did not have a chance
to mobilizc against it. All of this led to the elimination ofpublic in-
put.

However, aids to New York Representative .lcrry Soloman have
made it very clear that he plans to introduce a nearly identical
amendment in the House of Representatives. (Soloman, from
nearby Glcns Falls, has similar amendments planned which would
deny welfare and federal jobs to registration resisters.) So there
still is a chance to write letters and make phone calls before the
amendment is put before the House and eventually signed into law
by Reagan. Othcrwisc many people may go through life without a
collcgc cducation.

Until then, have a good one.
