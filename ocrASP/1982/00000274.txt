Summer; The Time For Football Preparation

By Marc Huspel

seem a long way away from now,
but for Albany State head football
coach Bob Ford and his assistants
that date is right around the cor—
ner.

On that second Saturday in
September. the Albany State Great
Dane football team will open its
I982 season with a home game
against traditional rival. the lthaca '
College Bombers. Last year. these
two adversaries met in the Danes‘
season opener, and Albany stunn-
ed lthaca. the Division ill: national
runner-up of the year before. with
a l7-7 victory.

Whatever time has in store for
September's renewal of this ﬁerce
rivalry. and for the entire season
for that matter, remains to be seen.
But with that date looming in the ,
not-so-distant future, there are
many preparations that need to be
done and are, in fact. currently be-
ing taken care of. As Ford describ-
ed, “We're doing a combination of
things."

Perhaps the most important
“thing” occupying the coach’s
focus at the moment is what Ford
called wrapping up “the loose ends
of recruiting.” For example, Ford
explained that there are recruits
who have yet to formerly choose
Albany as their college. transfers
who are still in the same process of
consideration and EOP students

 

 

whose status of admission has not
yet been determined.

Because Albany State runs solely
Division ill programs. ones that
do not of fer scholarships. coaches
are not able to lure athletes with
extravagant packages. Rather the
recruiting process here at Albany
involves a great deal of man-hour
time as Ford. for instance. sends
his coaching troops to all of New
York State's high school athletic
sections in pursuit of talented
recruits. ‘

The entire procedure begins long
before then, however. Twice each
year (once in the spring and once in
the fall), Ford writes each high
school'coach across the state. rc—
qucsting that they forward any in-
formation about possiblc can-
didates for the football program.
The next step in the process is the
actual contact with Itheathlete via

     

   

the mail. Finally. Ford's assistants
are dispersed around the state to
meet and encourage these athletes
to get interested in Albany State.
apply, and then visit the campus
itself.

Overall, Ford emphasized two
main aspects of the process that he
and his staff keep in mind when
trying to identify “the suitable
athlete." The first is to make sure
that the student has a strong
chance of gaining admission to the
university. Albany State is a
school of high academic standards
and, inevitably. some desirable
athletes can't gain admission. The
second of Ford's rules of thumb is
to identify an athlete that can play
the game of football. Sometimes a
player's ability is too easily assum-
ed. while Vhisactual talent may bt

lacking.

All in all. the recruiting process
is an integral part of a team‘s suc-
cess. “if you can recruit well. you
have a fighting chance,” Ford
said.

As for the coming season. Ford
feels that this recruiting year has so
far been a success. though he is
reluctant to release names of top
recruits until they have proven
themselves on the ﬁeld. Looking
back, however, to the middle of
the winter. Ford commented.
"When we were back in February.
I thought it (the current recruiting
seasoniwould be a disaster, but it
has been successful in terms of
quality and quantity."

While recruiting is a major con-
cern in preparation for the l982
season. other projects are under-

Albany would win with the only
question remaining: “by how
much?“ Union answered the ques-
tiort that Saturday afternoon arid
also tirade a stateirient of their own.
The artswcr was three and the state-
incnt was articulated rather cl 'trrly:
“Albany. you lose."

The Danes would accumulate a
respectable 7-3 record arid firtd a

man the wishbone attack. Also
Dane wide receiver Bolt llricn
established a trew rcceptiort iceor'd.
The defense allowed only 85 points
and Ford concluded: “The season
ended with a good taste itt rity
mouth."

It was riot a down year for Great
Dane football.

For Dick Saucrs this was supprw
ed to be the proverbial rebuilding
year. What followed. until a visit to
Buffalo. did not resemble a
rebuilding team in shape rtor fornr.
Quite frankly. Coach Sauers “did a
good job.“ He enlisted a freshman
backcourt. Dan Crotrtier and .lart
Zadoorian, and injected some ex-

perience with Mike Gatto. .lolin
Dieckclman and Joe .lednak with
the net result being an 18-10 record.

There were many highlights in the
Dane season. After stumbling

way. One of tltesc involves the
sent to prospective team members
giving a run-down of suggested
pro-season activities. These ac-
tivitics include obtaining physicals
from their local physicians confir-
ming their eligibility to participate
and weight-training and flexibility
programs to help insure that the
athletes are in good shape when
they arrive for training camp later
on in the summer.

Another item being taken care
of. as the off-season endures. is the
forwarding of play manuals to
team members. There are speciﬁc
manuals for the offensive, defen-
sive and special teams. Ford noted
that these manuals do not vary
greatly in content front year to
year. but they are often produced
in accordance with changes in
player personnel from season to
season. Ford acknowledged that
this year's biggest changes will
come in the offensive manual,
while the others will remain
relatively the same.

The season gets into gear as the
coaching staff returns August 12
for two weeks of meetings that last
daily from nine in the morning to
approximately nine at night. On
August 23. the veterans and new
players are scheduled to report for
an intense three week training
camp as they prepare for the open-
ing contest.

So. although it is the off—season.

a lot is going on behind the scenes'

in preparation for the upcoming
football campaign. While many
are bathing in the summer sun. the
Great Danes are l‘ sy getting ready

 

 

for the fall. '

The Danes then resumed their iri-

Bears. in their first tnectirig at

out in the partisan crowd and
Albany rocked the house with a vie-
tory. The rcntatclt was won by
Potsdam. bttt it proved to be a
meaningless gatne as Albany was
ranked first at the SUNYAC Charit-
pionships by a cointoss. When the
Danes travelled to Buffalo to coni-
pcte in the SUNYAC‘s it beanie
clear to all involved that this was a

Buffalo and the result was not

This year saw the beginning of a

Amy Kidder brought what was a

team fared pretty well. They stayed
undefeated for awhile while
finishing with an 11-6 record. This
was enouin to qualify them for the
States where the women gave a

There will be no next season for

Mann. after l9 years at the helm. in
which she irteideritly had no losirtg

life. Albany's veteran women's

and was optimistic.

What the ncttcrs did do was place
ninth in the Division II State Charit-
piotiships and total a 4-4 record in
the fall. Tire spring would see

On the women's squad the code

breaking records. They showed that
record breaking performances can

destroyed downs of Albany records
while the season progressed. The
swimmers finished eleventh in the
State Championships which Coach
Fernandez considered honorable.
Sire Kcilty claimed Albany's best
finish in that event. placing fourth
in the 50- yard backstroke.

The men swam to a seventh place
