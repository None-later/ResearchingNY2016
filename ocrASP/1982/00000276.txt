Speaking of “The Politics of Disar'
mament" before a crowd of approx-
imately 75 people in Page Hall.
Citizens Party executive Barry Com-
moner blasted the military policies of
the Reagan administration which he
said are "eating away at the economic
structure of the United States."

Commoner, the 1980 Citizen’s party
presidential candidate. claimed that
Reagan‘s policies are taking jobs way
from the American people because
Reagan is shilling money from social
programs to foster a military buildup.

“The Reagan administration is not
cutting the budgct—ntilitary increases
are equal to cuts in social programs,"
said the slight, grey-haired Commoner.
livery $1 billion invested in defense
creates l4,000jobs, he added. but since
the money is taken from hospitals and
schools where it creates 55,000 jobs. a
total of 41,000 jobs are lost.
“Unemployment would be 6.8 percent
(instead of over 9 percent) if not for
military expenses.” he said. '

Commoner believes a big military
budget not only “destroys economic
growth." but lowers productivity.
"The government is eating up produc—
tive capital the economy needs by put-
ting it in the military," said Com-
moner, arguing that unless military
cuts are matte the economy will remain
weak.

Since the U.Si allocates 15 percent of
its military outlays for nuclear
Weapons. Commoner fears the govern-
ment is preparing for “Jonestown on a
global scale." But Commoner doesn't
believe the nuclear freeze proposal,
narrowly defeated in Congress recent;
ly, would prevent nuclear war.

“We must destroy every nuclear
weapon on earth—that’s the only way
to be safe from nuclear war. “’5 con-
ventional warfare that generates all the
hostility: 26 million have died in wars
since WWll. We must confront the
issue.”

Commoner outlined America’s
military need as follows: for responses
against threats to its security such as
global war. protection of resources
(Middle East oil interests) and pro-
tcciton of its shores. But unlike the
Reagan administration. Commoner
doesn’t view‘thc Soviet Union as a
global threat: “The Soviet Union
didn't invade Afghanistan until Presi-
dent Carter announced deployment of
the Rapid Deployment Force (to pro-
tect U.S. interests in the Persian
Gum.”

Ultimately. the question of whether

there will be a nuclear war depends on '

whether the Soviet Union is as ag-
gressive as Reagan believes, and
whether the Soviets are out to conquer
the world. Barry Commoner thinks
not. Quoting from a Soviet booklet on
nuclear war, commoner noted that

Happy hours at WT’s. the Lampost
and even the Rat could turn into fr
ustrated times for most freshmen and
some sophomores when the state
drinking age is raised to nineteen this
December.

Forty percent of SUNYA’s
undergraduates will not legally be old
enough to purchase alcoholic drinks,
according to Campus Center Activities
Director Jim Doellcfeld. .

The state legislature passed the bill
last June 7. joining nine states that
have upped their drinking age since
I975.

Although Doellfeld predicts this
number will drop off by the time the
law goes into effect. he still estimates
that 50 percent of the on-campus
sudents students will be affected.

The new drinking age presentsa host
of roblems for student leaders and ad-
ministration officials.

“It's so confusing." laments Stu-
‘dcnt Association Vice President Ann
Marie LaPorta.

, Dean of Student Affairs Neil Brown
formed a committee this summer to
student possile future problems.

in the past, the university policy
towards alcohol was at best “lax,"’ ac-

' puzzled as

cording to LaPorta. “The university
pretty much‘ looked the other way,"
she noted. ..

if an underage student gets drunk at
the Rat. then wraps a car around a pole
is th university at fault for having serv-
ed him?

SA attorney Mark Mishlcr believed
that in this case UAS. which runds the
Rat, could be open to damages, but
declined to spectulate further.

SA President Mike Corso remains
to how the undcragcd
students will be accommodated at
school functions. “I see it being a pro-
blem, but i don't know yet was the
answer is," He said. '

Corso believed
natives will he arrived at theﬂthe ed of

‘the month LaPorta suggested possible
rebates to the affected students for ‘
. event that they have already paid for

with the mandatory student fee. Corso
dismissed the idea as unworkable.
“How can you determine how much
you can give back." he asked.

“What were‘e trying to do is pro-
gramming that doesn't center around
liquor Within the groups," LaPorta
said, mentioning ski trips. excunsions
to Montreal and Boston and contests
as potential non-alcolholic makers.

The State Office of Employment
Relations (OER) decided last summer
that there has been no contractual
violation of ex-Chinese Studies pro-
fessor Yu-Shih Chen’s teaching con-
tract following the sudden termination
of her appointment by College of
Humanities and Fine Arts Dean John
Shumaker, according to Vice President
of Academic Affairs Lewis Welch.

An OER hearing represents the third

stage a grievance cart reach in the
United University Professions four—
f stage appealing process.
Welch declined to outline the OER
V decision, only saying that. “The OER
decision did not support (Chen's)
grievance claim."

United University Professors (UUP)
' representative John Ryan refused to
specity the exact claim. but panted out
‘ that the grievance is not aimed at Presi-I
dent O'Leary or Shumaker, and claims
only that a New York State law was

O'Leary maintained he has "not in~

Last April, Chen filed a grievance
with the UUP. requesting an investiga-
tion into the possible violation of her
. contract after her dismissal.

Chen was hired in l978 as Chinese
Studies department head. She quickly
established a new undergraduate ma-
jor, and created the China-US ex-
change program. When Chen decided
to expand the program. she opened the
part time line. then occupied by Yu. to
competition.

Yu did not reapply for the job, and
the position was filled.
