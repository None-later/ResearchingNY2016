At least 7200 students are experienc-
ing delays in receiving Federal financial
aid. and may not see tltcir checks until
early October. according to Dona;
Whitlock. Director ot' Financial Aid.

The delays stem back to three month
late Federal allocations of Supplemen-
tal Educational Opportunity Grants
(SE00). Pell Grants. and Work Study
(CWSP). \vhich halted tlte flow of
millions of dollars in aid. Whitlock
said these monies hate not been cut.

defer payments and “dig deeply into
tlteir own pockets.

"There will be .t substantial number
ol' students '.\ ho will not be able to pay
rent on time. buy their books or meet
their personal needs.“ said Whitlock.
“There are always delays of some
kind. bttt nothing of this magnitude."

The Financial Aid Office has
responded by accepting estimates oi
Pell Grants to allow tuition to be
defered. Also. off~campus students
have first priority to what money is
available to help them pay rent.

Whitlocls's office has been e\p|ain-

called to inquire why students cannot

The large demand for on-campus
housing has forced the Office oi
Residential Life to temporarily house
students in Resident Assistant (RA)
bedrooms. suiteroom and lounges. ac-
cording to John Martonc. Director of
Residential Life.

Approsimately 200 freshmen and
transfer students hate been equally
dispersed into larger rooms on the lite
quads. Martone said. They \slll remain
itt increased occupance at least two
weeks.

The mercrowding is largely the
result of “bogus” sign-ups. said Assis-
tant Director ol’ Residential Life Dean
Knapton. A "bogus" sign-up occurs
when a suite signs up upperclassmen to
raise their housing priority. Typically.
the “ghost” uppcrclassmcn do not in-
tend to stay.

After two weeks. the Residence Stall
will learn where vacancies exist and
assign students to new rooms. Martonc
explained. The earliest assigned to tem-
porary housing will be the first moved.
he explained.

Only freshmen and transfers are
temporarily housed. .continuing

dent Accounts to post notices of aid
checks that have arrived. it will iden-
tify checks by program. not individual
students. he said. .
Also. a new standard student inquiry
form for questions and complaints has
reduced waiting lines in the Financial
Aid Office. According to Huth.
students pick up the form. fill it out

and return it to the office. and a reply

will then be forwarded within l0 days.
The office will also continue to answer
questions in person. -

students are gi\en housittg preference.
"We want to keep continuing students
on campus." said .\lartone. ”\\ e don't
want to discourage them."

In the past. the nttmber ol’ terti-
porarily housed students has been as
high as 350. lhis decrease is hugely a
tesult of declining freshman enroll-
ment. Mattone said.

“Presently. we ate housing .100 more
ttanstcts than last year. but freshmen
are out first priority. Any freshmen ap-
plying gets housing." he said.

Morton continued. “The designed
housing tacilities are for 6200
students; we are accomntmlating
roughly 6.400. We want to house as
many as possible. the demand is there.
If we had the facilities we cottld hottse
300-500 more easily."

Martone espects to run the housing
system by computer nest semester.
which he believes will be a big improve-
ment over the present pen-and—
paperwork.

Martonc concluded. ‘Wc want to
give students what they want to
aeheivc—academic success and avoid
hassles. Most important is how
residents feel about living here. it’s
more than a place to study."

prevention rather than detention is the idea behind the new security
system in the campus bookstore. said Manager Marge Campbell.

“Barnes and Noble isn’t interested in catching people. We want to
stop people balore they make a mistake." Campbell said. 44 people
have been caught stealing since February 1. and the company
estimates that lot every person caught stealing. nine get away.

The new security system involves magnetizing most items on the
shelves and demagnetlzing them at the cash register. Any item not
demagnetlzed at the register will sound all an alarm at the bookstore
