“checkoff system“ of fundraisittg wottld "have
real significance for |’lR(is arottttd tltc
country.“ predicts csectttivc director of New .lcr-
sy PIRCt. I-Id Lloyd.

Rutgers attorney Gregory Reilly agrees "other
schools would want to be gttided by the court's
decision“ if it goes against the cltcclsol't' system.

speculates Rutgers could have to refund as mttch
as $l.5 million to current and past students if it
leses.

"l imagittc that atltninislt'atots ottt in Wiscon-
sin or elsewhere would have to look at that."
Marshall notes. “I‘d think that would stop a lot
of PIRG organizing."

Such talk convinces Iiebman that this is part
of an orgainiled conservative assault on I’IRGs.

“We feel (the lawsuit) was more than just the
three students who sued." Licbman says.

They charged the university made contributing
to PIRG a virtual requirement for registration

"ideological." not educational.

Attgttst said the lower court failed to establish the
facts in the case before rttiing. A new trial will be
scheduled soon.

Marshall dctties any conservative plot against
I’lRGs itt general. While no admirer of the
groups. Marshall contends "the I'ttndraising
mechanism wottld be just as improper if it were
going to a conscrtativc group."

Mid-Atlantic was too small to lead a nation-
wide attack when the case was filed in I979. he
says. “If (brewer attd fttttder of fight-wing
causes) .loe (‘oors would have wanted to do it. he
probably would have hired a couple of the
brightest people arotutd and told thetn to go

I’lRUs at Iowa. San Diego State attd Rice have
folded since 1980 after losing negative checkol'f

Rutgers remains willing to collect fees for

“We feel confident we can meet the tests“ that
would prove PIRG an educational group. Licb-

Firebugs take out frustrations in flames

<8

A suspect in a recent University of Michigan
arson case told the Detroit News he set the fire
because he was “mad at the economy, mad at the

university. and mad at (university President
Harold) Shapiro."

“Two students living together in a dorm might
get mad at one another. attd one sets fire to the
other’s closet." hypothesises Weisman. "Or a
student flunking out might set fire to the depart-
ment or instructor's office he feels is
responsible."

At Illinois State. for example. a dorm dispute"

elimaxed in an arson case that injured op student
and forced 800 others out of their dorm rooms.
recalls ISU ofﬁcial Don Knapp.

Pranks are the other major motive in the cam-
pus arson outbreak.

deliberately. bttt with a prank objective.“ Kass-
inger recalls.

“For instance. a student spraying lighter fluid
around the doorway to someone else's room,
lighting the fluid. and then pounding on the door
and running away. Some people might think
that’s funny. but it‘s pretty damned serious."

At Michigan State. a student started a $50,000
fire when he "innocently" shoved a few
firecrackers under a friend's dorm door. The stu-
dent barely escaped the resultant fire by jumping
out of the window. “Two more minutes," fire
officials say now. and the student would have
died.

Burning political poswrs off dorm walls. star-
ting waste basket ﬁres. and tossing matches into

trash shoots are also common dorm pranks that

can lead to diaster, Weisman says.

Federal aid cuts force students to
migrate from expensive private schools

WASHINGTON. D.C. (CPS) The long-
expected. forced stttdent migration from expen-
sive private colleges to cheaper four-and two-
year campuses may have finally begun. two just-
releascd studies suggest. '

The primary cause of the forced march. the
studies say. are the cttts in federal students aid
programs. ‘

According to a study by the National Institute
of lttdependcnt Colleges and Universities. as
many as 200.000 stttdents have dropped out of
private colleges and universities this year. The ex-
odus of low-income and minority students is
“much tnore dramatic than we expected." and
may broaden as this year‘s cttts in federal finan-
cial aid programs exacerbate student money pro-
blems. says NllCU's executive director. Julianne
Still Thrift.

The American Association of Community and
Junior Colleges (AACJC) expects two-year col-
lege enrollment to surpass five million nation-
wide.

Tlte reasons. according to the AACJL‘. include
an influx of un- and underemploycd people
rctttrning to school anti a significant number of
stttdcnts who chose two-year colleges at least
temporarily for financial reasons.

In some states, as tnttch as tctt percent of tlte
students who ordinarily would have gone straight
frottt high school to a four-year college ltave
chosen to live at home another year. and attettd
cltcapcr local two-year campuses. the study
reports.

Such movement suggests the onset of the
massive “step ladder effect" cdttcators began
forecasting when President Reagan introdttccd
his first federal education budget in February.
I981.

Federal bttdgct cuts and rising tuition rates
would combine to knock students down the
cconotttic ladder of cdttctttion. they said. The
poorest students at private colleges would be
forced to transfer to less expensive four-year in-
stittttions. They. in tttrn. would displace the
poorest public college students) forcing tltem to
transfer to still-less-expensive two-year colleges.

And because cantpttses catt aceomodate only a
litnited number ofstudents. they fear the poorest
two-year college stttdcnts eventually will be forc-
ed ottt of college altogether.

The migration out a private campuses began as
a trickly last January. bttt has grown to a steady
flow now.

The 200.000 who ltave dropped ottt this fall are
"much larger (a group) than we tltottgltt. attd
doesn‘t even inclttdc the effects of this year's cut-
backs." says Thrift.

"Unfortunately. most of the decline was
among students in the $6000 to 524.000 income
bracket. While some of ottr upper-income
students ttre getting tnore financial aid. the
number of low-income students getting aid ac—
tually decreased by 40 percent." she adds.

"that means tttore attd more sttttlents are hav-
ittg to pick a school based on price tathct' than
academic considerations." she assets.
