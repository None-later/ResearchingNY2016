in West - Point
—3' 53.5.: asset:

The Albany State Men's Ten-
nis team opened up their' 1982
fall season. with disappointing
weekend tournament at West
Point. Although the field of
teams which included Albany,
Army, Concordia. East

Stroudsburg. Fordhnm. lona,~

St. Johns. and Upsula. offered
very strong competition. Coach
Bob Lewis was “extremely
disappointed” at Albany’s
eighth place ﬁnish. Lewis felt
that “no one played up to
capability and that his team was
definitely not tournament
ready." _

Playing first singles for The
Danes was Barry Levine. Levine
won in the first round,
defeating Tim Brickcr of E.
Stroudsburg, 2-6. 6-3. 7-6. He

~then went on to lose in the

semifinals 6—4. 7-6, to Chris
Gilroy of Concordia. Gilroy
was the eventual tournament
winner in this ﬂight.

Playing second singles was
Rob Karen who lost to Bob
Sullivan of psula, 6-2, 6-7.

6-4. dave Ulrich played third~

ﬂight and also lost in the first
round. Lawrence Eichen, who
played as a freshman and now
has returned to the team. after
not playing for a year. com-
pcted in the fourth spot. He
won his first round match by
defeating Miguel Linan of Con-
cordia, but then lost in the so:
cond round. His St. John's 0p-
ponent in that round eventually
went on to conquer his ﬂight.

Dave Lerner played in the
fifth singles spot. He defeated
Scott Monet of Iona, 6-2, 6-0.
He then lost to Neil Fern of East
Stroudsberg who also went on
to win the tourney.

Rounding out the singles
squad was freshman Dave
Grossman. He lost to Chris
Wilson of Army 7-5. 6-0.
Grossman, however victored in
the. consolation round by ﬁrst

Tournament

beating Paul Lee of Ions 8-2. in '
a Pro-set and then crashing .

Rufail Catalon of‘ East
Stroudsberg 8-3. Grossman was
the only player to win in the
consolation round.

With Fred Gaber out with a
knee injury, the Albany doubles
teams also had a dismal day.
The one. two, and three ﬂights
at Levine-Lerner. Eiehcn-
Ulrich. and Grossman-Todd
Schmidt, all lost in the ﬁrst
round of action.

Despite the nefters unim-
pressive performance. Coach
Lewis felt that with a great deal
of hard work, the Danes have a
potentially strong team.
However Lewis saidI “l was ex-
tremely dlssapoihted and have
no excuses. I am disappointed
in my players coming back to
school not ready to play. They
have let themselves and their
teammates down. They will be
working extra hardin getting
ready for season, and as coach,
I will see to that."

The coach does feel he has a
reasonably strong team 'with
potential. All his players 'are
back from last season which in-
cludes his top five singles
players. Last year's sixth top
man. Russ Casow did transfer,
but Lewis feels freshman Dave
Grossman is stronger than
Casow and will fill this void.

The teams' goals for‘ the
season includes winning the

SUNYACS, which they~haveg

won the past three, seasons.
Another priority is to improve
their ﬁnish in our own Great
Dane tournament. Albany has
never finished better than
eighth, out of a ﬁeld of eight.

The team hopes to improve
quickly, but they have their
work cut out for them. because
of the short fall season. If they
can get ready in time. Albany
State should provide tough
competition to all their op-
poncnts.
