“You could see his potential

he’d be so good so soon."

How good? “Marcus is a

imagine he’ll be the NFL rookie
of the year.“

It might take a little time. but
when the women's varsity soc-
cer team's Individual talents
mesh, a winning squad is sure to
form. “If we gel quickly we’ll
have a great team," predicted
Coach Amy Kidder. “I think
that we will get togethersoon."

At present. the individual is
indeed the Danes’ strongest
asset. Last year Cathy Russo
was named to the All Mid-
Atlantic Secon Team and to the
State’s All-Tournament Team
as a mid-fielder. This season the
sophomore has been asked to
fill In at the goal-tending posi-
tion where “she is already doing
a really phenomenal job for
us,” according to Kidder.

Anna Courtney, also
member of last year's All Mid-
Atlantic Second Team, should
prove to be an instrumental of-
fensive weapon. As a freshman
last year. her total of 12 goals
and four assists led the squad in
both categories.

Although good things were
expected of Russo and Court-

NFL players
draw closer to
a labor strike

(AP)National Football
League players will go out on
strike during the third or fourth
weekend of the season “unless
there is some dramatic develop-
ment” in negotiations, accor-
ding to the executive director of
the NFL Players Association.

Ed Garvey said Sunday - the
opening day of the 1982 regular
season - that the NFLPA’s nine-
man executive committee will
meet next Monday to set a strike
date.

There have been no negbtia-
tions since last Wednesday
when the NFL Management
Council, representing the
owners, presented a proposal
for a ﬁve-uear package that
Jack Donlan, the management
council’s executive director,
valued at $1.5 billion. The
union rejected the proposal
almost immediately.

“What I plan to do is call
Donlan tomorrow morning to-
day and suggest that he come to
the bargaining table this week
so we can get on with it."
Garvey told the New York
Times Sunday in a telephone
conversation from his
Washington home.

Donlan, when notiﬁed of
Garvey’s comments. said: “The
union setting up strike meeting.
after the owners have offered
the players over $600 million in
new money, is consistent with
management's viewpoint that
Garvey wants nothing but a
strike. He has refused to have
mediation, which is almost
unheard of, and he continues to
harbor an interest in a concept
that Is almost alien to labor
management in the United
States."

Donlan was referring to the
union's continuing demand for
55 percent of the owners’ gross
receipts.

pears to be the surprise of the
season. Even though the for-
ward was the second leading
scorer last year. it was basically
an up and down season for
Slagei. “This year she has just
come to life. She is in the right
place at the right time,” said an
enthusiastic Kidder. “This year
she's going to do it!"

If the former three cannot
always “do it.” there is plenty
of team depth to back them up.
“Every year the talent seems to
get better. I don't think there is
anyone on our bench that can
hurt out play." commented the

in the form of young recruits
and transfer students. Only
eight returned from last year's
team which had an overall
record of 11-6 and ﬁnished fifth
in the Division 111 state cham-
pionships.

Amongst the players Kidder
and new Assistant Coach
JoAnnn Smith will seek for aid
are Karen Bart: and Dec Marfe.
Bartz has always been an ex-
tremely consistent contributor
inthe past. and transfer Marfe
will hopefully be a skilled and

tough competitor for the future. 7
