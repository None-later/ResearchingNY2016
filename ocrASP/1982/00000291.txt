I always wanted to be Diane Keaton. For me. she per-
sonified the ideal woman; she was beautiful. talented.
funny and she thought nothing about sleeping with a man
that was a hell of a lot shorter than she was. After i saw
the movie Annie Hall. I dressed in vests and ties. and
trapsed around saying “la di da". l searched for a Woody
Allen look-a—like. and when i found that a difficult task. i
decided that she was better off without him anyway.
When she left him for‘Warren Beatty. I got very depress-
ed; first of all. there are no substitutes for Warren. and
until Reds I couldn’t take him seriously. Furthermore. by
the time Reds came out. i was practically over my in-
fatuation. Yeah, she was still beautiful. funny. etc.. etc.
but she just didn’t inspire me anymore. Back in those
days 1 was living on Madison Avenue with three guys
(don't ask), and they didn't find her all that fascinating.
Not that that had anything to do with my changing ideals.
mind you. i simply evolved on my own. Nevertheless. l
was intrigued by the various attractions people formed for
one another. and the motivations inherent in these
choices. Mitch was into Bowie. Kenny was into Garcia
(yes. he also played guitar). Tim was into Phil Collins.
Hence. the centerfold.

And so it goes. Beauties have passed away. desires are
hushed, hearts are slow to learn. Yes, another year has
slipped away. and here were are again. desperately
waiting. and tearing the end. The men and women who
think . . . where does it lead them? Words that are life's
blind utterance. Of absolutes. ambition. alienation. The
shifting shores still shift. the beggars still hungry and wet.
Angels still sing a song whispering fire and thought: of ab-
solutes. ambitions. alienation. and aspects.
