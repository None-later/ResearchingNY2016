OQA  newproiesslonal if
coordinator and student volunteers ' '

By. Mark'Walter

The Of f-Campus Association(0CA) is taking on ad-
ded dimensions this year‘as its new coordinator. Diane'
Podolsky, implements plans for a more comprehensive
organization.

Podolsky has a bright, service-oriented past. and
Student Associationffesldent Mike Corso described
her as "experienced" and possessed with an “enor-
mous amount of enthusiasm." Podolsky graduated
last year from SUNYA and has returned to start her
career. As coordinator of OCA. she is the only one of
the 21-person staff to be salaried.

Her ﬁrst job as coordinator was to assemble 20 com-
munity service volunteers to work in the OCA. Each of

at 9:00pm
in    these students works six hours a week on various OCA
projects. and will receive three University credits for

 theirypartlcipation.
As Podolsky said, “The OCA will provide‘a large

number of services speciﬁcally designed to make off-
eampus living easier and cheaper. “There hasn't been
that much OCA programming in the past, and l'd like
to see more." she said.

One of the principle functions of the OCA “think-
tank" is research into the laws that govern the student-
landlord relationship. Under the”anti-grouper" law.
no more than three unrelated persons may occupy the
same dwelling, and since it restricts student choice in
inexpensive housing. the OCA is involved in the study
and possible repeal of the statute.

Anather such law deals with the certificate of oc-
cupnncygthat landlords must have. Corso said. “it’s
very important that students ask their landlords

it often happens that an off-campus student lives

burdens. The OCA wil institute a coupon exchange, Community. Black parties. events in Washington park.   t  i ‘

junction with the OCA’s “survival guide" which lists

the expense of refreshments and fees.
