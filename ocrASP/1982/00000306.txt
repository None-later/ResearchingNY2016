.Socialism is not dead

We the Editor:

Anybody who thinks Socialism is a dead issue should
have been at the recent National Convention of the
Socialist Labor Party (where i had the high honor of being
a delegate) held in Milwaukee at the University of Wiscon-
sin that lasted for a week.

The Convention. among other business. adopted resolu-
tions on the threat of nuclear war and the rights of Native
Americans. Both resolutions appear in the Labor Day Issue
lot‘ the Socialist Labor Party paper. The People.

The general consensus of the delegates was that more
energy. time. and work must be done if the Socialist Labor
Party and what it stands for is to become known to‘ the
great mass of the American people. the working class.

That the friends and members of the Socialist Labor Par-
ty raised more "bread" at the Convention Banquet this
year than in 1981, shows their determination to continue
the struggle to create a better decent social order—before it
will be too late. Thank you.

To the Editor:

To this tax payer. SUNYA payer. SUNYA student and
l,SUNYA servant. it is indeed paradoxical that while the ID.-
iregulation for riding the SUNYA buses is being so inex-
;orably enforced. the same strictness is not evident about the
unning condition of the buses. Especially in light of the
,.-fact that when a bus breaks down. it could mean a delay of
‘as many as 55 minutes for the next bus to pick up students
t the Wellington. for instance. or course. there is not a
' paradox if the SUNYA buses are not a service. but an act of
«.‘i‘mercy; and therefore we can take it or leave it.

 Reagan’s Rhetoric

To the Editor:

Ronald Reagan's anti-Soviet rhetoric and his imposition
of sanctions on corporations of our Western allies con-
i tributing in the construction of the European gas pipeline is
inconsistent with his new Middle East policy. This same
A Ronald Reagan is now ready to consider placing punishing
sanctions on another ally and trusted friend because it
,. humiliated the armed forces of two of the Soviet Union's
' ' chief clients. lsracl has defeated the Syrian forces occupy-
‘ ing Lebanon. Syria is one of the most radical. dcstablizing.
 anti-American. pro-Soviet nations in the entire Middle
East. israel has effectively destroyed and uprooted the
world's leading murder organization. the PLO. These ter-
rorists were sent scurrying for cover throughout the Arab
World. their lives saved thanks to lsracli restraint and
American marines. israel has given. for the ﬁrst time in
twelve years. the hope of freedom to the only other
Western-style democracy in the region, Lebanon. israel has
cracked the Soviet air defense system; the same one in place

over Eastern Europe.
These are truly strange times; American prestige. in-
} fluence and power are at a zenith in the Middle East; a once
prosperous democracy has been given a new lease on life;

most advanced Soviet weapon systems; and a worldwide
terrorist program has been obliterated. All of this.was made
possible thanks to the sacrifice in blood of one of
America's truest friends and staunchcst allies. israel. What
thanks does israel receive’l Ronald Reagan’s Bechtel board
decides to impose an American peace plan on Israel. one
which would in the process of weakening israel also weaken
American interests in the region. . -

if it is indeed as Ronald Reagan claims. that the Soviet
Union is the greatest threat to world peace today. it is ln~
conceivable that his administration would attempt to harm
israel which has. unlike the Arab states or our European

allies acted in a way consistent with American global ln- ..

Soviet Threat

To the Editor:

Barry Commoner's presentation on “The Politics of
Disarmament" was an affront to the intelligence of Albany
State students. Commoner's idealistic view of the Soviet
Union's foreign policy bears little resemblance to harsh
reality: the Soviet‘s ultimate goal is global domination. In
quoting from a Soviet booklet. Commoner misleadingly
suggests that the Soviet government not only desires peace.
but is aghast at the prospect of nuclear war and maintains
conventional forces for defense purposes alone.

.

if the Soviet Union desires peace and opposes nuclear
war. why have they not followed Commoner's suggestion
that nuclear weapons be destroyed? Although the United
States alone possessed nuclear weapons from 1945 to I949.
its leaders put forward such a proposal—the Baruch Plan.
Under this 1946 plan. the US. offered to destroy its atomic
bombs. Interestingly, the peace-loving U.S.S.R. rejected
the plan. objecting to the provision for unlimited inspection
of nuclear facilities that was necessary to ensure their
peaceful use. To date. the Soviet Union has never con-
sented to onjsite Inspections.

The assertion that the Soviet leaders are peace-loving is
weakened further by the experience of recent years. While
the United States reduced national defense spending (in
constant dollars) by over one-third from 1968 to I979. the
Soviet Union increased defense spending by roughly one-
third. The United States is not preparing for “.lonestown
on a global scale" as Commoner fears. The so-cailed arms
buildup is rooted in persistent Soviet aggression. not in
American desires.

The Soviet violations of past treaties also highlight the
values of the Soviet leadership. The U.S.S.R. has violated

'the 1925 Geneva Protocol, the l945 Yalta and Potsdam

agreements. the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and
the 1975 Helsinki accords. in the process. Soviet leaders
have discarded any pretense of respect for human rights or
for national sovereignty. Their use of chemical and
biological warfare also reﬂects their moral insensitivity and
ruthlessness.

The Soviet Union is not concerned only with providing
adequate defense of its borders as Commoner suggests. His
explanation that “the Soviet Union didn't invade
Afghanistan until President Carter announced deployment
of the Rapid Deployment Force" is a feeble attempt at
justifying their acts of brutal aggression. Does Mr. Com-
moner have an equally plausible explanation for the
presence of Soviet military and civilian advisers in Latin

America. Africa. Asia. and the Middle East?‘ '

The Soviet Union has different aims than Commoner
purports and our foreign policy must reﬂectthls'reallty.
The current Soviet view of peace is perhaps best embodied
in Lenin's historic words: “As an ultimate objective peace
simply means Communist world control." The U.S.
foreign policy must strive for the attainment of the twin
goals of peace and freedom. American leaders undoubtedly
would prefer that peace and freedom could exist un-
challenged without a need for military forces; unfortunate-
ly. because of Soviet aggression. “peace through strength"
remains a vital doctrine. .

The United States should. of course. continue offering
proposals for nuclear arms reductions and freezes. Any
agreement must be mutual. verifiable and equitable. The
ability to reach such an agreement will require the Soviet
Union to reverse their past anti-peace thrust. One should
keep in mind that we are dealing with a communist nation
that murdered over 20 million of its own people in its for-
mative years. Hopefully. current leaders wil1,for‘ge a new
Soviet tradition of humanity rather than add to their sor-
rowful record of murder and oppression.

At the same time. debate on the ideological foundations
of the United States and the Soviet Union should continue.
This is another arena where the US. has taken bold in-
itiatives. Contrary to Commoner's assertion. American
political leaders. unlike their Soviet counterparts. have not
been "afraid" to engage in thoughtful debate on this topic.

 

“The so-called arms buildup
is rooted in persistant Soviet
agression, not in American
desires.”

 

 

A prominent example was President Reagan's speech on
June 8. I982 before the British Parliament in which he
clearly set forth the idealogical differences between the two
nations. in his speech he challenged the Soviet leaders to
live up to their rhetoric. Reagan stated: “i am prepared to
offer President Brezhnev an opportunity to speak to the
American people on our television if he will allow me the
same opportunity with the Soviet people." To date,
Brezhnev remains silent. perhaps highlighting the intellec-
tual bankruptcy of the Soviet system. The Soviet leaders.
who continue to preside over a war on their own people.
shun serious discussion of the basic tenets of their op-
pressive society. ~

Commoner's attack on Reagan's military policies is
misdirected. founded as it is on naive perceptions of Soviet

ambitions.
