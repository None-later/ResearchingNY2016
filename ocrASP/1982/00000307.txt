Netmen get in swing of things

By Mike Dinowitz
surf WRITER

With the end of September
quickly approaching. the Albany
State men’s tennis team have gotten
into the swing at this fall season.
Playing two matches over this past
week. The Netters found themselves
coming up with very mixed results.
They started off the week hosting a
dual match against West Point and
the University of Vermont; and
later on in the week faced fellow
SUNYAC member Oneonta State.

The dual match did not turn out
as bright as The Great Danes may
have wanted. but never the less.
they offered some tough competi-
tion. Albany ﬁrst played Vermont
and fell to them 6-3. winning only
two of six singles matches and los-
ing two of three doubles contests.

Boaters win

<Baok Page

Coach Schicffclin was ecstatic
with his club’s performance. “They
just keep on getting better. I am
very happy with today’s perfor-
mance. The team was depressed
after the first half, Tommy have up
the goal and we couldn't do
unythiug offensively. but they come
back." said Sclticffelin.

Pluttsburgh coach Uwc Mcwcr.
showing his disappointment said,
“We dominated Iltc game. but they
(Albany) beat us.”

Albany had previously beaten
Skidntore 3-0 on two goals from
Bacchus and one from Mike Conol-
ly, and tied Oswcgo 0-0. The Danes
have also beatcn Hampton.
England in an exhibition l—0. Thcy
opened the season with a two game
invitational tournament in Mon-
treal at McGiil University. dropping
both matches 2-0.

Dcspitc losing Ail-American
Afrim chaj and several other
seniors. the Danes are a better
balanced club then last year's 7-7-i
team. They have added two all-
confcrcncc transfer players.
halfback Terry Bacchus from
Fultoh Montgomery Community
College and swccpcr Mike Miller
from Rocklund County Community
College.

Miller is the stalwart of what
Schicfl‘clin culls Itti "outstanding
defense". Along with returning Ict-
tcrman Jerry lsttucs. the two give
the Danes a pair of legitimate All-
Amcrican candidates. “Only time
will tell." said Shicfl‘clin. “But
Jcrry (lsuacs) surely played like an
All-American today."

A major question mark before
the season began wus goaltender.
Six guys were fightng tor the star-
ting job. The answer seems to be
Merritt.'r'-”Hc certainly doesn't
play like a freshman. He saved two
surc goals itt games last week. The
thing is he just keeps on
improving." said Schicffclin.

, The element of this year's team
that impresses Schicffclin is the
Danes' “cohesiveness”. “They pull
together when they get in tight cor~
ncrs. You wonder when a team
starts off playing so well, but l'm
[rightfully happy ltcctrusc they keep
improving musty grime."

The singles winners were Lawrence
Eichen. who played in the number
four slot and Dave Grossman who
played sixth singles.

The Dance then went on to play
West Point.'who they have never
bcaten at home. Albany won four
of six singles matches. but dropped
all 3 doubles matches and lost to
Army_ by a score of 5-4.

It was a tough loss. in anticipa-
tion of beating Army for the ﬁrst
time. The highlight of the match
came in a first singles contest bet-
ween Albany's Barry Levine and
Army’s John Bell. in an extremely
"exciting" match with Levine win-
ning the match 4-6. 6-3. 6-3. Other
singles winner includcd Eichcn.

Dave Lerner. and Orossman.

Last Wednesday. Albany faced
Oneonta State. and beat them 9-0.
in a very one sided match. As a mat-
ter of fact, Oneonta did not win a
single set against the Great Danes
competition.

This weekend. Albany will be
hosting the sixth annual, Great
Dane Tournament. Fifteen teams
will be present. including Concor-
dia College, University of
Rochester. St. Johns, and Univcrsi-
ty of Vermont. The tournament will
be taking place all day Friday and
Saturday. Albany hopes to improve
their standing over past years in the
tourney and are looking forward to.
doing well.
