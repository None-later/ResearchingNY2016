Pennant races come to Climax

(AP) As the days dwindle down to a
precious few, baseball’s September
song is building a pennant race
climax that probably won’t be
decided until the ﬁnal weekend of
the regular season.

Going into Thursday's games,
Los Angeles held a three-game lead
over Atlanta and 4% over San
Francisco in the National League
West, in a race that the three teams
can decide head to head.

Of the Dodgers’ ﬁnal i0 games,
six are against the Giants — three
this weekend in Los Angeles and
three in San Francisco next
weekend when the season ends. Los
Angeles also plays two games at
home against the Braves.

-' Atlanta finishes its home

schedule this weekend against San

Diego and then spends the ﬁnal

Week of the season on a California

road trip with two games in San

Francisco and two more in Los

Angelcs. The Braves ﬁnish the

season in San Diego and will be

Kansas City has lost six in a row
to slip from two games in front to
three behind. “We've got to win
our last 10 games." said Howser.
“That's all there is to it."

After this weekend in Oakland.

season's ﬁnal seven games — the

a 2'/z-game lead over Baltimore and

Baltimore begins a three-game
series in Milwaukee Friday night
and the same two teams will ﬁnish
the season against each other with
four games in Baltimore the final
weekend. »
