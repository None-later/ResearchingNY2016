A committee was appointed by President
Vincent O'Leary to reorganize the Rhetoric
and Communications (RCO) department in
the wake of a hiring freeze which prevented
the department from ﬁlling three full time
faculty lines.

According to acting Rhetoric and Com-
munications chair. Dr. Kathleen Kendall.
“By freezing vacant faculty lines. no one
individual was hurt. The problem is the
department was very much hurt.”

Kendall said, “The increasing turnover in
the department is hard for the University to
understand. it looks bad. The people are
leaving for mobility within the ﬁeld. more
money and convention expenses, more
secretarial services. and a better chance of
tenure. The tenure standards are very high
here.“

RCO currently has seven full-time and
one part time professor. Three vacant posi-
tions have not been filled.

Acting Assistant Vice President for
Academic Affairs. Martha Rozett.
recognized that, “Most departments have
more stability. With RCO. there is a large
turn-over. When a faculty line opens up. it
becomes vulnerable to be frozen."

Rozett said two tenure tracks have been
filled. and a new assistant professor was
hired for the department with another ar-

 

riving in January.

“The department couldn't go on the way
it was with open lines (faculty vacancies)
and a large student demand. Communica-
tions is a mobile and popular field where
people come and go. Additionally. there is
an enormous increase in communication
majors."

Although Rozett recognizes RC0 is a
popular major. she feels it isn’t necessary to
allow more majors into the departmént.

Hiring freeze hurts RCO department

"We may have to tighten requirements and
introduce new pre-requisites to discourage
those not serious."

The RCO department is concentrating on
satisfying the needs of its graduate students.
Kendell said. “Some faculty are teaching at
the graduate level and don't have time to
teach undergraduate cources also."

Less faculty has resulted in fewer course
offerings. Discussion sections were reduc~
ed. while class sizes were increased to in-

clude as many students Is Mine.

“Most courses that were not offered in
the fall will be offered In the spring”
Kendell encouraged. “ No courses were cut
out permanently. They're Just not offered
as often." she said.

Kendall does not anticipate any further
staff feductions but said the RCO depart-
ment might be moved to the School of
Social and Behavioral Sciences. Joint ap-
pointments of members of various depart-
ments may be made. "Things are in a state
of flux." said Kendell. “We don't know
what the future holds."

Kosher kitchen on Dutch expanded

 

By Lisa Pazer

From the frozen TV dinners that were
served 10 years ago to today's full service
facility complete with a salad bar. the UAS
Kosher kitchen on Dutch quad has evolved
into reportedly the largest college Kesher
meal plan in the country. according to
Kosher chef Jay Kollman.

The newly expanded kitchen. according
to Director of Contract Food Services. Ron
Clough. cost approximately 320.000. and
includes food preparation facilities twice as
large as last year. Lunch is now served in
addition to dinner. and a mini-serve line in
the front of the cafeteria replaces the ser-
vice table originally partitioned off in the

rear.

The expanded menu more closely
parallels the regular UAS menu. and
features beef and turkey versions of bacon.
liverwurst. and ham that come from local
kosher meat outlets. The baked goods are
su plied locally and all food is made under
Orthodox Rabbinic approval.

increased student demand for kosher
meals and the hope to lure more kosher
students to SUNYA were the main reasons
behind the move to expand the kitchen's
facilities. according to Clough. but despite
the increased capacity of the kitchen. only
kosher students with verification letters
from their Rabbis will still be able to pur-

chase the plan. The kitchen currently serves
185 lunches and 240 dinners daily.

The student reaction to the expanded
menu and new facilities seems favorable.
Hayes Dansky. a student on the plan. says
“there is a wider selection than last year.
and it's good that its not segregated
anymore. The variety ofchoices is the big-
gest improvement."

“The vegetables are better than regular"
according to Ellen Dickter. while Mike
Block thinks “the deserts are delicious."

However, the lack of a dairy selection is
one problem cited by students on the plan.
Dansky misescheese. while another student
wishes they could find a way to make
-Kosher lasagna.
