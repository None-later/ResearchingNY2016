Ranked 5th in the nation in productivity and among
the top twenty regarding reputation. the School of
Public Administration at the SUNYA is regarded as
one of the nation's finest by treads of HS graduate
progratns in public administration and public affairs.
according to the SUNY News last summer.

Program administrators were polled in a study con-
ducted by the University of Oklahoma's Bureau of
Government Research in conjunction with the Univer‘
sity of South Carolina's Department of Government
and International Studies. a study said to be the first
attempt to rank programs in public administration.

The study. published by the American Society for
Public Administration inPub/lc Adminislrulion
Review. ranked schools according to their reputation
in academic circles and by the number of journal ar-
ticles published by graduate students and members of
the program's faculty.

The School of Public Administration is part of the
Graduate School of Public Affairs. which. in turn. is
part of the Nelson A. Rockefeller College of Public
Affairs and Policy. The Rockefeller College also
houses schools of political science and criminal justice.
as well as many other public affairs related programs.

The graduate program for public administration was
formally established by SUNYA in I962. according to
the Rockefeller College program guide. to "...provide
education preparation for academic and public service
careers to undertake research on significant public pro-
hlems and issues and to assist in the continuing profes-
sional development. of government executives."

Since its establishment. the program and its sister
programs of the Rockefeller College have been one of
the fastest growing schools at the University attd of
major emphasis in the University system. The Mission
Statement of 1977 regarding the development of public
affairs and policy programs at the University stated
that “...thc University at Albany will place high priori-
ty on basic and applied research efforts which address
policy issues of broad public concern.“and will slip-
port research which “...provides the necessary

 

blcms facing New York to become involved. This em-
phasis on public affairs ltas made the university‘s pro-
gram one of the best of its kind.

According to Warren llchman. Vice-President for
Research and Graduate Studies. the University
"educates more people who enter the public service of
the State titan does any other institution. public or
private. and undertakes more public-affairs-rclated
research and training for New York State than all
other campuses of the SUNY system combined."

The Task Force on Public Affairs and Policy was
established by the University’s President to evaluate
SUNYA's progress toward meeting the goals stated in
the Mission Statement in January of l9Bl. They con-
firmed in their Report to Ilre President in March of
that year that the University had made considerable
progress toward these goals.

Timothy Price. a first yettr graduate student in the
Rockefeller College. says the faculty is a great asset in
the program. He states that the professors‘ approaches
are “very human" and that they are always helpful.
He believes the programs' emphasis on class discussion
play an important role in the value of courses and that
the issues utilil.ed are "relevant and tip to date." He
also believes the program to be very helpful in job
placement. and that interships protnoted by the pro-
gram are helpful in procuring potential positions.

Dr. Harold W. Adams of Public Administration
concurs that job placement and preparation is a ongo-
ing priority of the program because admission to the
public service is “not easy." He stated that the public
service wants people who have specific rlactical skills
and a strong ability to think formally and analytically
to solve practical problems. Public service ls highly
technical. he said. and that the "days are over when
you could just want to be in the public service."

Budget and job cuts as well as hiring freezes in the
public service ltave strongly contributed toward mak-
ing it u more competitive field. Adams said. Also.
more inlluencc is being placed on computer science,
economics and statistics. He said a major move in this
direction oecured last year. when the Masters Degree
