Listen to the Victim

As a rape victim, it seems to me
that most people. male and
female, even those who are sym-
pathetic toward the victim, do
not fully understand the nature
of forcible rape.

i believe that most view this
crime as forced sex or intercourse.
in the sense that this intercourse
does not differ much in a
physiological respect from that of
consentual intercourse. Hence.
“men seem incapable of
understanding what rape means
to women." Forcible rape is not
in any normal sense intercourse.
In most cases, the lubrication of
the vagina required for normal
completed intercouse does not ex-
ist, since petting has. more often
than not, not occurred. As a
result of this crucial aspect, as
well as the fact that the victim is
usually in a traumatized state im-
mediately preceeding the rape
and, thus, the muscles at the en-
trance to the vagina are not relax-
ed, penetration cannot either
easily or immediately occur.
What does happen is that the
rapist repeatedly batters with his
penis the very delicate and sen—
~itlve features lying outside the
vagina. causing the tissues to tear
and to bleed. When the force of
the thrusting eventually results in
:he penis entering the vagina. it
.-nters usually no more than a few
inches, and again the tissues (this
time. the lining of the vagina)
are repeatedly, with each thrust,
ripped and torn.

As can be imagined, forcible
rape is traumatically painful. I
believe that this is the most
physically painful ordeal that an
individual can undergo and still
live afterward. When I was being
raped, l felt as though l were be
ing repeatedly stabbed with a

tissues of the lower part of my
vaginal walls remained ripped.
Thus, not only do people fail to
comprehend the severe pain in-
volved in a rape. or the length of
the time that the victim must suf«

that the physical damage done to

was in shock. i felt numb and
could feel no pain, but I knew
that the rapist was tearing ine

as though I had been set on fire.
Although I bled for only a few
days. the pain lasted for weeks.
"What harm does it do!" Some
of my external genitalia has been
battered away. it simply does not
exist anymore. Other areas are
torn or snagged. Some of the
flesh can be pulled apart. Most of
my hymen has been obliterated,
with a ragged circular edge of
tissue left in its place. lnside my
vagina. the muscles at the en-
trance are damaged and i fear
that this will adversely affect any
future sexual intercourse that l
engage in. Polyps have developed

the genital organs does not repair
itself with time and that rape is a
inutilating. disfiguring crime.

Haskell states that "the in-
tegratedness with which a
woman experiences love and sex
and herself is what makes rape
devastating." But. this is not the
whole truth because there is no
"sex" in rape. There is only pain
— traumatic. physical pain — and
i believe that this is what makes
rape devastating.

Perhaps her theory best ex-
plains the rampant fear of rape as
experienced by the majority of
women who have never been and
will never be raped. and who.
therefore. do not anticipate hav-

ing their vaginas ripped open and
torn for 15 minutes, but rather
some sort of sex.

I have listened to many women
say that it is probably better to
submit to rape than to endanger
one's life by resisting, all the
while knowing in my heart that
they had no idea as to the kind of
hell they would be in for. l
presumed they felt that they

would be submitting to sex. II
myself, could not have imagined
what rape was really like until it
happened. l think this confusion
betWeen sex and rape is largely
responsible for male fantasies of it
being pleasurable for the \’ltlllll.
for its glorification in llit' movies
'as such. and for the n-latiwly
light sentences imposed by judges
on convicted rapists.

What Rape Means

According to Webster, rape is
the “illicit carnal knowledge of a
woman without her consent, ef-
fected by force, duress, intimida-
tion or deception as to the nature
of the act." Rape is a crime against
women. Rape is a deadly insult
against you as a person. Rape is
the deprivation of sexual self-
determination. Rape is a man's
fantasy, a woman's nightmare.
Rape is all the hatred, contempt,
and oppression of women in this
society concentrated in one act.

Rape is not a special, isolated
act. It is not an aberration. a
deviation from the norms of sex-
ual and social behavior in this
country. Rape is simply at the end
of the continuum of male—
aggrei;sive, female-passive pat- -

terns, and an arbitrary line has
been drawn to mark it off from the
rest of such relationships. That
line is superficially imposed and
accounts for the tremendous con-
fusion that arises when we try to
talk about rape. lt accounts for the
difficulty the laws and the courts
have in prosecuting a rapist. lt ac-
counts for the fact that the
average person will condemn rape
as a crime eqivalent to murder,
but will have little sympathy for
the actual victim ofa rape, and. as
juror. will acquit the rapist nine
times out of ten. We muddle
around trying to draw artificial
lines in the actual behavior of real
persons, and we find that it can-
not be done. If it happens in an
alley, it’s rape; if it happens. in

 

Intimidation:

bed, it's love. if the man is a
stranger. it’s rape; if he's your
date, it's love. If he hits you full in
the face, it’s rape; if he merely
overpowers you, it's love.

Rape is any sexual intimacy
forced on one person by another.
Rape differs from acceptable sex-
ual relations in one. and only one,
concrete way. One person is un-
willing and is therefore forced. lt
would be possible. under our
definition. for a woman to rape a
man. We are not going to deal
specifically "with that possibility
simply because we feel that it is so
rare in comparison to the reverse
situation that to deal with it at 'all
would be to overemphasize its im-
portance. There are reasons that it
is rare and they should become
clear as we go along.

What Are WomenDefending Against

by Maggie Boys

The rapist is the schoolyard bulr
ly with a grown-up's Weapon. It
has been said again and again that
tape is an act of intimidation, one
person asserting power over
another. In very plain words. rape
is an extreme form of bullying.

This information is vital for
women’s self-defense, because it
means that l) we don’t have to
wait for a rapist to grab us before
we start fighting, 2) since 65—75%
of rapists are acquainted with
their victims, we can learn to de-
fend ourselves against the largest
portion of rapists, and not just the
stranger—in-the—night variety.

To do this. we must expand the
meaning of the term
"self-defense.” Traditional self—
defense courses. those not taught
with the rapist's motivation clear-
ly in mind. prepare the student for
situations where a fight is immi‘
nent or where a physical attack
has actually begun. Oc 'sionally,
such a course may be adapted for
the female student by mention of
rattail combs and a list of precau-
tions. Rattail combs can be useful
and taking certain precautions is
definitely the first step to suc-
cessfully preventing violent at-
tacks (see Precautions).

But even a woman well—trained
in fighting risks injury when she
must ward off an attacker much
larger than herself. And anyway.
who wants to fight if it isn‘t
necessaryl Furthermore, We are
still vulnerable if we do not learn
to recognize the intimidation stage
that often preceded a rape at’
tempt.

Women. therefore, have to
understand self—defense not as
something to do when grabbed on
the street, but as a way of living
free from intimidation in our

home lives as well as on the street.

intimidation does not always
take the form of threats. Often,
especially coming from people
(men. let’s face it) who know us,
it makes us feel we are not worth
the effort of defending. Frequently
too, intimidation may be someone
playing on our guilt by acting
angry or offended. Another very
subtle form of intimidation is the
letvme-protect—you line, which is
essentially a way of asserting that
you are vulnerable and he is more
powerful. These and other forms
of manipulation are used to
disarm women emotionally and ;

 

ready us for the more extreme
form of intimidation called rape.
Saying NO to manipulation in
our relationships with men, in-
timate or casual, can help prevent
rape.

These same forms of bullying
are used by the stanger-rapist to
select and entrnp victims (see

James Sckin. Rape in Psychology ‘

Today, January. 1975). They are
also sometimes used by muggers
for the same purpose. Who among
us has not been asked directions
from a car and, on approaching.
been assaulted with lewd remarks
or invitations to “go for a ride!"
Not always, but sometimes. the

Don’t Stop

invitation becomes an actual at-
tack. Reacting loudly and angri-
ly to such intimidation attempts
will usually convince the assailant
that you are not an easy target.
This effectively ends the rape at‘
temp before it becomes a physical
fight. Besides that, it can give you
a tremendous feeling of exhilara-
tion.

Self’defense for women,
,therefore, is more than learning
how to fight. It is also learning
how to avoid the necessity of
fighting by taking precautions and
taking a strong stand against in-
timidation.

The Presses

Sexual assaults are traditionally
under—reported crimes because of
their perceived personal nature
and the tremendous psychological
impact on the victims. A woman,
already traumatized by the attack.
may not wish to be interviewed or
photographed. Victims know that
sensitive press treatments of rape
are rare, and sensationalized ar-
ticles are common. Rapes are
newsworthy, but victims require
privacy.

in addition, most newspapers
apply the same rigorous standards
of police corraboration to reports
of rape that they. do to other
crimes. Police have been unwilling
to confirm reports of rape because
they fear inciting a panic among
local women. This paternalistic at-
titude is not helpful; unaware of
the danger, we cannot protect
ourselves. Their official silence,
however instrumental to their inv
vestigation, hinders the publicity
that may save other women from
falling victim to the rapist.

Many of the most important
results of rape are non-events; an
attendance drop at evening classes
and nctivities,,decreased numbers
of women using the library, a
general decline in the number of
women who participate in on» and
off«campus life. The University
and community lose out when
women Withdraw their contribu-
tions, cease their participation. and
retreat to the locked, barred con-
fines of their rooms. Losses of this
sort tireless dramatic thantgains.

- -,. I . , . l '

journalism is geared toward
reporting events; an innovative
editor should be able to pick up
on those stories that are not
covered under that heading.

The aftermath of rape is a
retreat from the public eye by the
victim of the rapist and a retreat
from public life by victims of the
fear engendered in all women.
There is a tendency. also. for the
crime to disappear from the publicl
eye, along with its victims. This
must not be allowed to happen.

It is clear that, for these crimes.
police reports are unreliable, and
certainly not legitimate criteria of
news—worthiness. Nor do conven-
tional journalistic techniques suit
the media coverage of violence
against women. We suggest that
local media adopt an alternative
focus and regularly report the

responses of the University and.

community to women’s demands
for safety and free access. It is also
important to examine the types of
media which serve to perpetuate
common myths leading to rape.
For example. an analysis of
popular music will reveal lyrics
that portray women as weak and
submissive to men, willing and
wanting to accept this position.

Popular music servos as a maln‘

source of entertainment for our
culture; a fact which necessitates
concern about the messages it gets
across.

Other types of media which
reinforce typical attitudes of rape
