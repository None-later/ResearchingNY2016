Every year our fathers. brothers.
husbands and boyfriends con’
some increasing amounts of por-
nographic materials, contributing
to a multi-billion dollar a year in-
dustry. Each year the amount of
violence towards women depicted
in pornography increases. Even in
Playboy and other softrcore por-
nography magazines depictions of
violenco against women have
become more and more common.
And, more widely accepted. The
recent escalation of violence in
pornography has been evidenced
in the proliferation of scenes of
bondage. rape and torture of
women for the sexual stimulation
of male viewers.

The Int

it is commonly believed that the
availability of pornography actual-
ly decreases the amount of
violence towards women. if it were
true that exposure to pornography
provided a release for male sexual
aggressive tendencies, then the
available pornographic materials
would result in a decrease in the
incidence of rape and other acts of
violence against women. in fact,
rape and violent acts are increas‘
ing even with the proliferation of
pornographic materials.

Links between pornography
and rape are easy to find in the
myths and messages com-
municated to the public through
its stereotypes of rape victims. Por-
nography is the main perpetrator
of myths depicting rape as sexually

In a college study, 51% of the men said that

(Feshback and Malamuth.

1977)

 

Accompanying this rise of
violence towards women in pot-
nography has been the real-life
rise of violence towards women. in
the 1960’s alone. FBl statistics in-
dicated that rape had increased by
93%. Today. every few seconds in
America. a woman or girl is sexr
ually or physically abused. And if
statistics are near right. at least one
out of every four women reading
this article will at some time in her
life become the victim of some
such abuse.

Rape: A

An essential factor to be con-
sidered in analyzing rape is the
issue of race. and the common
myths that are held when dealing
with this aspect. Assaults and
rapes in our community and
everywhere have been carried out
by men of all races. in fact. it has
been |m'oven that most rapes occur
within the same racial group. The
myth that only Black men rape
has kept us from identifying our
enemy and striking out. Those
who believe that their lily white
neighborhoods and suburban for-

resses insulate them from this
hideous crime are being scanw
dalously deceived. in fact. more
than fifty percent of all rape vic—
tims knew their rapist before the
attack(s) and most rapes occur in
the home. And so. it is not in
dark alleys by dark men that we
are violated. We are raped by rail.
men and short men. fat and thin.‘
old and young. light and dark. .

Few Black women who havei
been raped, particularly. if the'
rapist was white, are willing to

stimulating to the victim. "reveal—
ing" that in actuality "all women
want to be raped." images in por—
nography have led the general
public to believe that rape victims
"ask for it." "get their kicks out of
it," and in some way “deserve it."

in pornography. women’s bodies
(and especially their genitals) are

,displayed as dehumanized objects

to be exposed. manipulated. abus-
ed and mutilated. Because of this
objectification and dehumaniza-
tion the actual pain and horror

 

which women experience w
raped is minimized and in many
cases totally dismissed.
Pornography promotes acts of
violence against women. in one
study of the effects of por-
nography on college men, after be-
ing exposed to only one depiction
of rape in pornography. "51% of
the men said that they might commit
rape if they were assured they would

hen ' not be caught." (Feshback and

Malamuth. 1977.) Similar results

' have been found in many other

studies along with reports from
police officers that rapists are often
found with pornographic
materials in their possession.

it is esshtial to recognize that in
a society where pornography is
widely accepted. the attitudes of
the general public towards women

nneoﬂon

will at best be unfavorable and at
worst will condone and justify acts
Iof violence towards women. “The
open display of pornography pro-
motes an atmosphere in which
acts of hostility against women are
.not only tolerated. but encourag-
ed." (Susan Brownmiller. Against
Our Will. Simon 8L Schuster.
1977.

Racist Issue

talk about it. This form of racism
and sexism combined is seen by
many Blacks as doubly
humiliating and degrading as a
brutal reminder of the past when
such rape was commonplace.

in the days of slavery, Black
women rationalized white men's
desire to use them to satisfy all
their "sinful" sexual urges. At the
other extreme. white men placed
white women on a pedastal as
pure. sexless, virtuous beings. Out
of this dichotomization of women
into black whore and white virgin
arose the belief that to satisfy sex—
ually the Black women, the queen
of sex. was proof of true
manhood. In addition. many
whites View Black men as
superstuds. The fantasy that they
have larger genitals and a greater
sexual capacity is widespread. it
follows that if a white man can
satisfy a Black woman. the latter
of which is presumed to be no
customed to Black men as lovers.
then surely white men are also
studs.

if we hate the Black man and
acknowledge only him as rapist we
can conveniently be diverted from
recognizing the real roots of rape.
The existence of rape in any form
is beneﬁcial to the ruling class of
white males. For rape is a kind of
terrorism which severely limits the
freedom of women and makes us
dependent on man. Moreover. in
the act of rape. the rage that one

man may harbor toward another

higher in the male hierarchy can
be deﬂected toward a female
scapegoat. For every man, there is
always someone on the social scale
upon whom he can take out his
aggressions. And that is any
woman alive. in other words. we
are pitted against each other to
help maintain the existing
capitalist, white, male dominated
structure. Racism is a serious issue
to be dealt with. and in analyzing
rape. sterotypes must be examined
carefully. Getting to the root
causes of rape will not be achieved
in any other way.

People are often quite surprised
when they hear about individuals
with handicapped conditions be-
ing the targets of sexual harass—
ment. molestation, incest.
assaults. obscene phone calls.
rapes, dirty remarks, and other
crimes against the person. Most
people are at once riddled with
disbelief, revulsion, and other
similar emotions. Yet. the fact re—
mains that many people with
ldisabilitics experience those types
of crimes at a rate comparable to
or greater than the general
population. Let us examine some
of the possible reasons why this
phenomenon occurs so frequent—

y.

Most so—calied sexual crimes are
not crimes of passion, but ex—
amples of people with some
perceived or real measure of
power acting out against
someone they see as a powerless
victim. You know. "might makes
right” and all that rot. People
with disabilities are often viewed
as vulnerable. delicate, somewhat
less than perfect human beings.
So it follows that the correlate
behaviors demonstrated would
reﬂect that point of view.

And then we have other people
who are simply attracted (sexual—
ly and otherwise) to disabled in-
dividuals for the thrill of it'. the
perverse lure of something dif
ferent. 1 liken that to the circus
freak show phenomenon whicl‘
has been so popular in this and
other countries for decades.

Another prevalent attitude
which manifests into behavior is

. similar to the last example. There

are some able bodied individuals
who only want to be associated
with disabled people because it
makes them feel comfortable.

Fact;

secure and superior. Thar bring»
us to the power issue. The dis»
abled are viewed as a vehicle for
demonstrating superiority. After
all. if they can‘t walk. talk. see.
hear. etc.. then they must be
flawed. inferior beings. if this l~
the underlying belief. then a per-
son who is a social or anti—social.
lacking in self-esteem and con»
fidence. limited in their outlook
and perhaps somewhat perverse
in their nature, would naturally
feel like ti superior being com!
pared to their perception of “the
down trodden masses."

Another possible explanation
for the behaviors we have been
examining is socio-economic in
scope. Millions of disabled
Americans are hindered in their
efforts to ﬁnd gainful employ-
merit. They are systematically
discriminated against because it is
felt that they cannot perform as
well as a person without ii
disability. Many are forced to live
on subsistence incomes in high
crime neighborhoods where they
are constantly and repeatedly
subjected to crimes against their
person.

The last explanation 1 will sug-
gest has to do with human
nature, the way we were brought
up. Somehow people have gotten
into the habit of asking disabled
individuals extremely personal
questions they would not dream
of asking others. After all, if we
don't view the disabled in the
same light as others. then we are
fostering behavior and attitudes
which fall beyond the acceptable
domain. We continue to separate
our disabled brothers and sisters
geographically. economically and
psychologically from society and
its norms. As a related conse-
quence. we treat them according—
ly.

56% of rapes occur in either the victims’ or assailants'

home.

The Little
Rapes

 

 

 

Medical Car
Wh

The medical attention which a
woman receives after an assault
should include three areas of treat—
ment and testing: injuries (both inter-
nal and external). pregnancy preven-
tion. and sexually transmitted
diseases.

Treatment of injuries:

This requires a thorough ex-'

amination of the woman's body

for any bruises or lacerations in— '

curred during the assault: scrapes
on the shoulders. back. elbows.
face and head injuries. bites. etc.
A shot of tetanus toxoid is rev
quiretl if there are open wounds
and if the victim has not had :i
teiiinus shot within five years.

Most likely ii gynecological
history will be taken to find out
the age inensiruaiion began. If
and when menopause began. type
of contraception used. and any
major gynecological infection or
surgery the victim might have
bad. This informiiiion will provide
the doctor with a knowledge of
how to treat the injured person.
Also. included here will be an in
ternal gynecological examination.
Though this may be ii difficult ex-
perience to endure so soon after
this assault. it is necct‘snry to see if
there is any damage to the exter—
nal genitals. the vagina and the
cervix. The woman will be given
both a bi—manual and speculum
examination.

Pregnancy prevention:

The risk of becoming pregnant
is rare during a rape. Many
women already use a continuous
form of birth control (the pill,
lUD. etc.). For women who were
using no contraception at the time
of the assault. there are three
possible actions to take:

1. Have a incnstruiil cxtriiciiiin
when the menstrual period is due.
During a menstrual exiraction. a
small plastic tube is inserted inio
the uterus to withdraw the uterine
lining. if an embryo is present. it
will be removed. in the United
States. menstrual extractions can
sometimes be obtained at
women’s self—help clinics, without
proof of pregnancy. However. in
Canada. menstrual extractions are
only used as a form of early aborv
tion. so proof of pregnancy is re-
quired.

2. Wait to see if the menstrual
period is late. if it is late, a
pregnancy test should be taken 6
weeks after the first day ofthe last
period. This will ensure reliable
results. Some of the newer
pregnancy tests will show positive
results sooner. but they will cer—
tainly be more expensive to use.
The sooner the pregnancy is con—
firmed. the easier any abortion
will be.

Sexually transmitted
diseases:

These diseases are spread from
one person to another by some
form of sexual Contact. They can
be passed through oral. anal. or
vaginal intercourse. Two forms
which can be most commonly
transmitted during an assault and
which have the most serious con.
sequences are gonorrhea and
syphilis.

l. Gonorrhea it takes about 10
days for gonorrhea to manifest
itself, so any tests done immediate’
ly after the assault will merely in-
dicate whether the woman had it
at the time ofthc attack. To make
sure that gonorrhea is not present.
it is necessary to have two negative
test results. These should be done
starting 2 weeks after the incident
at ‘one week intervals. Women

e
at To Do

should be certain that they are

tested in all areas which came into

sexual contact with the assailant

—- vagina. anus. mouth. and/or
‘ throat.

2. Syphilis To test for the
presence of syphilis, a blood test
(known as a VDRL) should be
taken 4-6 weeks after the rape inci-
dent. Since 25 percent of people
tested can have I‘false negative"
results. it is important that the
woman have a follow-up test 3
months later.

Some hospitals will give an-
tibiotics as a preventative treat-
ment for gonorrhea. There is
some controversy about this prac-
llt'L‘. It is possible that such treat-
ineiii t‘iin preveni the diagnosis of
syphilis. Some hospitals will give
the antibiotics automatically while
irlu-r places will only give them
on request. lfpossible. the woman
should talk to a doctor she trusts

“W”... .uW

before making the decision to ac-
cept this treatment.

It might be difficult for the
woman who has been assaulted to
remember to have the tests which
must be done several weeks or
months after the occurrence.
While she may be trying to forget
the experience and get back into
her regular routines, such tests
and examinations may be sore
reminders of the painful exr
perience. But these follow-up tests
are important for long-term good
health. A person who has sup-
ported the woman through the in-
itial decisions and experience
could offer to be responsible to see
that she goes to her follow-up ap-
pointments. The efforts will be
worthwhile. ensuring that there
will be no lingering medical pro-
blems for her to contend with in
the future.

Take Back The Night marches have become a symbol of
the feminist movement. Because we are constantly sub-
ject to the violent acts of men who rape. Taking Back
The Night enables us to show our determination to
break out of the cells, our rooms, apartments. houses,
which we are told to stay in “for our own good." Women
must have the right to walk alone at night.

 

It’s Not Your Fault

The tape was not your fault.

You are not going crazy . . . alv
most any reaction is normal.

This is a very serious crisis . . .
take very good care of yourself.

People’s reactions may hurt you

. they don’t understand. and

you must listen to things that
make you feel bad.

You are a victim of a crime.

You are a good woman.

You deserve all the help you can
get . . . ask for it.

You are not alone unless you
cut yourself off.

You will survive.

You have every right to cry.
scream and be as upset as you feel.

if you are really afraid that you
are going crazy or can't handle
yourself. go get professional care.
no matter what anyone says.

There are organizations out
there that can help you.

You are a valuable person.

Do whatever makes you feel bet-
ter.

This is the worst thing that's
ever happened to you . . . accept
that and act on it.

You are in no way responsible
for the rape.

Hang on. Take it five minutes at
a time if you have to . . . don't let
yourself feel overwhelmed.

Try to let out — get angry at
your rapist. . . stand in the middle
of the room and yell anything you
feel like to him as if he were there.

You are safe. even if you don't
feel it. The rape is over.

Try to find a sympathetic
woman/women and talk about it.

if someone is reacting to your
rape in a way that hurts or upsets
you, stop them or get away from
them. Even if it's your husband/
lover/best friend. You come first.

Find some object (anything that
helps) to hold in your hand, if
necessary.

Try to think as clearly as you
can about what's good for you and

it.

Make yourself talk about it to as
many sympathetic people as you
can.

There is nothing to be ashamed
about.
