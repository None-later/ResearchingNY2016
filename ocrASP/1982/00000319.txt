The woman was eighteen years
old, a college freshman and a
virgin. She had been rather strict-
ly brought up but she was strong-
willed and was testing her
freedom. That night she went to a
fraternity party with a young man
she had dated a few times before.
He told her it would be a long par-
ty, lasting beyond the dormitory
closing hours. and so he had ar’
ranged for her to spend the night
with the girlfriend of one of his
fraternity brothers. After some
hesitation, she signed out over'
night. it was the first time she had
ever done that, and it seemed ex-
citing.

The party did end very late.
When it was over, her date in-
formed her that his fraternity
brother was going to spend the
night with his girlfriend, so she
couldn't go there. The dormitory
had already been closed for hours.

He offered to rent her a room in

a motel. Knowing that he would
meet with some resistance, he
talked to her for a long time,
reassuring her that it would be all
right and that he had no inten-
tion of coming in with her. She
couldn't go back to the dormitory
without waking her dorm mother
and taking the risk of being cam-
pused. Her date really managed to
make it seem that she would be
making a fuss over nothing if she
did not accept his offer. Of course,
he played on her fears of seeming
unsophisticated and naive. And
so. not knowing how to say that
she didn't trust him without of-
fending him, she said that she
would do it. it was really too bad,
she thought, that she couldn't
rent the room herself and leave
him in the parking lot. But she
never had much money and she
certainly didn’t carry the priCe ofa
motel room in her purse when go-
ing to a party. Besides, she didn't
know how you went about
renting motel rooms, or whether
they would rent one to an eigh—
teen year old girl.

When they got to the motel, he
walked her to her room. She was a
little afraid of the strange motel, so
that was all right with her. But
when they got to the room, he
didn't leave: he walked in and
closed the door behind him. She
asked him to leave, of course. He
said that he just wanted to sit
down for a minute before he drove
back to the fraternity house. He
had paid for the room, after all,
and it wasn't very generous of her
to ask him to get out when all he
wanted to do was sit down for a
minute.

They talked for a little while. He
was very natural, casual and relax—
ed. He didn't try to do anything,
but still she was uneasy. He came
to kiss her good night. Well. she
thought, she kissed him before
when they had gone out. So she
kissed him, trying to be firm but
friendly. That was when he push—
ed her onto the bed. pulled up her
skirt, pinned her down and raped

her.

She fought. in fact. she fought
very hard, but she was already on
her back and it didn't do much
good. He was quite a bit bigger
and stronger that she was. At that
point, she really didn't have a
chance.

it hurt a lot. He told her to stop
moving. She said she couldn’t, she
had given up the idea of ﬁghting
him off. At no time did he seem to
be overcome with desire. He
didn’t say anything nice to her,
but he didn't anything bad either.

Only that she should stop mov-
ing. He was annoyed that she
wouldn't lie still.

At any time during the attack
she might have grabbed the lamp
from the bedside table and hit him
over the head. She didn’t. When
it was over. he rolled over and
went to sleep. She lay on the bed
beside him. not moving, not sleep-
ing. until morning.

Do you believe that the women
in this story wanted to be raped!

 

The man who raped her did. in
fact, he did not believe that he
had raped her. if you agree with
him, if you think she got what she
wanted. maybe you can suggest
when she could have started
fighting. When he said he would
walk her to her room? When he
came into the room and said he
wanted to sit down for a while
before he went back! When he
kissed her good night? The first
two are too soon. There just

The Alternatives
On Campus

 

by Vincent O'Leary

 

As you may know, since l978 a
campus Task Force on Women's
Safety has addressed itself to con«
cerns of personal safety for women
on campus. Membership on the
Task Force is comprehensive and
includes representatives from
various campus constituencies ——
students, faculty and staff. A
number of programs have been in—
stituted by the Task Force to
make the campus more safe,
among some of the most impor-
tant are:

— increased Public Safety staff-
ing at the East Campus
(downtown)

— improved lighting at both the
Main Campus and the East Cam-
pus

— installation of the Blue Light
Emergency Phone System at
isolated and strategic campus loca-
tions

—- Student Patrol Escort Service

— Modification of bus schedules

— improvement in security
measures in the women's locker
room

All of these programs have in-
creased the personal safety of
women, and several of them
enhance everyone's safety.
However. not all members of the
University community are as
aware of these programs as they
might be.

To ensure that maximum
benefit is made of these services, i
feel it is necessary that all staff,
faculty and students are made
aware of these programs. it is
especially important that thoso
who either teach or attend night
classes be aware of the following:

2. Whenever possible, they
should walk at night with another
individual.

3. They should stay on wellv'
lighted walkways.

4. They should be aware of the
location of the Blue Light
Emergency Phone system and
public phones. Please note that
public pay phones can be used at
no cost in an emergency merely by
picking up the receiver and dialing
the operator. The Blue Light
phones provide a direct line to the
Department of Public Safety by
simply lifting the receiver.

5. A Student Patrol Escort Ser—
vice is available by calling
457r7616.

6. Those who wish training in
self defense can:

a. Arrange to take a course
through the Physical Education
Department.

b. Gather a group of twelve or
more and the University will pro
vide an instructor for a twovhour
workshop. Call the Affirmative
Action Office (457-8590) to ar-
range the workshops.

c. Call Gail Friedbcrg at
463-3564 if you would like addi-
tional information or if you are
unable to form or join a group.

The safety of all who study and
work on the campus is a major
concern. We have undertaken
major efforts to increase personal
safety with some success and we
want to sustain those efforts and
that success. Please relay this

message to your friends, staff,f

faculty or student, and please enr

' courage them to inform others of

would have no reason to start

considerable time speculating on
e true nature of the rapist.

 
 

When i was very young, my image
of the “sexual offender" was a
nightmarish amalgamation of the
bogey man and Captain Hook: he
wore a black cape, and he cackled.
As i matured, so did the image of
the rapist. Born into the
pSychoanalytic age, I tried to
"understand" the rapist. Rape, I
came to believe, was only one of
many unfortunate evils produced
by sexual repression. Reasoning
by tautology, [concluded that any
man who would rape a woman
must be out of his mind.

Yet, though the theory that
rapists are insane is a polular one.
this belief has no basis in fact. Ac-
cording to Professor Menachim
Amir's study of 646 rape cases in
Philadelphia, Patterns in Forcible
Rape, men who rape are not ab—
normal. Amlr writes, "Studies in-
dicate that sex offenders do not
constitute a unique or
psychopathologicai type; nor are
they as a group invariable more
disturncd than the control groups
to which they are compared."

Alan Taylor, a parole officer
who has worked with rapists in

the prison facilities at San Luis
Obispo. California. stated the
question in plainer language:
"Those men were the most nor'
mal men there. They had a lot of
hang-ups, but they were the same
hang-ups as men walking out on
the street."

Another canon in the
apologetics of rape is that, if it
were not for learned social con-
trols, all men would rape. Rape is
held to be natural behavior, and
not to rape must must be learned.
But in truth, rape is not universal
to the human species. Moreover.
studies of rape in our culture
reveal that, far from being im-
pulsive behavior, most rape is
planned. Professor Amir's study
reveals in cases of group rape (the
"ganghang" of masculine slang).
90 percent were planned; in pair
rapes, 83 percent were planned;
and in single rapes, 98 percent
were planned. These figures
should significantly discredit the
image of the rapist as a man who
is suddenly overcome by sexual
needs society does not allow him

to fulfill.

f ape: The All American Crime-

Far from the social control of.

rape being learned, comparisons

with other cultures lead one to'

suspect that, in our society, it is
rape itself that is learned. (The fact
that rape is against the law should
not be considered proof that rape
is not in fact encouraged as part of
our culture.)

The notion that rape is enjoyed
by the victim is” also convenient
for the man who. though he
would not commit rape, enjoys
the idea of its existence. Rape conr
firms that enormous sexual poten-
cy which he secretly knows to be
his own. it is for the pleasure of

the armchair rapist that detailed1

accounts of violent rape exist in
the media. Indeed, many men ap—
pear to take sexual pleaure from
nearly all forms of violence.
Whatever the motivation, male
sexuality and violence in our
culture seem to be inscperable.

The Rape Trauma Syndrome is the cluster of physical and
emotional symptoms that a rape victim experiences over time.
This syndrome has two phases: The Acute Reaction. in
which the victim's life style is completely disrupted by the rape
crisis, and the Long’term Process, in which the victim
begins to rc-adjust and re—organize her life. The symptoms of
the acute phase are not distinct from the symptoms oftbc long.

i. The Acute Reaction occurs at the time of attack and
may last for a few days or a month.

A. Affect — a feeling or emotion as disringuishcd from

cognition, thought or action which is apparent through

observed behavior.

Expressed emotion is revealed by crying. sobb-
ing, inappropriate laughter, etc. Feelings in-
cludc: fear of physical injury and death; loss of
control and self-esteem; anxiety; anger; humilia-

lion.

2. Controlled emotion is masked or hidden. Therc
is a discrepancy between the victim's overt
behavior and the tragedy that has occurcd. The
victim is composed and calm.

l3. Physical Reactions —— Victims describe a variety of
symptoms which are related to their emotional state:
general feeling of soreness all over lhe body.

2. specific areas of the body that are painful from

the attack.

3. disturbed sleep patterns. it is not uncommon for
victim to weep or cry out in her slccp. if the at-
tack occurred in the victim’s bed, it may be dif'
ficult for her to sleep alone or even return to

that bed.

Loss of appetite.

C. Emotional Reaction

l. General irritability
Z. Prcoccupation with self and one's safety.

D. Thought

In the spectrum of male
behavior. rape, the perfect com-
bination ofscx and violence. is the
penultimate act. Erotic pleasure
cannot be separated from culture,
and in our culture, male erotrism
is wedded to power. Not only
should a man be taller and
stronger than a female in the
perfect love-match. but he must
also demonstrate his Sipeior
strength in gesutres of dominance
which are perceived as amorous.
Though the law attempts to make
a clear division between rape and
sexual intercourse, in fact the
courts find it difficult to
distinguish between a case where
the decision to copulate was
mutual and one where a man
forces himself upon his partner.

And if the professional rapist is
