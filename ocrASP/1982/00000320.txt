Inlans. Unfortunately, the Zlonlsls dream of a
“homeland for the Jews" has been turned In-
to a nightmare for their semltic cousins - the
‘Palesllnlans.

The Israelis have effectively forbIdden
U.S. ofﬁcials to meet with any PLO
representative. The Issues here are very
clear. The Zionists are not calling for a
peaceful Jewish state In which the Jews can
live In peace with their Arab neighbors, theIr
old cousins, their blood relatives - the
semlies. Nol They want to reestablish the

r Its/Palestine}

The Palestinians have always refused to
recognlxe Israel. Do you think that I] they
now afﬁrmed Israel 's rlght to exist that Israeli
would return the West Bank or the Gaza
Sirlp?

The Palestinian Charter Is very clear about
what It wants which Is to create a state that
does away with a separate Jewish Identity,
and create what Palestinians call a “secular
democratic state" In Its place. Arafat and hls
colleagues In the PLO Charter do not pro-
vide for or allow for the right of Jews who
came to Palestine before a certain date
(1917 Balfour Declaration). There are alot of
components here about what Mr. Arafat
may say, or not say, and what reallty and
history In fact has shown us.

What is really outraglng Is that this kind of
bombing and killing and mufllatlng and
dlsperslng of the Lebanese and the Palesti-
nlan people has been goIng on for years In
the name of retaliation. Hasn't the ilme
come that the Israelis realize they are 100
pushy? Tell them that the Palesllnlans are
also a fact. No one can or should deny that
fact.

Aspects also spoke to the Executive Director
of the Greater Albany Jewish Federation,
Steven Wlndmueller In Its alfempf to ex-
amine both sides of this dichotomy. Mr.
Wlndmueller recently returned from the
Middle East.

Do you think the American press Is gluing
lhe Issue lair couerage? Some feel they're
IeanIng towards the Palesllnlan slde.

It's not the question of whether they're lean-
Ing towards the PalesiInIan side or io the
Israell side. It Is a question of InIerpreiIon,
and the emphasis given In lhe media 10 Ihls
whole Issue, I feel, raises some very serious
charges of a double standard, so that the
Issues may be reported on, but the weighing
and the Interpretation of those issues 15
where I bellcve there Is a real media crediblll-
ty problem.

May llnler that you belleue that they [caused
on the sensotlonallsm of the massacre and
disregarded the broader Issues?

1 would say that the massacre In a number of
ways proves to be a good example of this
case In polni. First of all. the InItlal reports of
the number kllled were exagerated-I don't In-
tend to belittle the value of human life and
don't believe the loss of human life should be
a case of comparing numbers, but I think
there was a kind of emphasis placed on Israel
as If It were unconcerned about what hap-
pened. Israel Is a democracy and the people
In a democracy respond: the Israelis
responded and I think that In hlnd sight, the
American media almost had to fake a step
lback and swallow what they put forth In the
early stages. I think that the soclely has
responded and I think the administrallon In
Israel has responded to them.

Do you think Israel bears any responsibllliy
for Ihe massacre?

I hope the formal conduct of InquIry wlll
j deiermlne that.

‘Do you ihlnk there Is any way Israel can
‘secure her borders or w!” there always be
upheaval?

I’m an optimist and I ihlnk we saw In ihe
Israel—Egyptlan peace accord at Camp
David. really the first slaps towards an accep-
tance by the largest and most Important of

the Arab slates; It accepted Israels exlsience
and worked out a plan where It would return
terrltory. and that's hopel I Ihlnk that Is the
best example and most positive statement
one can make - that If Ihe other Arab states
could accept or would accept Israel's rlghi to
exist then the same kind of arrangement
could be made In the other situations.

Do you thInk that Israel will be contenl to
wlilidraw lrom Lebanon now?

I think that Issue Is based on whether there Is
a simultaneous withdrawal by Syria from the
Baaka Valley. If the Syrlans and the Palesti-
nlans that remain In the valley withdraw. the
Israelis have said publlcally they would
withdraw. I think It's Just a matter now of
negotlaied resolution.

Do you recognize the Palestinians right to a
homeland?

I personally believe very firmly that the

[Palesllnlans have a right to a home. It's a

great tragedy that for over 34 years the Arab
government and PLO have elected to fake a
,course of non-recognlilon and non-
accepiance of Israel's presence In the region
,and have used war rather than other
peaceful options for solving the problem.
,And have used the refugees. the Palestinian
Irefugees, as a kind of pawn In Ihls game.
'They slt In those. camps lliorugheut the Arab
IWorld as a kind of visible symbol of the Arab
world's unwillingness to even address the
problem and just use It as a polliIcal and
lmllliary kind of tool. It's iraglc: they're play-
llng with human beings who have a place and
a right to be a pnri of ilils greal thing they call
the Middle East. People have forgotten that
In 1947 there was a partition plan which call—
ed for a Palestlnlan entity and a Jewish eniI-
Iy. That's all but forgotten. Everyone wants
to rewrite history and start all over. The
tragedy Is that the Arabs and ihe Jews have
been scarred by all these years of war and
hatred and they have to start building new 

levels‘ of confidence-so Arabs can trust Jews 

 

 



 

and Jews can trust Arabs and so that the
rhetorlc will gIve way to real experlences of
Ivlng and working together. Name calllng-
ierms lIke "genoclde" and “Jews are the new
Nazis" and "Begln Is a new HIiIer" are accen-
luailng and Inienslfylng the problem rather
than bringan about solullons or looking at
the real Issue, which Is secure boarders for
Israel and the right and place for a new
Palestinian community.

Do you think Ilia! the peace keeplng lorce Is
helplng?

I worry about the peace keeping force
because I Ihlnk that what Israel found out to
Its sadness. the peace keepan force wIlI see -
that Lebanon Is a country stlll In formation
and wIih all these factions and anlmosliy bet-
ween groups, peace will be fragile because of
old hostilities. I worry that all of these forces
that go In may not come out sale and secure.
Do you Ihlnk that the BegIn/Sharon gouern~
menI has been loyal to the wishes o/ the
Israel people? Do you Ihlnk that Begln Is a
new “HIIIer”?

I don‘t even ihlnk ihc terms make sense
|because you're Implylng ihai ihere was a
preconceived plan to destroy people and
:Ihal the plan somehow had a pattern. That's
nonsense. The Israeli plan was to remove
Ifrom the northern borders lhe PLO as a
imllliary force. The Israeli posture Is one of
Ihavliig made a delermlnaflon of prolecflng
Ils cIIIzens and once and for all removing ihe
poienilal ihai vlolence will be visited upon
llhem. The people of Israel and historians wlIl
)udge on the merIIs of Israeli policy In lhis
isliuailon. The offlclal conduct of InquIry will
Judge whether there was any complicity or
'lncorrect behavior In the parilcular matter of
iihe massacre, cliher by the mllllary or the
|government. It Is an obscenliy to suggest that
there Is a comparison between the leadership
of Israel and the Nazi war machlne. 1 am per-
sonally offended by the notion of this com-
parislon because I belleve It is an effort: to
Lemotlonallze the situation and to put the
Jews and Israel In a very defensive corner. I
.thlnk It's a crude effort of raclsi strategy to
’somehow develop a different premise for the
'Jews and Israel than for the rest of the world.
Do you thlnk people are using the situation
.as a vehicle to further antl-semlusm?

ji ihlnk that there Is a kInd of bias, hatred. and
raclsm ihere to emote or create an envlron-
men! of anti-Jewish feellng.

 

The need for roots Is someihlng we all
[share and even wIthn these clear cul posl-
|Ilons there would still seemingly be room for
understandan and compromise. The plight
Vol the Palesflnlan people Is a grave one. but
no less than the Israel position that demands
[safety for her people that live In the border
iareas. The Palesilnlans have consistenin
lrefused to recognize Israel's right to exist
Iwhile Israel has taken a defenslve stand that
,would seem to ellmlnate the West Bank or
,Gaza Strip as potential homelands for this

|losi race.

I The "Holy Land", the homeland of
,easiern and western rellglon alike Is steeped
In a history of blood. We can all only hope
that the bloodshed wlIl come to an end. and
all the children who have grown up under
the pail of war will Iknow Peace In a land
‘Ihey |can call their own.
