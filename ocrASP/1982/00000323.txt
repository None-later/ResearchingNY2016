Redecorated Patroon Room serving in style

“aethctlc” improvement. Hynes
'says the room has become more
Center. said Lester Hyncs. UAS functional and efﬁcient. Some [7
Campus Center Food Service Direc- new tables were added. increasing,
tor. sit-down capacity in the room.

The Patroon Room furniture was
nearing the end of its useful lifeI ac-
cording to Hynes. The tables and
chairs arc now being used in the
Kumquat. the dining hall on Alum-
ni Quad.

Hyncs estimated the ﬁnal cost of
the renovation to be between
585.000 and 390.000. The money.
he said. was taken from UAS funds
set aside for renewals and
replacements. and the project is
part of ongoing SUNYA im-
provcmcnts.

Along with

~wcrc impressed with

. and open atmosphere.
To complement the new interior,
the new lunch menu has been im-
proved. Hyncs said. it now offers
such dishes as “Shrimp Florentine”
and a “Fettucinc Du Chef."
Lunchtime business has been im-
proving. Hyncs observed. The hard
data is not in yet. he says. “but
from the fch of things business is
up around 25 percent." He says this
increase is similar to the increase
that happened after the food service
renovations downstairs in the cam-

. employee says this is because the
prices are less expensive than retail
restaurants. which adds to the
room's popularity.

Besides the lunch business. the
room averages about 3 parties a
week. Hyncs said.Univcrsity groups
can hold affairs in the room and
have UAS serve up such dishes as
Beef Burgandy. Picmontsise or

Roast Duckling with orange sauce.
