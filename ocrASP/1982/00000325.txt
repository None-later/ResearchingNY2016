Netters lose second straight

 

By Randy Roth

A struggling Albany State women's tennis team
returned to action Wednesday only to suffer their sc-
cond consecutive sctback. losing decisively by a 5.2
score to visiting Union College. On Saturday the
Danes had also cxpcricnccd defeat. on that occasion
by a score of 6-0 against Vermont.

Albany coach Jim Scrbalik prcdlctably was not very
happy about the outcome of either match. “I was not
very pleased.“ he said. “We did not play chI at all."

The Union match certainly served as a case in point.
Many of the Danes appcarcd rather sluggish and their
play was lackluster at best. with the exception of
singles players Sandra Burrcllc and Ellen Yun. Bar-
rclle. assigned to the third singles spot. easily dcfcatcd
her opponent. Union’s Rita Lindcnburg. by identical
6-4 scorcs. As far as a confident Barrcllc was concern-
ed the result was never in doubt.

“I played very well and moved the ball around cx-
actly like I wanted to." she said. “It wasn't a tough
match and I never felt Illrctttcncd.”

Coach Scrbalik had nothing but prunisc for llarrcllc.
“Sandra has bccn playing vcry wcll lately and it show-
ed today." he said.

ElIcn Yun. Albany’s othcr victor. was involvcd in
the longest match of the afternoon with Union's Alissa
Calabria. Yun prcvailcd in the thrcc-sct affair by
scores of 6-4.4-6.6-2.

"Ellen‘s making tremendous slridcs." Conch Scr-
bulik obscrvcd. “If she can continue to bc patient and
hit consistent ground strokes from the baseline she will
be very successful.“

Besides Yun and llarrcllc though. none of the Danes
were able to win a match. Albany lost three of the five
singles, and both doubles. Barrcllc attributed hcr
tcrun's overall performance to thc fact that they
rcgardcd the wcakcr Union team too lightly. “Wc
underestimated them." she said later, “and that hurt
us a lot."

The Eastern Collegiatcs will be Itcld today thru Sun-
day in Binghamton with the top players from teams in
the East meeting to compete. Joan Phillips is slated to
represent Albany in singles play while llarrcllc and

“This was a big will for us. and I fccl that this is the
tttning point in our season. I think we can really turn
things around now." said women’s cross country
conch Ron White. referring to Wednesday's mcct in
which the Danes dct'cntcd Hartwick Collcgc, 21-36.

McCarthy look the lcud at the one-mile mark and
never lookcd back running away from the pack. White
was also impressed by thc pcrformttncc of Kim l’ntch.
who knocked off about two minutes from hcr tiruc on
the same course last year.

“If things go right, our monicntutn continues and
we're free of injuries. we can really finish with the bcst
