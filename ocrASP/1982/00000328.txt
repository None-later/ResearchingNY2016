Preparation

. and prevention

are mainstays
against stress

By Mark Gesner

Each person who experiences an
emotional problem has a different
method of finding relief. Some
people rely on inner strength. others
call on friends for aid. while still
others seek outside or professional
assistance. Often. the latter scents

Roots

This coiumtt will
try and relate to
you what some of the views are on
common psychological issues facing
today's student. You might
discover that yott are neither alone
or "weird" in your feelings and
anxieties. The articles also inelttde
a list of agencies that you cart refer
to Willi arty further questions.

Topics such as stress. anorexia.
alcoholism and drug issues, and
human sexuality concerns are some
ideas that are currently being ex-
plored by Middle Earth Roots.
This is an idea stemming from the
work of Middle Earth's Outreach
(.‘oordiuator. Dave Miller.

Any ideas or suggestions that you
would like to see in the column may
be placed in the news box located at
the ASP office. Campus Center
32‘).

Stress. The mere mention of the
word can give you a tension
headache. However. it's itnportant
to realize that stress is not always a
negative or unhealthy part of ottr
life. According to a pamphlet en-
titled Redrtcing Strident Stress Ex-
periences: A Training Manual by
Bad and Betcc. it is at the point
when a situation creates an un-
manageable amount of stressful
feelings that the stress becomes
“distress”. and has a detrimental
effect on our norrttal life style.

University students are especially
vulnerable to distressful situations.
in addition to dealing with adult-
typc problems. they must also at-
tempt to adjust anti succeed iii the
competitive world of academia.
The dating or non-dating scene.
along with experiencing the first ex-
aru of the semester, are two major
causes of student stress that the
pamphlet describes as common for
the October rnontit.

Bad and Betee explain that tile
best way to deal with stress involves
preparatiott and prevention. The
latter suggests that we should never
ignore what our bodies tell us. if
you feel that you're in a tense state.
stop. listen to that message. and
rest.

The other mainstay in dealing
with stress is through preparation.
“1 think a lot of it is to attain great
personal insight. To take a step
backward and assess what issues
and concerns that predominate
one's daily experience. To work on
these issues one at a time," said
Middle Earth outreach coordinator.
Dave Miller.

Essentially. preparation comes in
the form of time management.
Although everyone has the some
amount of time each week, some
people can manage a corporation
while others have problems simply
getting schoolwork done.

A Middle Earth tape on How to
Handle Stress explains that the
secret lies not in working harder or
longer, bill in working better. it's
quality. not quantity. that should

be onc's goal. Concentrate on do-
ing the right thing rather titan doing
things right. The difference is being

 

effective - not just efﬁcient. Effl-
cicncy is good. although it's merely
an end in itself.

A tape on Time Management ex-
plains that in order to start manag-
ing time more effectively you must
first know how it is presently being
spent. This may be accomplished
by keeping a log of your activities
for a span of three days. Next you
can look at what yotr did and how
long it took to do it. The
knowledge should help in prioritiz-
ing, eliminating. simplifying and
combining your activities.

Miller explained time manage-
ment as. “seeing the environment
or behaviors that distract you from
what you want to do. Work on
lrow to put those distractions in a
more manageable framework."

included among those distrac-
tions or "time wasters" are doing
tasks unrelated to goals. giving
routine matters too nutch impor-
tance. and letting yourself be inter-
rttpted (Being able to say no to in-
terruptions is an important skill to
master).

if all else fails - just try to relax.
The Titne Management tape stig-
gests that doing something
"selfish" might help. Some people
read. fun. nap. or play the piano.
Discover what makes you happy
and what relieves your particular
level of stress.
