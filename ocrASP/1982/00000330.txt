Polling place

<Front Page
ctions.

Previously. students in the ISIh
ward voted at St. Margaret Mary‘s
School. off of Westertt Ave, which
is a "considerable" distance.

"In tlte 198l general election
tltere was a very low voter turn out,
and we believe this was due to the
inaccessibility of the polling place,"
Corso said.

Neil Brown. Dean of Stttdcnt Af-
fairs, said the university administra-
tion supports SA. and is committed
to finding a space on cttmptts for a
polling place. If It is set up on catn-
pus. it will effect only students
residing on State. Colortial and
Alumni Quads. Residents of Dutch
attd Indian Quads ttrc not part of
the ISth ward and wouch still .vote
in the (iuildcrland District.

SA lttts beett ttctive in promoting
sludeuts' right to vote. not only in
this case. but itt last year's suit filed
by SASU and NYI’IRG which end-
ed in students getting the right to
vote itt their college communities.

(‘orsott said that iI' satisfactory
response is not made by the lloard
of Elections, legal ttctiott tttay be
taken. ‘

tlettt last year. Acton denied this.
saying he didn't tltittk that
Kocthctt's tetttatks would he
"received with such credibility."
Loomis. however. handled the ac-
tual case in court. attd also men-
tioned Koethen's “very :tccusitory“
letters accusing him of lying. Ill ad-
Llitintt, Koetlten protested Universi-
ty President ()‘l.cary‘s lack of ac»
tion itt investigating the ease. I 1

According to Vice President for
University Affairs Lewis Welch.
who handled Kocthen‘s complaint,
the Center is a private corporation
with its own board of directors.

Although an agreement allows the
Center to occupy space in I’icrccr
I-lall‘s lower level In rctttrn for
special services to the University
Community, SUNYA holds no

 

supervisory powers over its actions.
Recently. Koethen received a
form letter from the Commission
on Judicial Conduct. stating that
they. too. could do nothing.
Koethen now says he plans to go
through Albany's Dispute Media-
tion Program in order to reach a
decision which he can bring back to
court in another attempt at his
case. '

State Quad briefly blackened
by breaker trip for second time in week

By Matt Nichols

State Quad residents suffered
another power failure at ll p.tn.
Sunday.

The blackout. which lasted for
eight minutes. was caused by tile
tnain breaker automatically swit-
eItittg off. The same reason was
cited for last 'l‘hut'sday's I'iI'Iecn
minute blackout.

Shop Coordinator at the Physical
Plant. .ioe I’m. said he wasn't sure
of what caused tltc breaker to
switch off. but he believes that it

 

 

was probably a simple power
overload. "We have increased the
voltage litnit on the breaker to a set-
ting that General Electric believes
safe." said Fox.

This past summer when physical
plant workers tested the main
breaker with machines. they
discovered It was inoperative.
Although repairmen fixed the
breaker, itt light of the two reccrtt
blackouts, I-‘ox thinks that State
()uad‘s power will have to be shut
dowtt temporarily itt order to retest
the breaker. l l

Rape rally

<Front Page

tion is the fragility of the evidence
of rape, and the fact that the onus
of proof Is on the prosecution.
Because sexual crimes are con-
sidered crimes against the state. the
District Attorney decides which of
the reported cases he will bring to
trial. Condo said that rape is also
one of the most highly repeated
crimes because no attempt is made
to rehabilitate rapists. She said that
once the_ criminal is freed from
prison. usually 8 to Is years later.
he is free to repeat the crime.

The downtown rally and march
was organized over the last six
weeks by Debbie Schramek and
Laurie Novak of the Albany Coun-
ty Rape Crisis Center representing
Supportive Citi/ens Against Rape

(SCAR) with endorsements from
