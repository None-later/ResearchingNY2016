an excellent breaking up. the at-
tempted pass.

Dutchmen ﬁrst-year head coach
AI Bagnoli elected to go for the
22-yard ﬁeld goal on fourth down.
However, place kicker Mark
McKelvcy slipped as he was about
to boot the ball and Albany
recovered the loose ball on_ their

    

own 20 yardline.

“The closer we got to our goal
line. the easier it was to pass dc-
fend." said Albany State head
coach Bob Ford, noting his team's
strong goal line defense. "You
don't have a lot of end zone."

The Danes looked to immediately
capitalize on the Union mishap. In
the two previous games this season,

Quarterback Tom Pratt only had 89 yards passing against Union with
Albany going to the ground game.

WOLF ROAD. NEXT TO HERMAN'S

Albany relied mainly on the pass to .

move the ball downﬁeld. Not so
against Union. however, as the
Danes began to open up their
ground game. '

Sophomore fullback Pat Har-
rison scampered for ﬁve yards to
get the Danes moving. By game's
end, Harrison had enjoyed his
finest afternoon as a Dane with 99
yards on IS carries.

“The line did a great job," said a
modest Harrison. "We‘ve been try-
ing to pass more and I'm trying to

stabilize it with my running game.

A quarterback keep, two con-
secutive gives to Harrison and a fine
juggling reception by tight end Jay
Ennis brought the ball near mid-
field.

After Harrison carried the hall
for four more yards, Ford called for
Albany‘s patented split-end reverse
option pass play. It had worked the
week before against Brockport
when Pete Marlo looked for Ennis
near the end zone and Ennis was in»
terfaced with. This time the cast of
characters remained the same.
Marlo came around took the han-
doff and saw Ennis in the clear 32
yards down field.

Two plays later Pratt hit Dave

Soldini for seven yards and an
' Albany touchdown. Albany tried a
two-point conversion but that failed
leaving them with the early 6-0 lead.

The Danes added to that lead
later in the second half. Starting on
their own 24 yard line. Albany let
their backfield do the work as Har-
rison and Dunham. who had 63
yards on the day, continued to eat
up yardage. But the big play ofthc
drive was a controversial 38—yard
reception by wide receiver Bob
Brien. It was ruled that Brien had
possession of the ball as he went out
of bounds on the Union 35

This time. however, the Danes
failed to get the touchdown and had
to settle for Torn Lincoln's 23-yard
field goal. Albany led 9-().

Albany increased that lead to l7-0
early in the second half. With the
hall on the Union 26 yard line. Ford
called his patented play again and it
worked again. Marlo hit Ennis
wide open deep and the tight end
raced into the end tone.

“The first time we saw that they
were not prepared for it." said
Marlo who finished the day with 68
passing yards. "There was no one
in front of me; I was wide open and
Jay was wide open. I looked up. I

saw Jay and twice I had him."

0n the double success of that one
play Ford said; "Sometimes you
can lull people to sleep. I was think-
ing of using it a third time.

A two-point conversion closed
the scoring for Albany. Midway
through the fourth quarter Union
struck back. A Bob Bertagna in-
terception gave the Dutchmen the
ball on their own l8 year line.
Steward led his team down ﬁeld
with a passing exhibition hitting
eight complete passes along the
way. The final one gave the Dut-
ehmert their ﬁrst points of the game
as Stewart hit Rich Kellahcr in the
end tone with 8:14 left to play. The
point after was good and the Dut-
chmen chalked up their first seven
points.

For the Danes, it was not one o." ‘

their more dominating wins this
season. A strong Union defense
forced Albany more to the ground
away from the wide open style they
had shown against Brockport and
Ithaca.

"They have a very good pass
defense. When coach Ford saw
that, he stuck to the ground."said
Dunham. “It was tough yardage to
get but it got the job done."
