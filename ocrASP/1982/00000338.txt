riers still exist that hinder educational and
physical access for handicapped students on
campus. said Nancy Belowich. coordinator
of the Disabled Student Services program.

While federal legislation prohibits the
denial of public education to the handicap-
ped, the struggle to aid tltetn continues.

Approximately 100 students are now at-
tending SUNYA. with many of them living
on State Quad. Most of these students ex-
perience difficulty in tnobillty and sight,
Beiowich said.

State Quad. specially adapted for the
handicapped. has 19 rooms designed to
facilitate wheelchair-bound students. attd
l0 rooms reserved for their attendants.
Each rootn includes modified showers.
toilets and sinks, as well as special door-
ways.

ped students. The Public Safety Depart-
ment also mentioned new wheel chair
ramps and more handicapped parking
spaces. , ‘

Other changes include improved access
to educational buildings. new telephones
and water fountains. a ramp to the podium
fountain. a lift to allow students to swim in
the gym and pool. and modification of
Camp Dippikill.

“Albany began coming accessible before
any SUNY school, and they have not ab-
dicated their responsibility since the school
began its program." Belowieh claimed.

Special programs at SUNYA. funded in
part by SA. ltave developed extensively over
the last few years. The Student Services
Center has referred attendants. hired
readers, note takers and tapers of the deaf
and blind.

Often a student with a hidden learning
disability is misdiagnosed or overlooked - a
"major obstacle" to greater understanding
of the handicapped. said liclowich.

“Left undiagnosed arid untreated there is
an ttttcr waste to society and human poten-
tial." said llelowieh. “We need an at-
titudinal change. a majority of disabled

- students don't necessarily exhibit them

(disabilities). it is important to promote
awareness that support is available."

in order to ltelp erase ccrtuitt barriers to
learning; the eight-year-old Disabled Stu-
dent Service has. in conjunction with the

dictionaries and large-print copies of the
New York Times are available. and the
room is staffed with a special librarian.

SA has contributed funds which led to
the formation of u wlteelchair basketball
team and the purchase of u specittl van to
transport the handicapped throughout the
community.

However, federal aid cutbacks are taking
their toll on the program, Belowieh warn-
cd. Reagan's recommended elimination of
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.
which grants students aid, has woried litany
cottccrned with protecting the special needs

of the handicapped.

Among Reagan's proposed changes are
"tests and assessments of students poten-
tial contribution to society," changes in ad-
missions policy uml removal of adopted
facility construction requirements in the
fu t u r e .

Although Governor Carey has allocated
$20,(X)0 for building modifications enabling
sortie new structural changes to take place.
Belowich stressed that “modifications are
still needed in order to have total architec-
tural accessibility uttd make the campus a
totally comfortable environment for han-
dicapped students."

Merritt added.

A significant number of alumni
defined themselves as racists. sexists
-— and generally wealthy.

Only 36 percent of the Princeto-
niaus. for instance. say they believe
black people are as intelligent as
whites. Forty-seven percent of the
Yale ulutnni and 55 percent of the
Harvard alumni judged the races in-

Seventy-three percent of the
l’rincetottlnns agreed men and
women are equally itttelligent. but.
again, more Yale and Harvard
grads -- 86 percent of them -- prov-
ed to be liberal on the question.

Nearly half of the Princeton nttd
Yale alumni endorsed
Reagunomics. while Harvard's
 - class. with twice the number of
registered Democrats. overwhelm-
ingly (64-36 percent) rejected
Rengauomics.

Most of the survey covered ques-
tions concerning topics like book
reading, but tltct responses to
I political attd social questions have

generated the roost lteut.

“it's kind of u worst-cuse
