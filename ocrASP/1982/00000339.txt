Two new books

By David Gaede
....... ,_f;'i’.‘f‘;”~'_”’l=“'5-"E"W'E V“
Providence. RI

The escalating cost of going to
college has raised student stress
levels. intensified competition for
aid. sparked a hrrge migration from
private to cheaper public colleges
and. finally. produced something
brand new.

The evcr-rnorc-spccittlized stu-
dent grride to choosing a college.
and then getting the most for the
student‘s ruorrey from it. The once-
exclusivc domain of llarron's. Col-
lege Board, Lovcjoy's and Peter-
son‘s guides to colleges -- known as
the Big Four in college directory
circles -- was invaded earlier in 1982
by a couple of irreverent. subjective
entries.

Now students at two universities
are writing grridcs for certain kinds
of students.

This fall. Everywmnun's Guide
to Colleges and Universities and
Tire Black Student's Guide lo Col-
leges will debut at bookstores.

They are markedly different from
the Big Four -- which drin offer
reams of studiedly objective infor-
mation on thousands ofeampuscs --
and the Yale Insider ‘5 Guide to Col-
leges and the New York Times’
Selective Guide Io Colleges and
Universities —- which may poke fun
at a school's quality of teaching.
criticize dull social scenes. say bad
things about curricula. or even say
if it‘s safe to eat in the cafeterias.

“We just felt there was a need for
a no-nonsense grridc for black
students." said Barry Ilcckham. the
Brown University professor who is
editing the li/ru'lr Student's Guide.
“A black sttrdcnt trying to decide
on a college could have no idea
about the cmitotnnclll, tone and
emotions of a campus from the
traditional collcgc guide.“ The
Iz'i‘r'rvwonlu/I'.\ (liar/e is also “a
\ct) scrions gunlc. filled with
slraighttorwar'd information.“ said
Arlene \\'inniclt of the I‘s‘tttitlisl
Press. which publishes the book
from the State llniscrsity ol New
York-(lid \\"estbury.

liolh ac“ guides uscd a combina-
tion of questionaircs and essays to
compile their information.

llcckharn and student interns ask»
ed schools across the country aborrt
the ruunbcr of black students and
facility mernbcrs they had. special
minority sludcul assistance pro-
grants. and black student social life.

lilack students at each of the
schools also wrote essays. llcckhanr
said. to give potential cnrollccs an
idea of the “general academic and
social climate toward blacks."

“We‘re riot trying to be cute." he
said. “We're trying to be helpful.
He even scrapped the idea of rank»
ing the top ten schools because we
felt it would detract from the real
purpose of the book."

Eve/jvwonmn's editors .scnt ques-
tionaircs to over 3000 colleges to
gather the information for the 582
listings in the book. Winnick said.

Each listing discusses such things
as the percentage of women
graduating in "non-lradilional"
majors, women's programs. the
number of female athletes. the
guality of campus security. as well
as information on special programs
anti organizations for women.

“When you list all tilesc things
together." Winnick said. "you
come up with an atlitrrdc of how a
campus feels about women. We

thing it will answer a lot of ques-
tions that today's women are ask-

 

 

 

 

 

ng, or should be asking."

The editors are counting on the
high cost of college to make the
guides successful. figuring people
will want more help in choosing a
college and spending a lot of money

on it. A similar impulse had other
observers expecting a future full of

special guides to women's colleges,
colleges with extensive evening pro-
grams. junior collcgcs and rnayhe
even a gay students' guide I 1

OCTOBER 8, (9821!: ALBANY STUDENT PRESS 7

New York
(N’) The upcoming Black Student's
Guide to Colleges has favorable
opinions on many New York State
schools. although it takes jabs at
some of the more elite institrrtions.

The State University of New
York at Albany has good academic
variety bill the book says rnaay
blacks students are apathetic and do
not participate in programs
organircd by black groups.

One student reported racial con-
flicts in dormitories at the State
University of New York at Buffalo
and others said the white faculty
and administrators there were “un-
caring. strict and very impatient".

Good words are heaped upon
chssclacr Polytechnic Institute in
Troy. The school has a broad range
of efforts to launch minority
students into engineering careers
and fins good relations between
blacks and whites. the book says.

Vassar in l’oughkeepsie may he

sisters colleges," but black students

said it was a difficult place for them
to adjust. ’

“They suggest that real
understanding may be as scarce
among left-wing Liberals as it is
among Conservatives." the book
advises.

The book says Cornell University
in Ithaca. “lacks the expected
number of black students" for a
school of its size and stature. but
that those who do'attend get quality
services. The lvy League school is
very competitive and. according to
one student. minority students who
take advantage of the special pro-
grams for them have a stigma that is
difficult to overcome.

The book praises the curriculum
at Columbia College but shys that
the Ivy League school's "four black
faculty members do not have
enough time for the many students
who need their assistance." The
students interviewed had high
praise for their academic experience
at Columbia, L]
