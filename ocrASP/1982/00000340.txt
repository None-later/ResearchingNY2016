A college professor who com-
parcd I£.T. with Jesus is itt trouble--
not witlt arty religious leaders. but
with Universal Studios. The film

tltc giant studio's “lay off" warn-

Canine wanted

After five years on Broadway.
the producers of the musical “An-
nic" are retiring Sandy the Dog.
and the search is on for a new
canine star. The new dog for “An-
nic Two" must have the same wire-
haircd coat. browrt eyes and
"airplane" cars as his predecessor.
And don't count on getting rich if

“Sandy” was adopted from a
pound for eight bucks.

Flying carpet

Physics will soon bring you...l‘ly-
ing carpets. That's the word from
Stanford Professor William Little.
who says he's crcatcd rm airborne
rug. Little passed a carpet through a
magnetic field. supercooled it. turn-
ed on the cttrrcrtt and...prcsto. the
carpet rose ittto the air. The
physicist predicts that in tire future.
travelers will ride on trains that
lloat on a magnetic field attd reach
speeds over 3-hundrcd miles per

Spot goes network

Spot. tltc Wonder Dog. in

' longtime fixture on public televi-

sion's “Sneak Previews" movie
review. has joined hosts Roger
Ebert and Gene Siskcl in switching
to commercial broadcasting. Spot.
who was fired frorn the PBS show
in a dispute over money. has signed
a contract to appear with Ebert and
Siskel in their new network show.
“At the Movies."

Role reversal

Phil Donahue is famous for put-
ting people on the spot. btrt now
he's irt something of a light one
himself. The talk show host has
been hit with a ten-million-doilar
lawsuit by a Denver woman. She
claims Donahue refused to reveal

ltcr cx‘husband‘s whereabouts after
he appeared on Donahtte's show to
talk about how ltc had taken his son
away from home when his wife was
awarded custody. Tltc cx-wifc is
charging Donahue with violation of
child custody arid conspiracy. as
well as mental anguish.

 

Cheap detectives

Watch out Magnum: The cost of
hiring at private cyc has gone down.
That's because a California \\u|llil|l
has opened the first cut-rate dclce»
tivc agency. calledunatttrttlly--”‘I’lte
Cheap Detective." Deanna Short
says her service is based on the same
principles as a fast-food outlet: gite
people what they want fast am] in-
expensively. Cheap Detectitc
charges I0-i5 dollars art hour for
gtunshoe work. compared with the
35 bucks most agcrtcics charge. To

company car. Called the
“llolmcsntobilc.“ tltc 197i

Big withdrawal

Stanton Powers says lte wasn‘t
surprised when art automated teller

gone from a dollar-seventeen to

was an act of (iod. littt the County

torney. Marcello l)imattro. adding
that lie doesn‘t see ltow his client
cart be charged with anything but

Bad heat

With witttcr just around the cor-
rtcr. about 5-million people are c\-
pccted to buy kerosene heaters this
year. But. while they‘re a popular
tray to save money on energy bills.
C‘orrtrrmer Reports says kerosene
heaters pose a tltrcatuindoonair
polltrtion. The ntttga/inc‘s engineer's
evaluated lit different models. and.
according to a spokesman. “what
we learned gives us great concern
about the widespread use of
kerosene ltcutct's." According to

unsatisfactory levels of carbon
dioxide. Although pollutant levels
can be cut down by opening a win-
dow. that reduces the heatcr's eff-
ciency. To avoid such hazards. the
magazine advices consumers to pur-
chase portable electric heaters in-
stead.

Avocado woofs

An oversupply of avocados is
paying off for man's best friend.
Atlcrtst one pet-food company.
Breeder's Choice. is lest-marketing
tut utocado dog food. And. accor-
ding to company president Herold
lttytor, "it seems to be working--
people who have been using it have
been rcpcat buyers." The idea ﬁrst
surfaced among members of the
California avocado commission last
January. when one grower claimed,
"he never seen a dog that
wouldn't eat an avocado." Others.
however. feared using avocados in
dog food would dcmcan their image
as a human delicacy.

 

Stealing the plate

Somebody in St. Louis thinks he
has a license to steal-~and from the
police. no less. One night a few
weeks ago. nine squad cars in the ct-
l)“s western subttrbs wee relieved of
their official police plates. The cops
are at a loss to explain the thefts.
but have promised that the culprit.
it' apprehended. will be given an ins
tcnsive course in license-plate melt-
itrg...at the state prison.
