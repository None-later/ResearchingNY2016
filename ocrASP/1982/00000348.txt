Forsch. who is thc scttior member
of this Cardinal club. was brilliant.
mowing thc Braves down. striking
out six whilc walking nine. and pro-
tccling an curly onc-run Icad built
on the blazing speed of rookie
Willie Mchc. The pitcher. who
retired the last II batters in a row.
also contributed a sacriﬁce Iiy in a
five-run St. Louis rally in the sixth
that wrapped tip the victory. and
scored in the cighth inning after his
.sccond single of the game.

Atlanta will try to cvcn the series
Friday night with 43-year-old
knucklcballcr l’hil Nickro coming
back after pitching 4 l-3 innings in
