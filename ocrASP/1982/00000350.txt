ocmeaa 8. 1982 a ALBANY STUDENTPRESS spans 17

Men booters droo below .500 after Union defeat

 

By Marc Schwartz
smrr warren

The Albany State men's soccer team's
record dropped to below the .500 mark for
the ﬁrst time this season with their 2-0 loss
to Union, Wednesday night at Union.

The Danes, who have not won in two

weeks, did everything right except score,
according to Albany Coach Bill Schieffelin.
Albany's record is rtow 2-3-2, and they are
OJ-I since their hard fought win over Platt-
sburgh on September 22.

“it was a grime in which nothing much
happened.” said Schieffelin. The Dut-
chmcn's first goal was scored at 76:l9 on a
shot from forward Stegcrnann. Union add-
cd an Insurance goal with l:36 left in the
game. Both offenses were ineffective as the
Danes managed only six shots forcing
goalie Harrlss to make only one save.
Union ltad five shots on goalie Tom Mer-
ritt. Merritt made four saves, in what
Schleffelln termed “a ﬁne performance."

if there have been two constants to the
Dancs’ season so far, it has been the play of
Michael Miller and Jerry lsaacs and the in-
effectiveness of Albany's offense. Schicf-
felln again, had nothing but praise for
Miller and lsaacs. Miller, a transfer from
Rockland Community College is all over
the ﬁeld on defense. The long legs on his
6‘5" body enable him to roam the entire
width of the ﬁeld clearing potentially

 

dangerous balls from the Dane end. lsaacs.
considered to be a legitimate All-American
candidate, is the Dane playmaker. lsaacs'
has been involved in three of the last four
goals scored by the Danes.

Unfortunately, those four goals have

now," said Schleffelin. 'We're like it We're not taking the game to the other

, team at the right time. We are not being ag-
gressive or assertive." he continued.
"We're playing hard, but not collectively
hard."

The key, Schlcffelln feels is in the mid-
field. Albany's offense begins with their
midﬁeld play. “Jerry (lsaacs) has been do-
ing the right thing, the rest of the guys have
to start doing the right thing at the right
time,‘ said Schlcffelin. "We're not being
constructive out there."

Despite the recent performances by the
Danes, Schieffelin is still optimistic about
the Danes season. ‘1 would be very surpris-
ed if we finished under .500. l'm looking
for a winning season from these guys. They
are young (only two seniors) and haven't
played together for long. We need time to
gel as a team, but we will."

Schicffclin looks at a NCAA Division lll
playoff spot as "icing on the cake." “There
are only four spots in New York and there
are a lot of very good teams fighting for it,"
he said.
