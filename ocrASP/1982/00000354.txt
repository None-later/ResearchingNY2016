By Mark Gesner
At nineteen Jenny feels it's about titnc
that she have complete charge over her life.
She decides that through extensive dieting
her goal of that control can be reached. Yet
after many weeks of nearly starving herself.
.lcnny still sees a fat person .
standing in front of the 
rttirror. At a height of 5 
feet 5 inches and a weight

of 80 pounds. Jenny is af- 
flictcd with anorexia nervosa.

Jenny is u ficticious character. but her
personality disorder. anorexia nervosa.
is very real. it is it disease where emotional
problems are dealt with by means of self-
sluthlllOll. According to psychotherapist
tiuil George. the sufferers of this illness can
lose tnore than 25 percent of their original
body weight. George said 90 percent of the
discs involve females who range itt age from
ll to 25 years.

in order to cure an individqu with
anorexia. it is crucial to understand the
psychology behind the disease. “There is a
great deal of discipline involved in denying
yourself treats and foods which are very
satisfying." commented George.

.An anorexia sufferer gets satisfaction
from their self-denial program. And in ac-
tuality wisdom is involved in their extreme
approach.

George said that. “they are trying to get
control of their life by simplifying the world
around them. and they think that they‘re
hurting no one else in the process."

George. a specialist in the field of anorex-
ia. stresses the great similarity between the
psyches of anorexia sufferers and Olympic
athletes. Both push their bodies to the ex-
tent of pain in order to prove to themselves
and others that there exists something that
they can excel in. Both muke "training" the
center focus of their lives. and receive
satisfaction from that dedication.

l-lowcver. there is one crucial difference
between the athlete and the individual with
anorexia. “The person with anorexia ncr-
vosa does it alone. There is no one there to
tell them that they have gone far enough.
The person is on a good course. but there is
no coach around to respect what they are
doing and to say stop." explained George.

The frequency of anorexia among
women stems from society's emphasis on
looking thin. Advertisements suggest that
one way to gain self esteem is to be slender.

"Society tends not to look deeper than
just a pretty face.” said Elissa Kane. co-
facilituter of the Introduction to Feminism
course taught at SUNYA. "How can a
woman feel good about herself when the
media continues to portray the ideal woman
as thin and sexy? in our society women are
defined in terms of beauty while men are

deﬁned in terms of intelligence."

Student Health Service Director. Dr
Janet Hood said she has seen a rise in the
number of her anorexia patients. "I don't
see” why we are seeing more of it in the past
few years - but we definitely have been."
she said. '

If a potential anorexia case is brought to
the school‘s infirmary. a complete physical

 

 

 

 

 

If an

examination is administered. "This can be a
life threatening problem." said Hood.
After the physical examination a patient
will usually first be sent to the Health Ser-
vice's infirmary psychiatrist. Dr. Richard

' Fclch. "Anyone that has an organic pro-

hlem we send to Dr. Feleh." Hood explain-
ed.

if you think that you are suffering from
anorexia nervosa. there are many places to
seek help. Perhaps the most specialized aid
can come frotn self-help groups run by
George and her group members. Free
meetings are held each second Tuesday of
the month at 53 Dove Street between 7:30
and 9:30 pan. The October meeting is
tonight. More information on this and
other self-help groups can be obtained by
calling 434-4561.

The following is a list of other sources
you may refer to in dealing with anorexia
nervosn: Psychotherapist Gail George
(434-4561); Capital District Psychiatric
Center (445-6601); University Councillng
Service (457-8652); and the Middle Earth
Hotline (457-7800).
