Women booters nail two triumphs

 

By Howard Beech

Sitting behind lter desk. the women’s varsity soccer
coach, Anty Kidder. scented confident in lter learn.
“We're a real young learn. but we're starting to put
things together. Soccer's come a long way here. and
the talent pool is rnttclt greater."

The women are off to an auspicious start this year.
With five wins against orte loss and a tie. the young in-
experienced Danes are pttttirtg the pieces together. A
reasonable explanation is Coach Kidder. "0h. she‘s
real good out there. there's total communication bet-
ween her and the players," Cathy Russo. Dane mid-

fielder and goalie strid. "Artd we're gonna do it!"

On a cold. rain-filled day. the worrrart hooters wcrtt
to St. Lawrence, Wlterr asked aborrt the possible case
of tire game due to last years 4-] Albany victory, the
coach replied, “There are no picnics down the line.
They're all touglt ones."

With Lori Cohen irt goal, for the first time, rnakirtg
14 saves, the Dattes scored a 3-1 victory. The first goal
came at 12 minutes of the first half. Alice Andrews
shot a ball wltich rebounded off of St. Lawrence's
goalkeeper and was put home by Dana Starrt. The 27
minute mark of the half belonged to the Danes also.
Dee Marfc scored on an excellent shot to the left col-
rter of the rrcl.

“It was a phenomenal goal. She ltad to prtt it in at a
very awkward angle. The ball came from the right side,
she was flat to the goal, and I just don‘t know how she
ptrt it in," art enthusiastic Kidder added.

The first ball during which the Danes weren‘t mark»
irrg well at all. ended with Albarty up 2:0

“in the first half. we were letting tlrctrt win the ball,
and we ltad to wirt it back from tlterrt. l‘hcy \\L‘I'C just a
lot nrorc agr'cssivc than us."

The second half was quiet until the 4| rrtirrrrte mark,
when St. Lawrence scored their only goal. The goal
was controversial though. Lori Cohen, the Dane
goalkeeper turd co-captairr disagreed with tltc referee's
call. "The hall has to he totally over the goal line, artd
it wasn't. it was only half was over. It was a very cheap
goal."

The game progressed and the Dane defense got
stronger. Their control gatttc began to take over as
midfielders Russo and Lisa France helped
solidify tlte young inexperienced squad. “We surprised
ourselves," Russo said, who also had t4 saves irt goal
in the booter‘s triumph over LeMoyrte last Tuesday.
The final nail irt the coffin came when Sharon Wheeler

scored on an assist from Marfe.‘

Togetltcrttcs‘s, spirit. and depth are three mcas head
coach Ron White sees blossoming within his women‘s
cross-country tcarrr.

White is hopeful tltat his squad "will keep things in
the winning column" after taking a dtral mcct trorrr
RH and Vassar, wall-74 on Saturday. llreir record
now stands 4-4-1 after gaining their fourth straight vic-
tory. The Albany team was led once again by titllsltttta
ding freshman runner Kathy McCarthy, who lrrrrted irt
a tintc of 18:51.2. Sophomore Siobhan Griffin was
clocked at 19:13.0. a personal best time for the coursc.
Griffin said that "considering tltc competition wasn‘t
too intense. I ran a pretty good race." She also added
that the secret to her fine performance was a “leg
massage." ‘

McCarthy had tltc lead at the rttile mark attd was
never challenged. l-‘our otrt of the top five finishers

ll school. was one of the Danes finest performances as
a team. With Russo in goal. the Danes registered a 2-l
victory.

Although the tearrt has been lttrrt with a few injuries,
they have shown resilience attd “moments of
brilliance" on the field. Sidelined with an ankle injury
until at least Saturday is Anna Courtney, last year's
leading scorer. Witlt Courtney out. the worttert still
played a firtc game.

Marked by excellent dcfertse on the part of Pat
Mastriarti. the Danes slttrt down LcMoyrtc's scoring
threats; Maria Desantcs and Hillary llortert.

Offertsivcly. Strc Slagcl took control of Albany's
scoring. by booting both Dane goals. These were only
two of the Danes 2] shots on goal, to Lernoync's 6.! i

were Danes. as Karcrt Kutthy and lictlc l)/arttha didn‘t
finish that far behind the pace-setters, McCarthy attd
(iril'fin. Albany was down ortc runner and White was
able to talk about the depth of his team. “A real key to
our later success will be if we are able to plug any
holes. it‘s tough to count on irrst four or the runners.
A tcartr must hate depth.“ White is hoping that the
return of iuiurcd rrrtrucr Rorrrric l)anrt will spark the
club.

l-',\eryorrc on the tcattr is looking forward to post-
season competition, which begins October 30 in
(icncsco. “togetherness is what we’ll need against the
tougher Icarus," White corrrrrterrted.

It looks as tltorrgh the women's cross-country learn
is coming around. as the spirit of the crew indicates.
“We‘re starting to put things together, and we're look—
ing forward to post-season." The next meet is on
Tuesday against ()ueouta at home. l l
