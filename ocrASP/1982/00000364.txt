problem all ol~ its face up here is trying to ex-
plain the role tlte paper plays. Our friends
will ask us from tittte to esplain it. and we
always keep searching for tile perl'eet metaphor.
One person said that she I'clt tlte paper was like last

last load is ittst that. last. it doesn't take long to

Voting Wrongs

The arguments have been given and the
judge is making his decision. SA's sttit to
establish art election district and polling
place on campus went to court yesterday.
and now it's' only a few days until we know
if students will have the polling place on
campus they legally deserve.

last Sunday‘s edition'ol' the Tilllt’S-UII/UII
carried an editorial on the topic ol‘ the on-
campus polling place. it was a rather con—

C O L U M

descending piece that asked if these students
in the prime ol~ We couldn't walk the one or
two miles to the present polling places. The
editorial missed the point. Election districts
are not determined by age or occupation oi“
the inhabitants: they are established tor the
convenience of registered voters to en.
courage voting.

Luckily, the editorial writers ol' the
Times-Union do not sit on the bench ol. the
Albany County Court.
