Kidder. "We were just missing by
inches."

to get the goal that was needed."
said Coach Kidder. The Dane score

finally came with three minutes left

Marie with her second goal. The
penetration ended there as both

The Albany women's volleyball
team won a decisive victory over
Union College last Tuesday. The
Spikers took the first two games
15-8, 15-6. narrowly blew the third
game 15-12 arid cariie buck strong in
the fourth gatnc 15-5 to clinch the
match.

Although tltc teatii won, Coach
Pat Dwyer said that, “they played
one of their worst matches and
lacked enthusiasm" against the very
psyched-up Urtion team. He at-
tribtrted the team's problem to the
mental and physical stress of play-
ing tltrec big matches in one week.
in addition to Tuesday’s game. the
spikers play West Point and face
tlte University of Vermont. Smith
College and Hartford, at the Spr-
ingfield Tournament.
