By Mark Gesner
The rumors and fears have run rampant
in the minds and conversations of the sex-
ually active. Mention the work herpes and
you receive reactions ranging from em-
barassment to shock of the
obscene. Fortunately. 
there are now some con-
crete facts available to 
start displacing the tieg Roots
rumors.

Herpes is so widespread in America to-
day. some fear cases will become as fre-
quent as the common cold. in fact. herpes
is similar to the cold. because the "love
virus" has no known cure. However. like
the cold. herpes can also be controlled.

Two strains of Herpes Simplex Virus
(HSV) exist. Oral lterpes (HSV-l) is located
on the lips and facial area. Genital herpes
(HSVd l) is of n venereal nature and can be
found in or on a person’s genital-groin
area.

According to a hook by Tom Mitchell.
You 're Not Alone with Herpes, HSV-i
almost always erupts at the original spot of
infection. Oral herpes. tnore frequently
termed i‘evcr blister. is not exactly the same
as the common cold sore but is caused by a
similar virtis.

Of the two virus strains. genital herpes. a
sexually transmitted disease. probably
causes more concern and anguish.
Although difficult to subscribe in numbers.
Tom Mitchell‘s Herpes Alert Pamphlet
distributed by The information Center On
Herpes Disease estimates that “over 20
million Americans have it. and. unfor-

tunatcly. as many as half a million more
men and women—mainly between the ages
of it? and 35—may be contracting the infec-
tion every year."

Mitchell. a herpes sufferer himself. writes
that HSV-il is “most likely to be con-
tagious only during its active stages.
although some asymptomatic virus carriers
do exist."

Active stages occur when lesions appear
on the surface of the skin around the genital
area. in the case of women. the blisters may
not always be visible if located inside the
vaginal wall.

“When people contract herpes they get
an initial outbreak which is usually the
worst outbreak that they will ever have."
explained Albany Planned Parenthood
Health Educator Jay Silbcr.

The first infection appears a couple of
days to three weeks after exposure. said the
Herpes Alert Pamphlet. ’l‘hc pamphlet f ur-
ther explained that symtoms may include it-
ching and burning sensation followed by
headache and fever, muscle aches. and
swollen glttnds.

These symptoms worsen within a ten day
period during which the painful lesions ap-
pear. The outbreuk may last from three to
six weeks. “Afterward. though. the virus is
still in the body. in a ‘quicl phase'. waiting
to break out and cause new symptoms." the
pamphlet said.

Sometimes the most painful part of hav-
ing genital herpes is the psychological hurt.
“Herpes is associated with all the other
venereal diseases. so it carries along the
same negative connotations." explained

OCTOBER [9, I982 D MLBANY'STUDENTPRESS 

Widespread incurable herpes is controllable

Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and
Genesis Sexual Resource Center Coor.
dinator. Martha Fitch.

“For someone to say they have herpes,
it's a personal challenge to their values."
Fitch said. “So someone who contacts
genital herpes may believe they are pro-
miscuous. The connotation applied is that
you have a variety of sexual partners."

Fitch said that HSV-ll “most often ﬂares
up in stressful situations." Hence, each in-
dividtial is affected differently by the
disease. While some sufferers have several
outbreaks a year. others may only ex-
perience the initial attack.

The disease obviously plays a part in the
carrier's social life as well. “if they tell their
partner. they know the relationship will be
affected." said Fitch. She also noted that
the sufferer “gets very angry at the person
who gave it to them."

"When people get the disease they should
get therapy right away." advised Fitch.
Genesis, located at 105 Schuyler Hall,
Dutch Quad. is equipped with counselors
especially geared to relate to clients with
sexuality problems. “We have a lot of
research information about herpes. We
can't diagnose anything. but we can give
therapy." Fitch said of the resource center.

Albany's Planned Parenthood. located at
259 Lark SL. is one center where a
diagnosis cart he obtained. Millie i’atnode.
a nurse-practioner and the Director of
Client Services at Planned Parcntitood. ex-
plained the center “can make a clinical
diagnosis of herpes. if there is a‘lesion. we
can take a smear of that lesion and make an
identification."

Patnode emphasized the importance of
reporting herpes immediately. Since in-
dividual cases vary, a doctor must be able to
examine and then advise each patient accor-
dingly. ‘

“You can accept the disease it you have
the adequate information. it's not as bad as
you may think.” Patnode said. She explain-
ed that most sufferers can eventually learn
to predict when an outbreak is going to oc-
cut.

"The people who have herpes can easily
live with herpes as long as they know how."
Fitch said.

The must important method of controll-
lng herpes is knowing your own body and
realizing what triggers an outbreak. “for
example. emotional stress. lack of sleep.
poor diet. too tnuch sun or wind, or friction
from wearing tight jeans or leotnrds.

The much publisized anti-viral agent
Acyclouir (Zovirax) has been used to some
degree to success in treating the disease.
Patnode explained that the drug. which is
extremely expensive. can alleviate some of
the symptoms and pain of herpes. and is
especially helpful during the first outbreak.

if you have herpes. think you have
terpcs, or even want to know ways of
tvoidiug the disease. there are several places
where you may seek help. Planned Paren-
thood (434-2182), Genesis (457-80l5).
Albany County Health Department
(455-7821), and Middle Earth Hotline
(457-7800) are all places that may be called
for aid. 4 ('1
