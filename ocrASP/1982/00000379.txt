Rcugans's dct'cnsc budch and
workers' rights to the plight of
Polish Solidarity amid it’s dit-
l‘icuitics.

The conunen denominator of all
.spccchcs was the loss ol'jebs across
the statc and the failure of state of-
t’icinis to remedy the situation.
Henry Landau. Secretary Treasurer
of the Tri-Citics Building Trades
Linton. noted: “If yeti take away a
man‘s dignity by taking away his
job you will create all sorts of social
problems."

SASU Vice President Scott ch-
icr delivered it short speech in which
he pointed out that the similar pro-
blcms local by both workers’
unions and University Students
across the state are cutbacks by the
administration. and both groups
must look l'or ways to voicc lhcir

Solidarity ralliers unite

Many contupiicntctt social pro-
bicms arise ()tIl ol‘ the present titl-
tttinistruiiott's policies. according to
Landau. “This uttcmploymcnt is
crcttting increases in social problctns
such as divorcc, child abuse. and
alcoholism." Itc stutcd . “and thc
unemployment rate in the construc-
tion trades in Albany is the highest
cvcr."

Many political stalcmcnts wcrc
made at the rally. most in favor oi~
Democratic candidate Mario
Cuomo and his running mate
Alfred Dcl Bciio. Labor Unions
across the state endorsed Cuomo at
the rally and according to chairman
Rcdlo. “the unions have been
behind Cttetne from the bcginning
because of his political platform.“
