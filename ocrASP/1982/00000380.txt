himself for three yards and con-
ncctcd with Pete Marlo to advance
the ball inside the Dragon ten-yard
linc. Two carries by Harrison
brought the ball to the three-yard
line setting up Dunhnm's second
touchdown of the day. Lincoln's
extra point attempt was good this
time giving tltc Danes a 2l-7
margin.

The Danes added three more in-
sutttltcc points just as the ﬁrst half
“its drawing to it close on Lincoln‘s
23-yard field goal with just clcvcn
seconds left. 24-7.

Cortland didn‘t waste any time
taking advantage of Cenﬁcld's
ttbscncc frotn ihc defensive line.
The Dragons used thcir powerful
backfield trtndcrn of Cook and
Mike Iiowc to drive 78 yards in just
l'ortr plrtys for rt quick six points.
The drive “its highlighted by
litmc's 4t) yrtrd explosion on ﬁrst
down. It was (‘ook however who

Ihc conversion attempt was not

ham to 24-l3.

l’riorc. filling irt i'or the second con-
\ccttlivc week for the injured Frank
Quinn. pickcd off another Cicply
ptm. Figuring that his team had
firm control of the contest. Ford sat

down Pratt and gave Tom Roth the '

nod for the Danes' series of downs.
Roth moved his team down into
ﬁeld goal range and Lincoln
answered with his second successful
boot of the game to make the score
27-13.

But the Cortland Red Dragons
were not about to roll over yet.
Dragon head coach pulled the
relatively unimpresslve Cleply and
sent in Millich. Taking the ball over
at their own 20<yard line. the
Dragons capped an 80-yard drive
when Millich threw the football into
the skillful arms of Burm. The
senior wide receiver had to make a
graceful diving over the shoulder
catch to haul in his quarterback's
pass.

Albany's lead had now dwindled
to just a single touchdown. Ford
decided to place Pratt back at the
helm to generate some late game of-
fense. On his third play from
scrimmage. Pratt fell to the turf
after running a quarterback keep.

"Losing Canticrd and Pratt nevcr
helps."said Ford after the game.

Both teams traded punts until
with 1:32 left in the game the
Dragons staged their ﬁnal threat of
the contest.

“We didn't do a real good job.”
reflected Ford afterwards. "We
had them on the ropes several times
but kept letting go." fl
