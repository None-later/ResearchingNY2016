Netters snap losing streak

By Randy Roth
5mm: WRITER

The Albany State women's tennis team
convincingly dcfcatcd local rival RPl S-l
last Monday to improve lhcir season record
to 2-7. More significantly, the victory snap-
ped a 7 match winlcss slrcuk which had
dated back to their initial match of the your.

The most promising aspect of the after-
noon was the Danes complctc domination
of the singles ploy. Team Captain Joan
Phillips, Sandra Burrcllc. Hclcne Tishlcr
and Ellen Yun all triumphed in straight sets.
whilc Jessica Trcadway was also victorious,
although shc needed an extra set to dispose
of her Opponent. Sweeping the singles
events was enough to ensure an Albany
team victory.

“l'm really happy with the way cvcryonc
played," Jim Scrbulik. the Albany coach
remarked later in the week. “Sandra and
“done played cspcciaiiy well and Ellen
siinplyoulstcadicd her opponent."

Meanwhile in the doubles play, the duo
of 'Nina Chucng and Anne Rapisardo
triumphed, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6. Albany's only loss
on the day occurred in the second doubles
match, where the relatively inexperienced
freshman and sophomore team of Barbara
Gilbert and Lynn Pucino went down to
defeat by scores of 6-7, I-6.

“We took Union College 100 lightly
earlier in the year and didn‘t make that
same mistake against RPl,” Scrbalik said.
“The potential for a win was there and we
took advantage of it."
