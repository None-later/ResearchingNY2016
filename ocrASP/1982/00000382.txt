The Albany State men's soccer

team made one mistake against
Binghamton on Saturday. and it
cost them the game. The Danes lost
a heartbreaker to the Colonials
l-O. before a large Homecoming
Day Crowd.

said site may have gone "overboard" iit
making such a strong decision.

Gray has an extensive history irt student
government. in the first semester of her
freshman year she served as treasurer of
State Quad Board. She moved up to presi-
dent of that board itt her second semester.
in her sopltorrtorc year sltc served on Cen-

scntester. She served on the Central Council
dttring her senior year until the resignation.

Central Council passed a bill Wednesday
night which said that the rccipictit of the se-
cond highest number of votes on the indian
Quad during this clcctiott will fill the scat
vacated by Gray.

Student Union Chair Alan Wcincr said
"it‘s important to have more titan one
acting for the students."

Acccordiiig to Wciiicr. the two groups
have slightly different purposes. “The job
of the Union is to organize the student

Student Union deserves a budget. The
resignation has no bearing on their
budget.“ said Corso.

The Student Action (‘oiiititittcc was
formed in the spring of 1980 by l'ise
students who felt SA should represent
students in political issues. Since its forma-
tion the comtiiitlee has worked on several
projects including rallying to keep SUNY
tuition doivri and lobbying the state
legislature to prevent SUNY bridgel cuts.

The Student Union was founded eight
years ago by a group of students responding
to SUNYA's plans to use ptibiic transporta-
tion instead of SUNYA‘s "Circen
Machines." lit the past eight years they
have worked with SASU and independently
on sludetit issues such as lowering
bookstore prices and lobbying to prevent
SUNY budget cuts. According to Weiricr.
the Student Union was funded for the first
tirite in lite spring of 1980 and had not re-

quested funding again llhlii this fall. -

'l'ltutsday‘s ruling rejected Cobb‘s dcci~
sioti. stating the municipalities "are not
necessary parties" to the suit.

However. the court also ruled that the
decision will not take affect until the I98]
elections since there are “few days remain-
ing before the election." it is for this reason
that the plaintiffs will file an appeal with
the highest court in tire state in art attempt
to secure on‘caritpus polls for the
November 2 elections. SA Attorney Mark
Mishler said an appeal will be filed today
with the state Court of Appeals.
