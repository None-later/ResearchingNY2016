I Attempts by SUNY Stony Brook to
clamp down on violators of their student
' conduct code has been met with rcscntmcnt
: by students, while the administration claims
I the students are ovcrrcnctlng.
I” The furor centers around a decision by
" Stony Brook President John H. Marburgcr
' to enforce portions of thc codc that one stu-
. dcnt lcadcr cnilcd "archaic."
The University now wants rcsidcncc staff
‘to uphold restrictions on smoking mnri‘
juunn in a public plncc. puny curfew vioin-
tions and drinking by minors. Any viola-

 

. lions would then bc subjch to univcrsity

disciplinary procccdings with punishments
ranging from u rcprirnnnd to possible cxpul-
sion.

tions thnl :u'c hcrc, don‘t uppcnr to hnppcn

sold.

The lnrgcst thorn in lhc sludcnts' sidcs,
Ridholt/ sand. is the rnnrijuunn policy. ililll
hc cxpccts lhcrc will hc problems with cn-
t‘orccmcnt.

"The policc nrcn't hoping to cnl‘orcc it. i

public sui'cty oi‘ficcrs,“ Ridhnllz clnlmcd,

and said that tilliil now he ncvcr mudc llml

it.

said that “anything was linhlc to lutppcn."

rcports from I’csidcnl assistants ol’ viola-
tions, smokc mzu'ijuanu. "You can't cxpcct
lhcm to cnt'orcc it," hc said.

Ridholt/ snid Ilnu lhc utliludc of thc

'- ‘

residence hall director is to not enforce it as
it is "a silly rule” and an “additional
burden they are not being compensated
for.”

“The R.A.‘s are seen as peer counselors. .

That role will vanish if they bust students
*l‘or‘smoklng pot." Ridlioitz said; Legally
the burden of proof is on the R.A., an SPA
:nttorncy has concluded, and that, Ridhoitz
said, could lead to a defamation of
character lawsuit. Rldholtz said that SPA is
prepared tozrcprcscnt the plaintiff in such a
suit. Off-campus there is no liability. The
landlorddocsn't care what you are doing.
The state is claiming not to bc our landlord,
but they want to bc lhc moral dictators of
policy," said Ridhollz.

i-ic and iinuman also disagreed on the
motivations for the policy. Ridhoirz con-
lcndcd that Marburgcr is concerned with
the outside image of lhc University.

“Stony Brook is known is lhc country for
being ncndcmiculiy rcpuinblc. There are u
lot of strong fluids of study. Within Ncw
York slutc, it isn't as rcputablc,” he said.

()nc rcuson for that is lhc lingcring im-
prcsslons from :1 i968 drug raid that ncticd
2t‘ urrcsls. “th cvcry sludcnt urrcswd in
than drug ruid hns bccn grnduulcd for at
[cost tcn ycnrs," lnrncmcd Ridhollz.

“'l‘hc mcdlu is looking to jump on our
throats. llut i don't mind it ii‘sludcnts start
getting bustcd, wc just ycii ‘Ncwsdny' (the
Long islnnd dnily ncwspupcr) and they

lint llnunnm suid Ihul lhc imngc problem

Thomas M. Whnlcn, iii, Albany Com-

conl'crcncc hcrc Tucsdny night lhnl hc docs
not l'uvor or support in student polling plncc
on lhc uptown SUNYA campus.

Whulcn had “substantive problems"
with the studcnls' dcmund, saying that
sludcnts voting nwny from home are not

town "I would not wnnl lo volc whcrc l
hch no roots," and pointed to thc ubscntcc
bullol as an alternative.

Whalen said that he
would “seriously
entertain” the
possibility of
running for mayor
should Corning be
unable to run.

 

Whnlcn said that sctling up at polling
plncc on lhc uptown cnmpus would bc
showing it prct‘crcncc for student voters
ruthcr than their equality in thc voting
place. He bclichd thc polling places at
Saint Mnrgnrct Mary's Church on Wcsicrn
Avcnuc and (It lhc Mckuownvillc l"irc
l)cpnrlmcnl on \Vcstcrn Avcnnc are not too
difficult to rcuch, and i‘ccls that for

thcsc polling placcs Werc in violation ot' scc-
tion 4-100 of the Election Law bccnusc the

tion. Whulcn rcplicd thnl ltc was unl'umiliur
with that purl of the law and was unuwurc
lhcrc is such a lcgul limit.

Mishlcr is prcscntly uppculing u Ncw
York Slutc Suprcmc Court of Albany dcci~
sion to rcjcct n lawsuit filed by SUNYA
students to cslnblish un orwurnpus voting
place.

At lhc prcss conl'crcncc, Whnlcn nddrcss-

ing guhcrnntoriul clcciion. his rolc in lhc
nbscncc of Albany Mayor Erastus Corning,
who is prcscntly undergoing lhcrnpy for n
rcspirntory problem nt :1 lluslon hospital,
and ihc [983 Albany County budgcl.

Whulcn snid that he would “seriously
entertain“ the possibility oi~ running for
mayor should Corning be unable to run in
the next clcclion, but emphasized that thch
is “no doubt (but the mayor still has thc
powcr. Thcrc is no one looming on the
horirun to take that away.” He said that
lhc oiling mayor is doing well and is rcspon-
ding wcll to therapy, and noted that the
mayor’s albscncc has made people work
morc Iogcthcr zmd that the county‘s dcpurl-
mcnl hcuds cspcciully are “rising to lhc oc—
cusion."

Thc outcomc ot' the dcmocrulic primnry
clcction surprised Whulcn. He said lluu
although he had supported Cuomo in thc
clcclion. hc hnd i‘cit [hut Ncw York City
Muyor lid Koch was going to win both lhc
primary nnd gcncrul clcclions. Whnlcn said
that Mnyor Corning's cndorsumcnt ot'
