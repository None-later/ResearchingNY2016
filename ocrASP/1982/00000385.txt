Sitting inconspicuoust two t‘loors above
Mohawk towcr's penthouse on lndian
Quad is SUNYA's weather center. The
square. low-ceiling room with broad. slan-
ting windows was httilt ill 1966. It houses all
of the standard weather instruments. said
Raymond Falconer. research associate of
tile Atmospheric Science Research Center
(ASRC‘) of the University.

Tlle basic instrlrrncnls tneasure
temperature arid dew point (the
tctuperatlrrc at which dew starts to
I‘orm).wind speed and direction. precipita-
tion. and solar radiation. These indicators.
attached to the sides and top of the
building. jut ottt like awkward arms decked
with cones arid propellers. An eight foot
metal ladder atld a trapdoor in tlte ceiling of
the room lead to the sunny tweny-fifth
floor of Mohawk tower. A gravcllcd ﬂoor
without walls or ceiling enjoys a stiff breeze
and is where the precipitation and wind
speed ittdicators are grounded. Metal
canisters surrounded by a suspended skirt
of ruetal rectattglcs measure rain and snow
precipitation. The data gathered by these
instruments are fed into terminals in the
weather cerlter room, which record ttnd
graph the information. .

The cerltcr is suitable for various types of

 

“yr—4...”...

weather research. In the past. fog and
lightning studies have been done there,
Falconer said. He added that researchers
Bernard Vonnegut and Richard Orville of
the ASRC collect liglttning data with time-
lapse movies from sprittg through autumn.
Until a few years ago. other utmosheric
science researchers couduted solar radiation
studies from SUNYA's weather center. ac-
cording to Bruce Bailey, ntctcorologist and
assistant to the director of tile ASRC.

The center is University funded through
the atmospheric science department. All
research projects. however. are funded by
rcsettrclt grants.

Not surprisingly. the center has been af-
fected by university-wide htldget cuts and,
as Falconer said. the cuts have “tirade it dif-
ficult" to keep the personnel to run the
cetttcr and maintain the equipment.

At least one person can manage the
ccttter. he said. and ill the pasta workstudy

 

student or art atmospheric science matizsr
has filled the polition. This fall. a local high
school student involved in a career explora-
tion program works itt the center a few days
a week. A stack of boxes contains imforma-
tion from I973 and is at the disposal of the
researchers.

Although there are not any irltcrns using
the center now, Falconer remarked. it
would be pollible to incorporate the center
into all appropriate internship program. F]

Search resumes for new Student Affairs V. P.

 

By [Ian Nissan

 

The University has resumed its search for
a candidate to fill the vacant position of
Vice-President of Student Affairs since the
DOB lifted the SUNY hiring freeze October
14.

Although the University had continued
its search throughout the freeze. the school
was not in the position to hire anyone until
now.

The salary needed to attract qualified ap-
plicants will have to be high. according to
Assistant to the President. James Volkwein
who estimated thst the “salary will be
higher than $45,000. at least".

The shaky budget situation that tcr-
minatcd the position last year no longer ex-
ists said Volkwein.

The search began in the fall of 198] but
was abandoned when the funds did not
come through for the pOSition. The Univer-
sity has reconstituted its search-committee
in order to find a worthy candidate.

Presently the duties of a Vice-President
of Strident Affairs include financial aid.
counseling, health services. admissions. and
residence. which are presently being coor-
dinated by Vice—President for University
Affairs Louis P. Wclch. Volkwein said
there are various reasons why we need a

Vice-President for Student Affairs. He
specifically stated that President O'Leary
was reorganizing the present administration
to divide the workload more evenly than in
the past and because "Weleh is really pick-
ing tip the slack and we need someone who
can devote his full energies to the job."

The search committee consists of
students and faculty administrators from
different offices and departments
throughout the University.

Student search-committee member Cathy
LaSusa said. "It is important that we have a
Vice-President whose sole functiort would
be to attend to the concertts of student of-

fairs."

 

’/

LaSusa pointed out that."We are looking
for the most well-rounded a person as we
can find." The criteria includes leadership
and management skills as well as ad-
ministrative experience at colleges similar in
size atld student composition to SUNYA.

Last year a pool of 120 applicants was
narrowed to to but since the funds did not
come through, they had to be notiﬁed the
position was Ito longer available.

According to Director of Personnel Leon
J. Calhoun Sr.. Tire Division of the Budget
(DOD) has conditionally lifted the freeze
which leaves SUNYA with “approximately
