Settlement closer in NFL strike

By Ira Rosenteld
Assocm TED PRESS
Cookeysvllle. Md.

There is progress in negotiations
to end the month-old National
Football League strike and there
could be a settlement within a week.
sources on both the union and
management sides said Thursday.

“if progress continues at the cur-
rent rate it is plausible we could
have a settlement by next Trresday
or Wednesday." said a union
source at the bargaining table.

“There ltas definitely been pro-
gress during the last 24 hours." said
a management source monitoring
the talks. “i wouldn't disagree with
a week-long timetable."

Meanwhile. the National Labor
Relations llnard's top lawyer arr-
rrorrrrced in Washington that he will
isstre a complaint charging the NH.
lras engaged in unfair labor prac—
tices in negotiations with the
players‘ rrniorr.

William A. Lubbcrs. general
counsel of the five-member board.
said the corrrplairrt will be based in
prtrt on managerrrent's “refusal to
bargain in good taitlt with the rrrriorr
and failing to give the union infor-
rrrrrtion relevant to collective
bargaining..."

There was no immediate response
from the Management Council. in
the strike talks. the sources. while
confident the talks are moving in
the right direction. were quick to
note that major economic dil'»
ferenccs rerrtain.

Mediator Sam Kach said
negotiators were “going into each
of the economic issues in great
depth." He said that negotiators,
meeting with subcommittees, are
examining about is specific
economic areas, although most of
the work Wednesday night rrrrd
Thursday centered on pensions and
itrstrrarrcc.

Lubbers, irt his statement. said
the NFL will be given a chance to
settle the case before a complaint is
issued. If there is a complaint, it
would be heard before an ad-
ministrative law judge and the NH.
would have the right of appeal to
the federal courts.

Negotiators trying to hammer ortt
a new collective bargaining agree»
rnerrt have been meeting in this
suburb of Baltimore for the past it)
days.

With the NH. announcing that
this weekend‘s games would not be
played. the fifth weekend of the
regular season to he ttiped out by
the strike, ttttrrlrtings trl discontent
are being heard Irorrr the field.

“When you get live weeks into a
slr'ike you have to ll.l\ e .t ten people
getting rrerurtts." srrrtl rrrriort L'lllCl

More football fans syrrrpathi/e
with the owners than with the
players in the strike that has wiped
out six weekends of National Foot.
ball League play, according to an

Associated Press-NBC News poll.

But the strike will make no dif-
ference in how a majority of the
fans follow the game when play

resumes. the poll also found.
in the nationwide telephone poll
of l,595 adults Monday and Tuos-
day, nearly half — 48 percent —
said they are fans of professional
football.

J

New Orleans Saints' player
representative said Thursday he will
poll Saints' players to see it they are
interested in returning to camp.
Erxleben, who in the past has ex-
pressed reservations about the
strike. said the key to the players I
coming back would be a promise by
the owners to bargain in good faith.

And in a television interview on
NBC‘s "Today" program. San
Fransisco tight end Russ Francis
called for the union's 1,500 players
to meet and conduct a secret ballot
to determine whether the players
should return to work without a
signed contract.

"It is time we all got together to

bring about a resolution to this pro-
blem," Francis sale. “it is time to
regain control of the situation and
take an active role in the resolution
of the dispute."

But other players questioned
those moves. “Part of the problem
is guys like Francis," said Bears‘
quarterback Bob Avellini. a strong
union supporter who played in one
of its all-star games. "Comments
like that can only prolong the
strike. The owners have a gag rtrle
where it costs them $l00.000 if they
