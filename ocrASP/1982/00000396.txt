, Quick action by two RA's put out a fire
of unknown cause in State Quad‘s Cooper
Hall Sunday morning. preventing what
could have been a more serious inconvie-
nience to Cooper and Anthony Halls.

At 2:47 am. the fire alarm sounded in
Cooper 202. triggered by the heat sensors
on the ceiling of RA Amy Siegel's
bedroom. The fire apparently started in her
wastebasket while Siege] was in the
bathroom, according to her ‘ ‘
Elizabeth Hauschild.

Hauschild said Siege] "was great during
the fire. She just closed her door and got
out of here.“

On-duty RA Dave Karlin, Director of
Cooper and Whitman Hails Chris Woodell.
and RA Jeff Levine responded to the alarm

 

and met Siege] in the hall. where she
directed them to her bedroom. Levine and
Kariin grabbed fire extinguishers on the
way and put out the blaze. which had
spread to the bed and was climbing up the
wall. '

_Meanw_hile, Siege] andmother RAs helped

and broke the windows to air out the smok-
ing room.

The Fire Department conducted an in-
vestigation on the spot before allowing
residents of the two dorms to return to their
rooms at approximately 4:00 am.

The ﬁnal report has not been submitted

or cigarette. “

Siege] explained, “We didn't know what
was happening — it all happened in three
minutes."

ruled out the possibility of arson or an elec-

goes off the Physical Plant receives the
alarm, notiﬁes the Fire Department and
sends representatives to the scene. The
Physical Plant handles all on-campus
details of a fire, including all necessary
maintenance after a fire.

Stevens said Siegel’s room ’shouid
be"comp]etely refurbished by Friday,"with
the exception of any personal property that
was damaged, which is to be replaced by
Siege].

" ' ln her room includes clean-
ing the smoke and water damaged room,
replacing the windows and mattress. and
some repainting. Stevens estimates that the
cost including supplies and labor, will be in
excess of 52000. With the exception of
some minor smoke and water damage, the
damage was limited to Siegel’s room. [I]

Thieves vandalize 6 cars in Indian parking lot

 

ﬂy Amey Adams

 

Latc Wednesday night six cars were
vandalized in indinn Quad’s parking lot
with the thieves stealing five car stereos. one
equalizer and other items.

The value of the stolen merchandise was
assessed at $2.500. according to Assistant
Director of Public Safety, John I-Ienighan.
"It was all pretty good equipment," he
said.

Lieutenant Gus Polll of Public Safety
said. "The apparent method of entry is a
hole forced under the door lock with some
sharp instrument and the same instrument
or another object is used to cause the lock
to release." However, Polli could not pin-
point the cxact time of the thefts.

"The greater percent (of such vandalism)
occurs in indian due to the wooded areas,
the lighting. the number of vehicles parked
there, and the easy entrance and exit from
the lot." said I’olli.

Henighan originally felt the thefts were
al. but now believes this is not
no .irtly the case. "There are other
ruttchincs for taking out locks. this was not
50 professional." However, he believed
that the thief was not from the area. “It’s
an unusual occurcuce. There is no indica-
tion that this (mode of entry) has happened
in the city of Albany before. it's something
you might see in New York."

an Wednesday victim, Susan Gentile.
has had her car vandalized four times in the
last two years. Thursday afternoon she
went down to lndian lot and found her car
had been broken into. The burglar alarm
system on her 1980 Camaro was bypassed,
and her Kcnwood AM-FM cassette-stereo
as well as a jacket and some tapes were
taken. -

“i wouldn't be as enraged if it was the
first time. Where does it stop? 1 parked in
a bad area of the Bronx all summer and my
car was never touched," she said.

When Gentile asked one of the officers if
they patrolled the lots, site said he told her

The vast quad parking lots make parked cars easy marks
A short staffed police force finds it hard to properly patrol parking lots.

“it's pretty boring looking at the sarncdot

“Where is security? I don't understand
what their job is. i think they have a lot of
nerve giving me $5 tickets for parking on
the quad when i couldn’t even lock my car.
I would love to see everyone parking in the
quad. I don't know what to do to change

Polli said that patrols have not been in-

relocate employees whose positions are in
danger of being cut out of the budget.

Reilly said the disparity fund is important
because there is “a need for equity in
salary" that the state generally “has no in-
terest" in. The committee will attempt to
even out some of the inequities.

Most of the committees responsible for
developing these new programs and I

related" to budget cuts, he said.

“We’re an essential service, but they're
not letting us fill (vacancies)." The state
and university determine where priorities lie
and what positions on campus should be
filled, he said.

"We can't physically be everywhere at
once," said Polli. He advises students,

Polli maintained, “Of the 26 depart-

best managed, most progressive, and best
staffed as far as quality personnel.”

chighan said he did not expect anymore
lhcfts of this nature. "The pattern is that it
only happens once. it wouldn't be smart
for the 'bad-guy' to come back again."

The investigator assigned to the case
could not be reached for comment. Cl
