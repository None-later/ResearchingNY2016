Citizens Party’s
Mark Dunlea
reduces race
to three issues

— llpy-Ahthony Silber

 

According to Mark Dunlea. Citizen Par-
ty candidatc for tltc 23rd Congressional
district. both his own philosophy arid that
of his party are based on the premise that
wltilc lltc major parties feel the system is itt
ncctl of a fine tuning. irt actttality it has
serious l‘untlamcntal problcms.

Dunlea narrow down thc campaign issues
to a “big thr'cc: \vcapons. jobs. and the cit-
vironmcnt." Dunlctt is quite careful to
point out that he is a disarmament catt-
didatc and not a freeze candidalc. although
hctsaid he “would votc for a unilateral
l'rccrc in nuclear weapons arid a unilateral
lcduclion." On other military issucs.
Dunlea narrowed down the campaign issttcs
military activity, and believes that tltc
Unitctl States should protcct only its own

|ordcrs but at the same time he also said hc
sttpports thc cottccpt of NATO provided it
has littropcan leadership. and is against
draft rcgistration.

Thu 28 year-old Duttlca was born in
Iartford. Connecticut andltas livcd iii the
Albany arctt sincc I972 \vhcn hc bcgan col-

lcgc.

To eliminate uncmploytncnl. Dunlea said
hc favors legislation rcquiring full employ-
ment. supports guaranteed income pro-
grams. and bclicvcs that a significant
number of jobs could be found in an ex-
pandcd public works program. He also ex-
pressed his pleasure in seeing some elements
of organized labor shifting toward the
citizens party.

Although he said he has “moved
beyond" NYPlRG, Dunlea shares many of
the same priorities as NYPIRG. Most
notable is his concern about the environ-

"* ' ‘   Stratton well favored over
Dow for Congressional seat

 

By Ray Callﬁplre
STAFF mm

After defeating his Democratic primary
opponent by .1 wide margin. Republican
Samuel S. Stratton is heavily favored to win
his thirteenth consecutive term in the
Capital District’s Congressional race.

Stratton won by a three to one margin
over former Mid-Hudson area Con-
gressman John Dow. who is the Liberal
Party nominee in the November 2 election.

With strong support from built labor and
industry, Stratton has bccn unbeatable
since he was first elected in l958. usually
winning with 80 percent of the vote.

As tltc third ranking member of the
House Armed Services Comtnittcc and
chairman of tltc subcommittee on Procure-
ment and Military Nuclear Systems. Strat-
ton htts control over billions of dollars in
military outlays.

President Reagan‘s proposals for
substantial military increases have been
stccrcd through the Dcrrtocrtttic-controllcd
House of Representatives by Stratton. a
war-hawk who bclicvcs the US. must arm
itself against the Soviets to prevent what he
sccs as lhcir goal of world domination.

“lly providing a strong dctcrrcnt to tile
Soviet Union." said Stratton to tltc
.S't‘ltunecltuly Gazette. “we ltavc prcvcntcd
World War lll. which i think a lot of peo-
ple don't appreciate."

Stratton favors negotiations on nuclear
arms with the Soviets as long as the US. is
iii a good bargaining position.

"Thc only way you cart gel the Soviets to
agrcc to arty limitations." Stratton told the
Schenectady Gazette. “is to indicate that if
they don't do it they’re going to have to
face an increased threat from as."

Liberal Party candidate John Dow
vchcntcntly opposes Stratton's military

policies. especially those on nuclear arms
production. Dow is El strong supporter of a
nuclear freeze and is a founder of
Americans Against Nuclear War.

Dow belicvcs nuclear weapons are the
greatest threat to the world today. and that
politicians like Stratton are moving the
US. closer to nuclear war with the Soviets.
A forntcr three-term representative. Dow
was one of the ﬁrst congrcssmcn to publicly
oppose the Vietnam war.

Dow charges Stratton with increasing
unemployment in tltc State. noting that
civilian spcrtding creates three times as
many jobs as military spending. Every
billion dollar increase in military spending
costs l().000 jobs, Dow argues. and the
military cmploys only two percent of the
District area's workers.

Stratton counters by pointing ottt that if
the billions spent in NY. on military pro-
grams went for leaf-raking jobs instead.
“runny more jobs would rcsult--ulthough
adrnittcdly. no one seems to be quite clear
as to just how dependable those jobs would
be. or tltc wage rate. or the medical or
retirement benefits involved."

in order to create jobs. says Dow.
ntilitary money must be dchrtcd for the
construction of bridges and new homes. He
says tltc $40 billion. uscd for constructiort
would prodttcc l.6 million jobs.

Dow is campaigning on a platform cttll-
ittg for substantial reductions in military
spcnding and creation of more civilian jobs;
incrcascd t‘cdcral spcudirtg for improvement
of public facilities such as. roads. bridges
and mass transit; rcstoring cuts in public
cmploymcttt scrvicc stalling and prcvcrttittg

industry from moving to non-union areas.

Dow is an advocate for women's rights.
cnvironmcntal protection anti Civil Rights.

Republican Wicks aims at
jobs, nuclear arms freeze

Frank Wicks is the Republican candidate
for thc 23rd Congr'cssional District. A rcsi-
dcnt of Schcncctady t'or twcnly ycars. tltc
43-year-old Wicks is also running on art in-
dcpcndcnt Nttclcar l’t'cc/c Iinc.

in an interview, Wicks said that hc has
been active iii the Coalition for Full
Employment and linct'gy Conservation. a
labor-oriented organization conccrncd with
conserving rcsourccs. One result of his
work in this coaltion has bccn the l'oumula-
{ion of many of his campaign ideas.

Like many candidates this fall. Wicks is
campaigning on the issues of jobs and the
nuclear frcczc. Wicks said that he favors a
mutual and verifiable freeze. but with our
present arsenal of nuclear weapons. even a
unilatcral frccc would not endanger the
balance of power. “l am incredulous that
anyone could argue against a freeze. yet

Stratton is strongly against it." hc said.

On other tlcl‘cnsc-rclatcd issucs, Wicks
said that ltc hclicvcs that all NATO coun-
tries should pay tltc same pcrccntagc of
lltcir gross national products to thc Alliancc
as tltc U.S. docs, bccausc now lhc domcstic
support of NA'lO is itt cl'l'cct raising
Amcrican good's priccs by scvcn percent
and thus undercutting our ability to corn-
pctc in international rnurkcts. Wicks said
that he believed that the nation should
spend what is ncccssary for dcfcnsc. but ill
this case it is too much. Wicks supports
draft registration. and says that "the basic
problem is really to avoid using the
draftccs.”

Wicks sees a program of jobs and na-
tional prosperitry thourgh energy conscr-
vaton. He said. “the right program is the

Maybeny seeks
to bring ideas
of socialism

to Congress

Pat Maybcrry. eight-year veteran of the
Socialist Workcrs' Party. is rutttting for
Congrcss' 23rd District scat. She strcsscs
that her party is tliffcrcrtl frotn the more
prominent international Socialist Party.
and points to tltc model of Poland's
Solidarity union as the proper way to run a
society.

0n student issues. Maybcrry feels
“education should be free. i think there is
cnough money in this country that whoever
wants to go to collcgc can go.”

She favors studcnt control of the cam-
pus. and believes that people who don‘t
teach and don‘t learn — the administration
—- should not dictate rulcs. She favors a
cooperative effort between teachers and
students. Maybcrry opposes ROTC and ac-
tivcly supports tltosc who dcty draft
registration.

Maybcrry quolcd an Albany Times
Union poll as putting the number of
unemployed in ltcr district at 40,000. "i
would pttt people back to work," she said.
"by using my office to initiate a massive
public works program — highways.
hospitals. housing and clcaning up the en-
vironment." Maybcrry says that another
way to reduce unemployment would be to
decrease the work week to 30 hours with 40
hours pay. According to Maybcrry. this
policy would crcatc many more jobs.

Maybcrry l‘ccls it is important to differen-
tiate her campaign from those of her op-
poncnts. She believes that if she had Sam
Stratton's money she would win the elec-
tio and that tltc majority of the American
people are coming around to her View. She
said. “I am the only candidate who feels
that capitalists must be thrown out.
Workers and farmers should run the na-

tion."
