Clyne. EffrOn vie'iorccun'ty Judge '

By Bob Gardlnler

In the race for Albany County Court Judge next
week, incumbent Democrat John J. Clyne and oppos-
ing Republican candidate Joshua Effron had conflic-
ting views of judicial responsibilities.

County Judge since 1972. the conservative. Clyne.
has a reputation for handing dOWn tough decisions.
“My sentencing is on the heavy side especially for
violent and drug related crimes." he said.

Clyne considers the student vote insigniﬁcant com-
pared to the community vote. “Students ate tran-
sients. here for only a few years. they should vote back
home where their roots are," he said. Ciyne's views
are in direct agreement with those expressed by
Thomas Whalen Ill. Albany Common Council Presi-
dent, at a recent press conference on campus.

Effron. a practicing attorney for 20 years. could not
comment on Ciyne's strict stand. sayng. “Clyne has
inside knowledge about the job that I don't and
because of judicial ethics I can't politically comment
on his practices." Effron did say, however, that he
disagrees with Clyne on the student vote: "Students
should be free to vote here or at home." Effron said
that he sees his campaign as an uphill battle against the
incumbent and said, “It's a doubly uphill battle to run
against an incumbent from the dominant (Democratic)
party machine."

Clyne became the center of controversy after his
election to County Court ten years ago. He was accus;
cd by the Albany Times Union of partisan politics
as an active member of the O'Connell Democratic
machine. The Judicial Code of Ethics prohibits ajudge
from becoming involved in politics. Regarding his cur-
rent position on the matter Clyne said, “I don't
become involved in politics because of my position.
But. leaning over his desk. he emphasize. “I don't like
it; it has a chilling effect on my ﬁrst amendment
right."

Effron countered Rlyne‘s feelings on judicial ethics
pointing out that he automatically agreed to the rules
when he decided to run for the office. “I respect the
rules as vital to the system. Judges should not even
hint at partiality." he said..

Clyne exerted some strong words about SUNYA
students and drugs. He made it clear that it wouldn't
be to a student's advantage to come before him on
drug charges. “Every year I get some student in here
on drug charges. They’re crying. the parents are cry-

 

ing and I still hand them a felony conviction," he said. .

Effron replied to Ciyne‘s comments on students and
drugs, saying that he knows that students have been
fearfuly oppressed during freshman orientation in the
past by the strict warnings from the Albany law
makers regarding drugs. He declined to ﬁeld any of
his own Opinions in agreement or opposition of Judge
Clyne. however.

Both candidates are in favor of the death penalty.
although they cite different reasons. They both agree
that capital punishment is a deterent to violent crime in
most cases.

“i feel it has been an essential part of western and
eastern civilization from the beginning." said Effron.
Clyne elaborated on the subject further stating that he
does not consider the death penalty immoral as some
purport. “Society has a right to protect itself. It
shows respect for the victims of a crime." he said.

Clyne added that the position of County Court
Judge has no power over decisions concerning capital
punishment on the state level.

Effron pointed to some areas of improvement need-
ed in the judicial system. “I‘m more concerned about
compensation forthe victims of crimes." he said. Ac-
cording to Effron, the state pays $25,000 for every per-
son this is convicted of a crime but pays nothing to
help the victim." There is too much emphasis given to
the wrongdoer and the Crime Victims Compensation
Board does not do near enough for the vicitm.” he
noted. The Crime Victims Compensation Board was
set up to help victims of crimes with monetary aid.

Effron also added that the justice system should be
more involved with crime education. He would be in
favor of reviving the Seared Straight Program which
takes juveniles to high security prisons to view what
life is like there. “We have to stop the criminal at a
young age." he said.

Clyne had strong feelings against information about
an accused released before the trial. “Why not be sure
the defendant gets a fair trial - does withholding infor-
mation hurt anyone, really?“ he said. Clyne had no
objections to media coverage during or after a trial and
did not take a stand against television cameras in the
court room. .

Effron, however. feels that it would be a mistake to
put cameras in court. He related from personal ex-
perience that while in Florida, where cameras in the
court room are legal. he saw the proceedings turn into
a show where “the lawyers and others were hamming it
up playing to the cameras. It was deﬁnitely distracting
to a fair trial," he said. El
