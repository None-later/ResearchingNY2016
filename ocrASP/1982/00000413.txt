of the Week

"I haven‘t missed a game here for over 40 years."
explained 86 year old Joe Segolo tit Wednesday‘s
Albany-Vassar women‘s soccer match.

“There's not a referee here who can tell me a thing
about this grant." said Segolo. a man who first kicked
luround a soccer brill more than ilO years ago. "I know
everything there is to know about this game."

In fuel to call Segolojust a fan is somewhat ofrin irr-
justice. The man is truly irt love with the sport he still
calls “football”.

Before retiring to the boisterous spectator lte is to-
day. Segolo spent nturty years of coaching soccer in
Albany rlttd abroad.

Two of the players’ names he has eoaelted truly be
familiar to (treat Dane fans. llill Seltiet'l‘elin. the pre-
sent men‘s soccer coach. arid Joe (iat'ela. llte coaclt
before Scliiel’t'elitt. were botlt mentored by Segolo iti
their playing yettrs.

"l earl just about tell ya ltow ritrtriy blades of grass
{there are on this Iicld." chuckled Seeolo. llis
Il'rleelious claim is probably not so lat from the truth.
