A robbery was committed in
Troy on Wednesday by two men
wearing black. Stolen from the
Albany State men's soccer team
were a victory and a chance for a
winning season.

The R.P.l. Engineers defeated
the Danes 2-I in what Head Coach
Bill Schicfl‘elin termed, “the worst
officiating I‘ve seen since I've been
irt coaching. It would be hard to
describe to someone who wasn’t
there. It was just had. totally bad."
R.P.I. Head Coach Alan Goodyear
agreed with Schicffclin's assessment
of thc officiating.

Referees Don Weber and Neil
Riddcll were the responsible parties.

"They blatantly intimidated otrr
players.“ said Schicl’l'clin. "It was
ridiculous."

“We played so hard. and they
itrst look thc game away from us,"
said goalic Tom Merritt, who was
the victim of one of many bttd calls.

l‘hc lingittccts trailed l-(l entering
the second half. Less than a minute
into the half. R.I’.l. attacked the
Albany goal with heavy pressure. A
ball right in front ofthc not touched
the hand of oIIc of the l-anittccrs
and wcrtt into the net. Albany wat-
chcd in disbelief as Tom Rathjc was
credited with a goal. from Yavus
lirkan at 45:5tt.

Stunned frotn thc allowing ol‘ the
goal, Albanych lhc linginccrs enter
the penalty box untnolcstcd, leading
to l(.l’.|.'s sccotrd goal just 1]
seconds ltttct'. Gerhard lsup scored
the garnc winner as lirkan picked up
his second assist.

Albany had opcned the scoring at 36:31, as senior
.loltrt Markes beat goalie Steve Connolly with a low
shot to the left side. Jerry lsaacs was credited with an
assist. as he created the goal breaking down the
sidelines on a feed front Matt McShcrry.

R.P.l.. out-matched and out-skilled, resorted to a
rough tight marking game. They particularly set their
mark on lsaacs. 'l‘om Little trailed lsaacs all game. hit-
tirtg him at every opportunity. Little brought down
the main Dane offensive threat many times. as Isaacs
tried to break into the clear. “.lcrry has developed a
reputation and everyone tries to get him. The rcfcrccs
shouldn't allow that to happen." said SclIicl'fcliIt.

Albany was never able to get on track because of the
poor officiating. R.l’.l. opened the game with their
“play them close and tough" strategy in an attempt to
break the flow of the Danes pattern offense. Riddcll
and Weber did not call a consistent game. Schicffelin
pointed to the distribution of three yellow cards to
Dancs lsaacs, McShcrt'y and Paul Aspland within the
first 21 minutes as part of the blatant intimidation".

However the referees lct many fouls go uncalled iIt bct‘

22 players and turned towards the two men officiating.

Albany's record dropped to 4-6-3 with the loss. The

Many timcs a losing team will complain about the of-

us the garlic." On Wednesday, the entire tempo of the
game was sct by the referees. “It would be hard to

[1‘1er Rutherford. NJ.
(AP) New York (iiants guard Billy
Ard is applying to graduate school.
Like his teammates, he isn‘t coun-
ting on playing football again this
year.

l-lowcvcr, the 23»ycar—old Ard
corttittttcs to work out on his own
just in case the National Football
Lcaguc players strike is resolved in
lime to salvage the season.

.“I want to play rcttl had." said
Ard, who voltrntarily reported to
training catnp a week early in July.

“You would think with all this
money around. and intelligent pco~
plc talking. something cottld be
worked otrt. It seems to me the
players are giving in slowly, and it
seems we're the only flexible side."
he said during a telephone interview
front his Summit home.

Most of the New York Giants
players say they have given up on
the season.

“We met the other night, and the
Giants decided to go home." said

1 player representative Beasley Reece.

“Giving up means going home to

your off-season jobs. Wc'vc kind of arId they'll just have dwindch their

lost hope." Rcccc said.

The Giants havc abandoned faith
in the ability of NFL Players
Association to negotiate a new col—
lcctivc bargaining agrccrncttt with
management bcforc thc season
ends. players said.

“'l‘hat‘s the feeling I have," Ard
said.

But the players appear united in
their rcsolvc to stay away frotn tltc
stadium for as long as the statement
lasts.

“Some of Its don‘t agree with
sortie aspects of the strike. bttt we
all agree that we have to stick
together on this," said vctcran
linebacker Brad Van Pelt. “We're
all in it together."

“We have a problem with the
fact that only a few guys live in this
area all year," said Reecc.

“They have been paying the high
metropolitan area rents and it's
drawing on their savings accounts.
So they t'igurcd, why should they
stay here paying rent when the
season's going tp' b‘e OVer’anyway.‘

savings accounts," he said.
Although the players have bcctr

harshly critici/cd by fans, Rcccc

said they have not been snubbed.

“The community has laid itsclf

open to Its. livcrytitnc \vc nccd a
Itoth or a restaurant or stilttcplttcc
to ltavc a meeting. it‘s l'rcc. And we
get an open bar and food." Rcccc
said.

Ard, who has a college degree itt
economics, said he is spending his
time workirtg out, watching soap
operas and applying to Seton Hall
and Fairleigh Dickinson universities
for masters of business administra-
tion program.

"I am still working out." said
Ards. “I run and I lift. I'm looking
for a job. and I've had a few inter-
views. l'm applying to graduate
school, too. If worse comes to
worseI I’ll go to school for my
MBA in January.

“If this goes past early
November. I can't see the season

starting up agatn."'added Ard. r L]
