Alcohol is a drug. it is the most socially
accepted drug in society today. Alcoholism
is the disabling condition resulting from un-
controlled drinking. "in terms of system-
wide damage to the body, nothing comes
close to alcoholism," said Middle Earth
Coordinator Dr. David Jenkins.

Similar to other drugs. alcohol triggers a

different reaction in each 

individual. However. a

 

Middle Earth tape entitled Earth
Decision Making About
Drinking does state that 

"alcohol, taken in small doses. tends to act
like a mild trunquilizer . . . heavy intake of
alcohol can serve as an anesthetic —
ancstltetizing the deepest levels of brain
function."

Although alcohol has been proven to be a
potent drug. statistics show about seven out
of ten adults drink alcoholic beverages.
“Booze is a very generally acceptable thing.
it‘s available, and it does a very good job
on what it intends to do," explained John
Dublinski. Coordinator of Education at St.
Peter's Alcoholism Rehabilitation
Center (SPARC).

"Alcohol happens to be the most accessi-
ble and most approved drug in society,"
said Jenkins. "The attitude in society is that
it‘s not a drug."

Many positive mytlts about drinking are
continually expressed in the media. Com-
mon false beliefs say that drinking will
ruakc you mature. more manly. and more
sexually able. Another myth defines
drunkcncss as a humorous state. “TV and
movies tend to glamorizc the ‘funny
drunk‘. but in real life getting drunk is not
funny." warns the Decision Making About
Drinking tape.

Perhaps tltc most universal reason for
consuming alcohol is to relieve stress. in the
college atmosphere, stress often appears to

be the common denominator. "i don‘t
think there is any doubt that the students
today are under a lot more stress than they
used to be." Jenkins commented.

“Social life on campus is more a stressful
situation than it is an act of
enjoyment." said Dublinski. “It's a matter
of being ‘O.K."

The main reason why the effects of
alcohol are unclear in the college student is
because of his or her physical condition.
Hence, the patterns of dependency are not
readily apparent. "Their habits could be
the same as an adult, but the condition will
not show as much because of the student's
physical shape," Jenkins pointed out.

it is crucial to realize that alcoholism and
alcohol abuse. which is more common in
college students. are two different pro-
blerns.

“Alcoholism is a disease which is
primarily chronic. affecting the entire per-
son in his physically emotional. mental, and
spirtual aspects of life. And it is prone to
relapse." explained Dublinski.

For a long time. alcohol was thought of
as merely a crutch for the weak individual.
Now. the effects of alcoholism are seen in a
more complete light. “The uniqueness of
the disease is that it has sortie dcfinate
with peers or mask problems. One can
abuse alcohol on a temporary basis. It's a
one shot deal."

Whether it‘s alcoholism or alcohol abuse,
it is often difficult for anyone to realize that
they have a problem. A Middle Earth
tape called Recognizing Drinking Prob/ems
offers sortie crucial questions to the person
questioning personal drinking habits. Do
you drink to tnect people. to have a good
time, or to face difficult situations like
dates or interviews? Do you keep a bottle
handy or drink alone? These are all ques-
tions the tape suggest an individual should
ask him or herself in trying to define :1

Alcoholism cripples mind and body

particularly consider the possibility of a
drinking problem if you find that drinking
helps you to avoid or deal with stress." the
tape concluded.

Another way people are alerted about
their problem drinking is when friends and
family mention the appearance of
behavioral changes. in fact. friends and
families become so distraught over the pro-
blem drinker that they seek personal aid for
themselves.

Al-Aaon is a group which deals solely
with the people affected by the alcoholic.
"it's a family illness. Everybody who lives
with the problem drinker is affected." ex-
plained Albany District Representative for

    

 

FiaCt$ 
donor.
A 

Al-Anon Elizabeth Moore.

"We are there to improve the quality of
our own lives," said Moore. "We try to
find what it is that we can do to alter our
lives to live serenely with the active illness."

However. the emotional and spiritual
changes are not so visible. “A person has to
protect himself in his environment and with
his peers." said Dublinski. "They have to
alter their behavior and begin a process of
denial. They begin to withdraw and isolate
themselves from society. The end of isola-
tion is destructive."

“Alcohol abuse.” said Jenkins. “is the
use of alcohol which becomes a problem for
effects on the whole body." said Dublin-
sky.

The physical changes in an alcoholic are
easy to detect. according to Dublincki.
Damage to the liver, especially cirrhosis
(scarring of the liver). is readily apparent.
