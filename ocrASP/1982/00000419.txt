Renovated J. B. Scatts toreopen after blaze '

 

By Dave Mlehaelson
ATrII’I‘ WRITER

J.B. Scotts. the Central Avenue
nightclub that has beelt closed since being
engulfed by fire last July 23. is due to re-
open within the next two months. said co-
owner Vincent ilirhiglia‘.

Investigation of the blaze. which has
been attributed to arson by police. is conti-
nuing. Blrbiglia said there were no suspects
and he could only speculate on who was
responsible.

“When you're the number one club and
you're taking business away from other
places." he said. “everyone wants to see
you gone."

Extensive rcnnovation of the club is now
underway, Birbiglia said. A new roof is be--
ing constructed to cover the redesigned bar.
a new sound and lighting system has been
added. and the interior has been
redecorated. Seating capacity will increase
by about one hundred. he said.

“J.B. Scotts was dingy as far as the in-
terror was concerned." Birbiglia
lamented. “A constant complaint was that
the place was always dirty. The new interior
will be real nice."

Birbiglia called the rebuilding cost as a
"tremendous financial drain." explaining
that the club could not afford a comprehen-
sive insurance plan. iiut the landlord is
helping out with financing. he added. the
salvaged equipment has been sold. and a
settlement was reached on the insurance
they did have.

Birbiglia talked about the night-club
business. explaining that promoting per-
formers is a risky undertaking. “It's an up

and down situation." he said. "We are real
happy to break even on most acts." he said.
revealing that most profit was made at the
bar.

In the past. the club has featured Todd
Rundgren. David Crosby. the Dixie Dregs.
and John Hall. The Pretenders and Pat
Benatar appeared there early in their
careers. However. Blrbiglia quickly
pointed out that he is not running an ex-
clusive rock club. "We try to do a complete
cross-section of music. he said. mentioning
jazz and folk groups have frequently per-
formed there.

”Bands play Scotts for a lot less than
elsewhere because they love playing the

room." he said. explaining that groups like
the club's sound system. At most placesphe
pointed out. a band has to supply their own
sound system.

Birbiglia was in the retail record business
before he and partner Doug Jacobs. along
with two others. opened the club in I977.
He attributed some of J.B. Scott's success
to Jacobs' experience as a touring band
member. saying that he knows how to make
bands feel at home in the club.

' The new J.B. Scotts will feature some
changes. Shows will begin at 8:00 pm dur-
ing the week instead of 10:00 PM. so people
can get honte earlier. according to Blrbiglia.
Also. happy hour will commence at 5 pm.

Help available for alcoholism problem

that individual or any other individual."

Additionally. Dublinski said that in
alcohol abuse “the drinking is done for
some other reasons. It could be to keep up
our own lives." said Moor. "We try to ﬁnd
what it is that we can do to alter our lives to
live serenly with the active illness." '

One of the beliefs Al-Anon fosters is that
it is important to live and let live. “When
the spouse or friend no longer contributes
to the alcoholic's life. the individual will
begin to look at himself. This means to just
not participate in rescue anymore. It
doesn't mean not giving support in other
ways.“ conunented Moore.

Ai-Anon teaches its members to take the
focus off the alcoholic and put it on
oneself. Moore stated that members must
"realize you have no power over this per-

son's problem. You didn‘t cause it. you
can't control it. you can’t cure it. You must
obtain freedom for yourself."

Although Moore said. “Since the illness
is bafﬂing. the recovery is also bafﬂing."
there are active ways to help the problem
drinker recover.

“We do things ranging from condoning
to consoling." is what Jenkins explained as
the first reaction to the problem driiiker.
“We enable them to drink by giving them
excuses to do so."

According to Jenkins. one must become
assertive and get the person to see the pat-
terns of their drinking behavior. It is always
important to confront the drinking
behavior. not the individual. "When you
confront them. you are continuing to say "i
value you. i can: about you. and I don't
want to see you hurting yourself or

while MTV. the "music network" is shown

While the club is being reconstructed.
Birbiglia said they are promoting band such
as Missing Persons and The Motels at the
Palace Theatre. Scotts will start booking
acts after the roof is ﬁnished and the in-
terior redecoration has begun. He said
SUNYA’s WCDB will help promote the
reopening and described the community as
"supportive."

Birblglia concluded that the temporary
absence of J.B. Scotts has left an entertain-
ment gap in the Albany area.

"The fact that we've been closed has made
everyone realize how lucky they were to
have us.” Ci

.olhers.” Jenkins said.
