It‘s the extra-ﬁne roiling ball of Pilot's remarkable new Precise Ball Liner
Pen. (If you haven‘t guessed which one it Is. look at the top photo again.
It‘s the trim beauty on the bottom left.)
But unlike'the others. the real beauty of Pilot's Precise Ball Liner is
the extra-ﬁne line it puts on paper. It glides smoothly across the page I
because its tiny tungsten carbide ball is held securely within a needle-like
stainless steel collar. A collar that makes the Precise Bail Liner the most
\~. K durable. trouble-free rolling ball pen you can buy.
 - \ It's letter-writer‘sjoy. An artist's dream,
 A scribbler's delight.
One more ﬁne point: the Pilot Precise
Ball Liner doesn't have a big, fat
/ price. lt'sJusta skinny

tory this past weekend. will begin
their pursuit of the State Chain-
plOnShip this weekend. With a Cit-tr
rccord. Head Coach Patrick Dwycr
cxpccls his team to be ranked in the
top five of the 16 team field. This
year is the team‘s first iii the NCAA
and even if they don‘t get on invita-
tion to the NCAA Championship
Tournament, thc)‘ hitvc ulrcntly itc-
complishcd more titan cnough in

Dwycr ptit it. Donntt Clinic-t. the
team's captain, added that the
team's victory was "It foreshadow-
ing of how we'll do in the State
Championships."

Dwycr, who has coached the
team for four years. has never had tt
team finish lower than fourth in the
State Championships. By creating
an environment for his players
where they can play their best while
also enjoy playing the game. Dwyer
has gained the utmost respect from
his players. “He’s ti great coach“.
Koren Triss added. "and he treats
you like a person. not just as an
athlete." Chalet agrees. stating that
Dwycr “is an excellent coach and a
great person."

Because the Regionnl‘s and the
NCAA Championships are both in-
vitational tournaments. Dwycr is
not sure if his lctun will be given a
chance to compete iii cithcr one.
“We‘re good enough to he in thc
Rcuionals and probably will be. but
The NCAA‘s are a different story."

Dwycr stated. "Because we don‘t
get a chance to play the top teams in
this area during the regular season,
we probably won't be invited to
compete in the NCAA's Champion-
ship Tournament. biit tlicrc's
