Women harriers take fourth

By Tracey Carmichael

This weekend the Harriers show—
ed that they’re the type of team that
faces up to a challenge -— which was
exactly what the NYAIAW cross-
country championship meet at
Geneseo made them do.

Out of 16 teams. Albany's top
seven took fourth place overall.
Head Coach Ron White was more
than pleased. considering it was
their first appearance in a big con-
ference meet.

Cortland proved it was the best
team in the conference by scoring
30 points, followed by Binghamton
with 65. Hamilton just nosed tlte
Danes out of third place by seconds
with a score of 123 compared to
Albany's 128. Pluttsburgh placed
fifth overall with 162 points.

First place overall was (fortiand's
Sarah Grygul, with an uncontested
18:35. individually. Kathy McCar-
thy placed twelfth with a time of
19:48 Karen Kurthy was severi-
teenth overall with a time of 20:07
and. just seconds behind her. was
Sheoban Liriffcn with a time of
20:09. Bette Drarnbtt had a time of
20:53 and took thirty-third and Kim
Patch was forty-eight out of ninety-
eight runners with a time of 21:33.

White was' surprised that the
team finished so high because of the
slow start they had. Part of the pro-
blem. according to Kurthy. was the
“hilly” surface of the course. "We
started out slow, but we picked up
ground. The gap was just too wide
between our third. fourth and fifth
r u n n c r s . ' '

Overall. Kurthy was pleased with
her time and the team's perfor—
mance. Wiritc added. “Considering
we started out slow, placing within
