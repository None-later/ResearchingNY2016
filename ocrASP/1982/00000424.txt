Danes wln ~

«Back Page

Albany had a final opportunity in
the ﬁrst half when tight defense
forced Saxon head coach Sam
Sanders to try a quick kick attemp-
ting to pin the Danes deep in their
own territory. Law retreated into
punting formation while defensive
back Dave Hardy prepared to
receive the ball. The strategy ap-
peared to work as Law’s punt
traveled 42 yards bouncing off Har-
dy's shoulder and rolling all the way
to the Albany two-yard line. llut
Hardy chased after it. and once he
had possession. he proceeded to
break 35 yards rrpfleld shaking off
several lacklers rrs he wertt.

“They had a shot gun formation
that tltey kicked out of." said l-lar-
dy. "I had a problem handling it
but then i was alright."

But the Danes failed to score,
leaving the halftime totals at 7-7.

Neither team could rmrster that
much offense in the third quarter.
“it was a battle between two tough.
tough defenses and two semi-
competent offenses." described

I-‘ord.

A fumble recovery by Dunc Scott
Michaels opened the way for
another potential score. The Danes
took control at the Alfred 32-yard
line. l.iley dropped back to pass on
first down and, as he eyed the ac-
tivity in the secondary, 6'4"
ZED-pound linebacker Mickey
Smith came around end ac-
celerating for 30 yards and blind-
sided the young quarterback with
perhaps the hardest hit delivered all
season in an Albany football game.
l.iley hardly moved for several
minutes, laying very still on the
ground. He was forced to leave the
game with an injured shoulder.
Ford went to his third quarterback
of the day, Roth, to lead the charge.
He carried the ball to tire Alfred
34-yard line.

Ford then gave Lincoln the third
rtod of the afternoon to atterrrpt a
record—breaking 51-yard boot. The
kicker sent the ball long enough btrt
it sailed just wide right of the
uprights.

But l.incoln more than cornpcn»
stticd for his three previous failures
by giving the Danes the lead at 7:27
of the fourth quarter. Roth had
found Brien for a 15-yard gain to
move into long field goal range. It
was llrien's third reception of the
game. Lincoln was asked to boot a
40-yarder and he did.

The Danes played the remainder
of the game against the clock. th
Albany did survive a scare when
Johnson tried a 31-yard field goal
with just 4le left to play. The Sas-
on kicker missed again and Albany
took possession. This tirnc the
Danes were able to run the clock
down to under a minute before
returning the football to Alfred. [J

Buffalo next

<Back Page

Karwath noted that the Buffalo
secondary is a young one that has
proved , itself against the pass.
“We’re going to hope that we can
work the wishbone against them,"
said Karwath.

The Bulls 4-3 record is a bit
deceiving. Buffalo has played some
top quality Division lll opponents.
Most notably the Bulls faced the na-
tion's number one team. Baldwin-
Wallace of Cleveland, losing 31-26.

“it should be a great game to
watch, an aerial showcase. They use
the same offense as the Bills and
evon wear the same uniforms," said
Karwath of Saturday's contest. D
