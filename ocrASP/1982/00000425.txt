The Albany State men's soccer
team concluded their season with a
disappointing 3-2 loss to North
Adams on Saturday. The loss was

the Danes' season compressed into .

90 minutes.

It was a season that had started
out so promising. Albany was
undefeated after three games, in-
cluding a hard fought come-from-
behind victory over state-ranked
Piattsburgh.

The North Adams game started
out so promising. Albany jumped
out to a quick i-O lead over the
Mohawks as senior John Markcs
scored a goal on a pass from Jerry

’, lsaacs at 11:20. lsaacs. a constant

bright spot in what was sometimes a
dim season, controlled the ball
along the sidelines. dribbled past a
defender and sent a pass into the

penalty box. Markes blasted the
ball past goalie Tom Lynch. it was
the second goal in as many games
for Markes, who closed out his four
year career at Albany on University
Field Saturday.

As one of the Danes' co-captains,
Markes will be hard to replace, ac-
cording to Head Coach Bill Schief-
felin. “His leadership will be greatly
missed. He was a real hustler. a
solid player." he said. "He was a
good example for the younger
players." Schieffelin felt that
Albany would miss the ag-
gressiveness of the Danes' other
senior. Paul Aspland.

A season of promise quickly
turned into a season of disappoint-
ment and frustration. The Danes,
suffering from both physical and
mental exhaustion from the tough
Plattsburgh win, dropped a 44)
decision to highly ranked Cortland.

ties with Brockport and Potsdam
and a loss at Union.

“Potsdam and Union were the
low-points of the season," said
Markes. “But the one thing In at

that part of the season as the most
disappointing.

Springfield beats women boaters

By Howard Beech
srAI-‘i- WRITER

It usually doesn‘t matter what
sport it is.When a nationally ranked
Division ll team meets a young
Division ill team, the results are
predictable. On Saturday, Spr-
ingfield College. Head Coach Amy
Kidder's alma mater, came to
Albany and defeated the women
hooters 4-0.

The Maroons struck late in the
first half, when Suc Sarafino hit
Cathy Jenkins with a strike ending
in goal number one. Just minutes
earlier Springfield was penalized for
offsidcs costing them their original
score. The ﬁrst half was played
almost evenly with Springfield
holding the occasional advantage.
A hustling defense, and some real
determination by Karen Smith on a
Springfield breakaway saved the
Danes from what would have been
a sure goal.

The Danes experienced first half
difficulties offensively when Spr-
ingfield showed Albany something
new. By dropping deeper in
Albany's end, the Maroon sweeper-

 

backs cut down Dunc
maneuverability forcing thct to
hold the ball longer than they would
have liked. .

Springfield wasted no time ig-
niting thc offense that elevated
them to an eleventh place ranking in
the nation. With the second half
not three minutes old. the second of
Springfield's four goals found its
way past Cathy Russo's lunging
arms. Jenkins broke through the
confusion in front of the Albany
net to find Denise chlcr‘s pass.
and converted her second goal of
the afternoon.

The third goal coming at 25
minutes of the second half was
typical of the day. Springfield‘s
goalie, Sheryl Sullivan found the
Dane transition game off-guard
with a long boot to midfielder Kim
Miles, who put the ball past Russo,
unassisted.

With five minutes having expired
since Mile's goal, Jcnnifir Wilson
scaled the victory for the visiting
Maroons when she helped Lisa
O'Neili's pass find a home in
Albany‘s net.

When the women‘s varsity soccer
tcam concludes their season this
year, it Is unlikely that they will see
championship action. Lowering
their record to 6-5-1. the Danes
have finished this season and will
soon turn their attention to next
year. But this was a solid year for a
team whom many thought to be too
young and inexperienced. Saturday
wasn't the game the Danes wanted
to play.

“The shots were there. we had
our chances. but it just didn‘t hap-
pen for us." Kidder acknowledged.

Next year Amy Kidder will pur-
sue the goal that was a year away
this year —— hcr shot at a state cham-

39:50. A Derion cornerkick was put
into the net by Mike DeMorriss at
43:41, as again the Danes were
unable to clear the area in front of
goalie Tom Merritt.

Albany made a resurgence late in
‘he season winning two of four,
with the two defeats being heart-
breakers at the hands of highly
regarded opponents. The wins over
Siena and Vassar were unim-
pressive. The focus of this four
game segment was on the losses.
Frustration is the word that best
describes this period. Hard luck and
not getting breaks. terms usually us-
ed by i05ing teams. certainly apply
to the Danes. A mistake by stan-
dout defensive player Michael
Miller cost Albany the game with
Binghamton. Miilcr keyed the
defense. which played with a good
amount of consistency throughout
the season. The loss to Onconta
featured several shots by the Danes
hitting the post and bounding out.
while Onconta scored one of their
.wo goals on a ball that hit the post
and went in.

Albany made a resurgence in the
second half. A minute and four
seconds into the second period,
John lssclharti scored the prettiest
goal of the season. it was a picture
perfect goal. lssclhard heading .1
free kick from lsaacs into the net.

Sparkcd by the goaltending of
backup Lance Harvey and the tying
goal from lssclhard, Albany
tlominatcd play the rest of the way.
Harvey made several saves denying
what appeared to be goals to the
Mohawks. The Dane comeback
seemed to be complete with is
minutes left in the game. Following
a foul. Terry Bacchus sent a free
kick high into the air and in front of

player on the ﬁeld at 6'5" hit the
ball squarely with his forehead. For
an instant the ball appeared to have
disappeared into the net for the go-
ahead goal. But the Danes chance
for victory was thwarted as Lynch
just managed to slap the ball away.

North Adams came back down
the field and a corner kick by
Remillard sailed across the goal
mouth. Harvey came out to get it,
but Kyle White beat him to the bail
and headed it into the net for the
final score. The Danes despite
pressure in the Mohawk end were
unable to even the score and force
the game into overtime. Dorian
Fanfare summed up the team's leci-
ing. "i just don't believe it."

With two games remaining on
their schedule, RN and North
Adams. Albany had a chance to
avert a losing season. A win and a
tie or two victories would keep
Schicffclin‘s 12 year streak alive.
This chance was stolen from ilicm
in Troy. when pitiful referccing
gave the game to the Engineers, 2-l.
Albany cntcrcd Saturday's game
with North Adams. confident. The
feeling was, perhaps the team
would have that offensive explosion
they were expecting all year. The
Danes dominated play. but were
unable to put the bail in the net.

The inability to score plagued
Albany all season long. Five times
the team was shutout. Albany
created plays very well. and on
many occasions they controlled the
tempo of the game. lsaacs and Bac-
chus were especially instrumental in
the Dane offense, creating
numerous scoring chances. The
problem was. the ’Dancs were
unable to cash in on their chances.
“We could not finish off our plays.
Thch was a lack of intensity." said
