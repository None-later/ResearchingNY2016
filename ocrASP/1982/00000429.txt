State trooper recruits trained and
taught at nearby police academy

By Bill Brewster

It‘s six a.rtr. Time to get up. Yor
ttllit‘kly get dressed and join other
classtitates in a morning run. After
yort finish. there's breakfast and an
etitire day iirtensely scheduled with
academic lectures. specialized
classes and self-defense lessons.
When classes are over and official
work is finished. you have to eat
dinner and study, but that takes
awhile and soon it's time for bed.
You and your roommate make sure
your room is lit inspection order
and you turn in knowing that the
same routine awaits you tomorrow.
the day after. and every day for the
next 23 weeks.

Where are you? West Point?
('arnp l.ejune'.’ Lacklarid AFB?
Alcatraz? Not quite.

Yort're just a few hundred yards
from SUNYA at the New York
State Police Academy, training base
for potetttial New York State
troopers.

Located across l’critrietcr Road
Iroirr State Qiirid's parking lot. the
grayiin tlttcc story building was
coriiplctcd iti May 1970 by tltc State
()t't'icc of (icttcral Services to be us-
cd t'or ttttittitlg of new troopers.
\‘incc their. the academy has been
c\patidcd lor all sorts of training

the dormitories, made up of

relatively small. is still ttrodertt and

"We just stagger meal hours
when all the troopers can't fit."
\\'achcnheitn said. “We tirade it so
the troopers could remain inside for
traitritrg if necessary."

Other sections ot' the acadctiiy in-
clude a small museum derotcd to
State Trooper artifacts arid a full

cupied primarily with the State
Police's mounted past. A large
statue of a trooper on horseback

of the old pictures and antiques. in-
cluding sortie weapons of old for
both good guys and bad.

ting tools are a part of the facility.
but are irscd only for recreation
after a session of Work and study.

To be eligible to attend the
academy, the booklet states that a
recruit must be between 2| and 2‘)
years old. have a liigh school
diploma. (although over 50 percent
of recruits have attended college).
and take a state-wide two and otte-
half hour written competitive exam.
Last year 30.000 applied for the
test. and 18.000 took it.

. Wachenheitn said.

A physical rind medical exam is
then conducted to gauge a potential
recruit's ability to perform
necessary job-related tasks.
Wriehenheitn said. There are no
longer any height or weight re.
quircmcnts. but an examiiree must
pass the tests successfully regardless
of any disadvantages.

A felony or series of illegal activities
will ruin any chances of attaining a
State Trooper positioti.

Alter all these tests are ad-
ministered and the results are in. an
oral interview is conducted and the
prospective recruit, if successful
throughout the proce. is placed on
an official waiting list. When a new
class opens in the academy. ISO-200
people are called from the list and
are ordered to report for training.
Wachenhcirn explained.

 

The academy training itself is the
final step and consists ol' 23 weeks
of intensive academic and physical
instruction in preparation for a
trooper career. Classes in drug cri-
forcement, legal awareness. and
many other job-related subjects are
the main portion of training, accor-
ding to the booklet. Usually.

are the best qualified in the state

problems are not very wide-spread.
according to Wachcnheim. This is
the primary result of the long
testing arid screening period. be ad-
dcd.

l'he sctccttittg process for recruits
has been an on-going concern of tire
State Police since the early l970‘s to
separate the qualified from the in-
competent. according to the
booklet. A strong rccrnititig drive
coupled with a new federal court
order requiring that 40 percent of
all new recruits be black or
Hispanic. ten percent be female.
and 50 percent be male eaucasian or
otherwise has helped make the most
recent training classes both talented
arid balanced.

The process and the training are
difficult and long. but the
academy’s efforts have made the
New York State Police. in Gover-
nor llugli (‘arey's words. “the most
highly trained police officers iii the
country." i l
