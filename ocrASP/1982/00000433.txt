Record Co-op sells 80 albums on a good day

Presently. tltere are its students
participating itt tltc outfit. As a
rule. it member must work- an hour
a week per semester attd pay a $5
membership fee (when ltc/shc signs
up. in exchange for this fee. each
member is ctttitlcd to a 'l'-sltirt or
the choice of a $5.98 album.

Members cite tltc extra 9 pcrccttt
discount all records. sales skills. an
informal altttospltcre, and a new
knowledge of musicians as advan-
tages of working at the Record (‘n-
op.
Sittce tlte Co-op is an non-profit
organization. every pcttny made
goes back into the record line.

I’olcltctti says the (Tn-op docs fairly

The Record ("o-op‘s checkng

year's Icto approbation hudch for
lllc Coop's spending was $53,000.
This year it has increased to
$55,650, dttc to tire extra cost oi

upon the music industry."

A few years ago. the University
attempted to close down the Co-op
and use the extra space as a lounge.
With the support of SA. tltc Co-op
was permitted to cortlinue servicing
students.

to date, the Record (To-op has
been running smoothly after taking
care of back taxes.

Aside from marketing records.
the ('()<t)p stocks record care pro-
ducts and blank tapes. They
presently are considering
distributing buttons representing
several different music groups.

Manager Doug Wolf stated
special orders for records are taken

if a student is unable to meet his
needs with the present selection. He
claims they generally receive I15 per-
cent ol‘ tltc records requested based
on availability in the selection
books.

Many students are ttndcr the im-
pression the L‘o-op is affiliated with
the ()ll-Ctllilplls radio station.
WEDB. The only correlation bet-
ween tltc two is that the Coup has
done promotions with \\’(,’l)ll, such
as providing record discounts on
the albums associated with current
concert bands or selling tickets.

One non-member student corn-
mentcd tltal ltc thought the Co-op's
prices here relatively standard when
comparing other sales — “But there
are great prices and a good selection
for the cut-outs of older rock
groups."
