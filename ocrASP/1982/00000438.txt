By Dean lletz

A byline strike by Albany Times Union
atrd Knickerbocker News reporters tItat
began last week is part of a campaign to
reach a spccdy settlement with the
newspapers‘ parent company. according to
ttrtion members.

chorters - wlro alottg with editors,
trtrck drivers. advertising salespeople and
maintenance workers have been working
without a contract since Aug. 1 - began
withholding their bylincs from stories last
week.

The bylint.‘ strike 'was a new step for the
340-member Local 34 of The Newspaper
Guild. according to an editor at the Capital
Newspapers (iroup who asked not to be
identified. He said that the (iuild and
Capital Newspapers "usually settle within a
year after negotiations start. but now (the
(tuild) is trying to speed things up" by
pressuring the company with tactics such as
the byline strike.

(itrild members have also set a Nov. 21
dcadlittc for a dccision by rrniorr leadership
whether l'urthcr job actions —inc|uding a
strikc ~ will be considered.

Iltc union is asking for a ll percent pay
increase. seniorin protection. increased job

program. 'I Itc cttrrcttt pay scale for (irrild
rncttrbers runs from $252.75 a week to $382.
Some tccicye higher pay due to tneril In-
creases. 'l he editor said that increases try the
(irtild contracts. witiclr are negotiated every
four years. have averaged seven pcrccttt in
the past scvcrttl contracts.

said that his sympathies lie with the trtrion.
"I would like to see the new contract settled
in the old corttract's time." ltc said. and ex-
plained w by Capital Newspapers delays
negotiations. “The longer a company can
hold off a raise they've already budgeted
I'm. the more interest they can make on that
tnoncy. The (iuild doesn‘t ltayc enough
leverage to settle ilte contract sooner.“ he
said. adding that the byline strike was a
legal way of increasing its leverage by

Manley addresses audience

<Front Page

Manley's party was topplcd like many
others because. “he is a brillant leader btrt
there were dishonest people working for
hitrt with their hands in the till."

The recent I980 elections on the stnali
island were wrought with violence in wltich
750 people were killed. "This hurt our
tourism trade. people were afraid to travel
to the island.“ Manley obscrycd. but he
countered criticism that his government was
trying to shut ottt American tourists: "My
administration worked \cry hard to in—
crease tourism. it is l5 percent of our
GNP."

Concerning campaign \iolcncc. Manley
said that "the opposition party played a
rough game ." hut hc was assttt'cd by Henry
Kissinger that thc CIA was playing no part
in any sort ol~ destabili/atiott of his govertv
tttcttt. he stated. lilection \iolence has been
part of Jamaican ltislttt)’ sIthc [940. he
said. “There ltas always been a \iolcnt rift
between the Socialist and tire Democratic
parties irt tltc country."

“No people are going to accept domina-
tion by others. Manley dcclarctl. pounding
his list on the podittrtt. artd dctnartdirrg that

“apartheid must be destroyed and buried
ill South Al‘rica." Manley has been a reci-
picrtt ot' a United Nations (told Medal for
his el'l'orts to combat apartheid in Sotrtlr
Africa.

He broadcned the issue by saying that ol'
all the politicians irc talked during his reign.
"Not one from anywhere in the world
could he find that was willing to take a
stand against apartheid." ilis \icws corn»
pcllcd cnthtrsiastic applause from the
predorrrirtrrrttly black audience.

Manley urged his attdicncc to increase
their awareness of U.S. attd ittlct national
politics. “When you students trtrn your
backs on political action you Icrryc it to
tnctliocracy. this is a great tragedy for a
great country.“ Ire said. He hated that
economic problems are worldwide and e\-
prcssctl dismay tltat such rt country ol
technological adyartccmcut could corttitrrrc
to "borrow its way irtto debt." Ilc pointed
