dorm fee hike is avoided. Tierney pointed
to the DOB as tltc real villain iii the
budgetary process. rcpetttcdly accusing the
division of ignoring educational priorities
and treating SUNY in terms of only dollars
and cents.

"The DOB doesn't think much  of the
Board of Trustees." Tierney helleves."The
Board feels the DOB ignores them as the

authority of SUNY." He asserted that the _

DOB exerts "financial harrassment" on
SUNY.

SASU Vice President Scott Wexlcr sees a
tuition increase as "an absolute reality. The
state has a tremendous deficit and SUNY is
requesting six percent more than last year.
It's obvious they‘re looking for a tuition in-
crease." Wexler warned that as I983 is not
art election year and there was no tuition in-
crease last year. “the time is right. But no
one's going to say anythirtg yet."

Deputy Chief Budget Examiner for the
DOB Alex Rollo said he could not comment
on a tuition increase. and denied the DOB
exerted financial harrassment on SUNY.
"We can only make rccormnendations. It‘s
up to the Board of Trustccs to make up the
budget." he said.

SUNY Director of Finance Harry K.
Spindler also forwarded “no comment" on
tlte tuition increase. “The state has a
serious fiscal problem." Spindler stated.
“It will be up to the new governor to
decide. ultimately."

SASU has already begun appealing to
Cuorno on the budget. “We feel we have a
friend in Cuomo." Tierney said. "We gave

 

him a lot of support and he may feel he
owes us something."

chler has contacted Andy Cuomo. the
governor's son and head of the administra-
tion's transition team. to organize a
meeting of SASU and new officials. Also.
Tierney said SASU plans to lobby the

NOVEMBER [2. I982 ' ALBANY STUDENTPRESS 7

Legislature in I983 to voice their disap-
proval.

The budget is “a battle that could extend
Into early .Iuly." warned Tierney. “Often
it's who screams the lottdest who gets
heard. We‘ve been screaming about the tui-
tion increase to the DOB.“ ‘

Cheating: truth or consequences

<Fronl Page

Student Conduct. Henry Kirschner. is also
concerned about academic dishonesty at
SUNYA.

“It‘s at the heart of the institution. It a
student catt cheat his way through. the
degree means less to all of us". Is’irschner
said and he agreed that "defining the pro-
blem Is important." .

Kirschner explained the judicial process
that occurs when a faculty member of .stu-
dent suspects someone of cheating. First. he
said. a teacher has the option of ignoring
the incident. or dealing with it himself. If a
case is referred to the university judicial
system. it will end up before thc Committee
on Student Conduct. This committee hears
all cases considered to be of a serious
rtattrre. according to the 198244] Student
Guidelines. Stttley said the corrttuittcc views
cheating as "ranking with assault on peo-
ple. as something a university cannot
tolerate." If a student is found guilty.
penalty can range from a letter of warning
to dismissal from the unitcrsity.

One of the problems faced by the corn—

tnittce is the philosophical question ol‘
whether or not there are different degree.
ofcheating. When deciding on actions to be
taken against offenders. tlte answer is
generally yes. Staley said. He adtuittcd that
realistically. very few cases ever get referred
and only six to eight people have been
dismissed over the last few years.

As one Albany student poinch out.
“Cheating on one or two exams cart change
a person‘s entire life." by making their cunt
just high enough to get into the business
school. Ilc added. "there are sortie classes
I'd be terrified to cheat in. because the pro-
fessor had complete control of the class."

Students ttttd faculty seem to lune a lot to
stty about the subiect of acatlcmic dishones—
t). .ts csidcnccd by last year‘s conference
arid the continued interest llIis ycar. But.
I’ar'rcll poinch out. the new program being
developed by CAFE to proruotc awareness
of cheating is still in its beginning stages.
and a third step will be a coutiattation of
discussion attd review. rtot only ~within tlrc
contmittec. but among students as well.

Nuclear awareness

<3
50 percent of which are submarines.

Members of NYPIRG feel that money
used in the military would be better spent
elsewhere. In I982. 64 percent ofthe budget
goes to the military and to pay off past war
debts according to DeVIdo. In addition. the
same one billion dollars which when used in
the military creates 76,000 jobs, would
create over l20.000 if it were used in the inv
I‘rastructurc. DeVido said. These military
jobs do not create employment for the
average blue-collar worker. said DeVido.
but require a more educated and specialized
workforce.

Besides NYPIRG. another group — The
Comnton Cause Nuclear Arms Alert Net-
work # is working on a “sustained and in-
Iensisc lobbying campaign" in order to br-
ing political pressure on the President and
Congress to end the nuclear arms race.

According to a pamphlet published by
the Knolls Action Coalition. a volunteer
group oraani/cd around the nuclear issue irt
I979. official US. policy used to rest on a
“balance of terror." which meant that the
lJ.S. was able to retaliate with an attack so
desttslttling that art ertcrny would be deter-
red from attacking.
