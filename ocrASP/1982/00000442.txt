‘ means that even If there Is attach-
ment don't fight with It. Be at-
tached. but be a witness also.

Hubert—Kenneth Dickey

Let the attachment be there: don't fight
with it. Frustration will come of course. so
be frustrated. But be a witness also. You
were attached. and you were a witness.
Now the frustration has come. and you
know well that It had to come. Now be
frustrated. but be a witness. Then through
attachment. attachment is consumed. and
through frustration. frustration Is consum-
ed.

Try this when you feel miserable. Bt
miserable: don't fight with It. Try this. It is
wonderful. When there Is misery and you
feel miserable. close your doors and be
miserable. Now what can you do? You are
miserable. so you are miserable. Now be
totally miserable. Suddenly you will
become aware of the misery. And If you try
to change It you will never become aware.
because your effort your energy. your con-
sciousness Is directed toward change.
toward how to change this misery. Then
you start thinking about how it came and
what to do now to change It. Then you are
missing a very beautIful experience — the
misery itself.

Now you are thinking about the causes
and you are thinking about the conse-
quences and you are thinking about the
method for how to forget It. how to go
beyond It. and you are missing misery
Itself. and misery Is there and that can be
liberating. Just don't do anything. Don't

Life is change. Even the Himalayas are Changing,
so your misery cannot be unchanging. It will
change by itself, and you will see that it is
changing- that. it is-disappearing and is going
away, and you feel unburdened and you have

not done anything.

analyze how the misery Is created; don't
think about what consequences are going
to be. They will follow. so you can see later
on. There Is no haste. Be miserable. simply
miserable. and don't try to change It.

Try this: see for how many minutes you
can remain miserable. You will start
laughing about the whole thing; the whole
thing will look stupid: because If you are
totally miserable. suddenly your center is
beyond misery. That center can never be
miserable; it is Impossible! if you remain
with the misery. the misery becomes
background. and you center which can
never be miserable suddenly rises above.
and then you are miserable and you are
not miserable: the “same unsame." Now
you are consuming misery through misery.
This is what ls meant: you are not doing
anything; you are simply consuming
misery through misery. Misery will disap-
pear as clouds disappear. and the sky will
be open and you will be laughing. and you
have not done anything. And you cannot
do anything. All that you can do will create
more confusion and more misery.

Who has created this misery? You. and
now you are trying to change it. It will get
worse. You are the creator of the misery.

:lothes. makeup. hairstyle. etc.. make the

of design houses for everything from even-

— appear Is the most fundamental part of

may be Judged on their intellect. business

50 what? you may ask. So — there's a
double standard at work here. with major
implications. Men are not Judged by the
way they look. They are Judged by who

basis of appearance —-| often to the exclu~

John Berger (In Ways 0/ Seeing) has
said that men act, while women appear;
men are active. dynamic. effective. and
women are passive static. Ineffective. We
spend so much time and energy worrying
about how we look, and how other people
(mainly men — after all. they're the ones
we're supposedly out to attract) perceive
us. that we have title tIrpe or inclination for

Dove Tall
We have been cast to this craggy shore

Our olive-strewn Island

where we feed off fat of myths _
and darted safe 'neath néctar sky
has left us.

lts marble porticos
have sunk Into brine deeper
than Atlantis

And now. on slate shore
we sweep from one scrub pine
to the next;

Southwest winds cut to our bones
as we forage beach plums.
blood purple berries.

  
 

And here. In fork
of unyielding spike branches.
a nest.

We keep vigil.
rive poise. still
as porcelain.

poetry:

To Geoffrey. My Brother

Who at night is not here.
by Brother of two eyes.
and smiles

wide as country vistas from hills
or deep sorrows enough
enough to curtain a moon

Smiles or sorrows that come
as lightning comes
even when the storm is foretold.

At our dinner table. like a dog within a sparrow.
flapping his wings at my Father.
flapping his wings at my Mother.

his wings flapping children wide eyed.

“You have had your back seat rides."
“You have had your nights of dreams."
“You have seen without eyes. darkness."
He has called. and called. yet

no one will pluck those feathers from him.

My Brother stands before our table.
his arms like wings. folded. in flight refused.
his two eyes cocked upon a sun sinking

a moon night rising.

And since there is no room
his dog soul to fly In my Father's house
like those spring sparrows into corner cobwchs
or grey windows
or low church rafters

Yes. since there is no room
he comes to me with simple hands and says
“Because I want to love all this
forever.
and m w- say why."

That well-worn buckskin Jacket
Flung over the end of my bed
Some remnant of temporary shelter
From the winds of isolation

Blowing us together—prairie grass
in the open desert of dreams.

Of mud cracking In mid-day heat.
Echoing hoofbeats of your departure.
The Indentation on the quilt
Reflected In the azure sunset

Holds the warmth of blttr nights
Clinglng to shreds of fantasy.

There is sagebrush In the cupboard
And no one sits at the oak table
You made for me that afternoon.
Dust settles. preserving your shadow

his past Saturday. poets gathered at the New York State Museum to
participate In Family Fun Addicts Day. Several locations throughout the
Museum were designated for poetry readings. including the Port.
Sesame Street and the Wigwam. People. wandering through the exhibits would
pause and listen to unknown and well-known poet alike. No one seemed to dif-
ferentiate, and young and old alike seemed to be surprised at their enjoyment of
this event. Poetry Is not normal fare for most people, but the Museum is making

an effort to familiarize people with the unfamiliar. including oral reading of

The poetry read was all original work read by its author. Among the tttany
poets present was a group of SUNYA poets who in the past year have studied
oral reading of poetry with Professor Thomson Littlefield of the SUNYA English
Department. Prof. Littlefield teaches the Linklater method. a combination of
breathing and vocal stretching exercises which "free the natural voice". The
point of this exercise is to allow the poet to more freely and naturally read his or
her own work as well as the work of others,

Featured here are examples of the work of this particular group of poets. Their
work has appeared in Tangent and Nadir as well as other Journals. All these

v were part of the Saturday readings.

in silence

but alone. at night

l'd search the rooms

while they. in theirs

searched the silence.

her hollow eyes dug Into my senses
and reality was spilled;

escape became swollen with lies—
language had no refuge.

silence had no image.

awareness was no choice.

lll. Running through dirty streets
I came upon an old man
humming to himself

he sensed my presence behind
and ceased his song.

i wanted to scream ‘Don't Stop'
for as he turned around

l recognized my father's face.
Pushing my way Into his arms
he shattered

and then there was a silence
while a siren screamed in the
darkness of the daylight

He laughed and laughed
and couldn't stop laughing.
