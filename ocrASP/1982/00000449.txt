When it comes to tie subject of
lntramurals. most members of tire
trniversity population assume that
the intramural program is run by
the Association of Men's In-

will he startittg.

Last month WIRA ran a racquet-
hall tournarttent. ’fhe tottrnarnent
which cortsistcd of fottr ditisions
proved to be exciting. suspenseful
attd full of tension. It also was a lot
of fun. an aspect which has been a

numerous irttramtrral progratns. In the women‘s beginners divi-

there is anotlter organi/ation that
also runs intramurals. They are the;
Women's Intramural and Recrea-
tion Association or more commonly
know as WIRA. WIRA. which is
run by President Eve Iloerncr. is
responsible for running all co-cd
and women's itttrarntrral activities.

"We are iii the shadow ot'AMIA.
but we are trying to implctttent as
many new programs as possible."
said Ilocrncr.

In order to find otrt what pro-
grams are popular Hoerncr and her
staff handed out 600 surveys. The
results of this sttrvcy were that soft-
ball. raquctlrall. soccer. terntis and
tire introduction to the weight room
program were most popular.
Iloerner hopes to start more of the
sports that the university popula-
tion wants.

For Hocrttcr. the job of president
hasn't been all that easy. Site took
over the position from Michele
Johnston. According to Hoerncr.
Johnston was a good WIRA presi-
dent. but she had problems working
well with the AMIA president.

Hoerncr took over and increased
the WIRA council from seven to
[3 members. Also added to the staff
was Mary Warner in the position of
WIRA ndvisor. “Mary Warner
helps us out a lot. she is very en-
thusiastic." Hocrncr said. Hoerncr
further pointed out that she works
hand in hand with AMIA president
Mike Brusco.

For WIRA the 1982 fall semester
has been going rather well. In the
next few weeks. volleyball. basket-
ball. water polo and floor hockey

The Albany State men‘s \stestling team takes it's act on the road for
the first time this season. Coming off their teartt championship in the
(itcat Dane ('lassic last weekend. tltc Danes trasel to Syracuse for the
Syracuse Open today and Saturday.

Among the missing are Vic Herman and Andy Scras. Herman. one

meet qualifies the winners for the American team that will travel to
Russia to compete in the internationally known Tblisi Tournament.

\\'ar'e feels the learn has a "better than fair chance" at the Syracuse
()pcn. "We‘re not not tied about tetttn scores because we‘re rot taking
a fttll squad.“ he said. “Most of the guys sltotrld place. csccpt for
I’apo (Riscra) possibly. because he is only a freshman."

Syracuse pros ed to be tough competitors last week. Arriving at the

hopeful Hocrner said.

As for AMIA, Hoerncr explain-
ed. "I would like both organiza-
tions to work together but yet. stay
independent of each other. We
want people to realize we exist."

"They are working harder than
ever, | credit that to Eve. It’s great
to see them coming into their own."
commented llrusco.
