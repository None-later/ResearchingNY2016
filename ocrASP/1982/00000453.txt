Art r.pcct oi Jim‘s lifestyle ltas set ltittt apart from the
test of society. He has chosen a patlt known to be feared
and wider ttnstmtlcrstood by his fellow citi/cns. Jim is a
homosexual.

cautioti lie takes in living witlt his sexual preference.
“People will be physically or verbally abusivcjtlsl hccausc
\UIIICUHL' is a homosexual or lesbian." ltc said.

The terttt lIoIno/I/Iolriu ltas beett given '
to those people who have art irrational 
fear of gay Inert and women. “llomoscx- 
uality isn't ttccceptcd because it's
threatening. it is tltrcatening to the social 
structure and tire s‘cx roles that ltave been set up for chI-
tttrics." explained liliraheth Britt. a member of the (fray
arttl Lesbian Alliattce (GALA) steering committee.

Acccording to .loe Norton. a gay cottnselor and
SUNYA professor of educational psychology.
hotnopltobia is indeed ltighly correlated willt rigid value
strttctttres. He also explained lltat sotnc of tire roots of
homophobia stem front many tnyths associated with
homosexuality arid lesbianism.

Nortoti said an example of these tttytlts is “that gay
men want to be women anti lesbians want to be men. Yet
the tttytlt also says that all gay tnctt hate wontcrt arid all
lesbians hate men."

Martha l’itch. coordinator of the catttptts sexual
resource cctttct (icncsis. provides attotlter factor itt socie-
ty's hornopltobic attittttlc. "I believe that people's biggest
fcar itt homosexuality is that they will be enliccd arttl
hccottic involved." said I‘itch. “It's not wltat they expect
of themselves. It is not the way they defittc themselves."

Often when dcfittitig the homosexual relationship. peo-
ple will minimirc all other parts of the relationship besides
the sexual aspect. "l’eoplc thittk of gays as merely sexual
bcirtgs and don't realize that they‘re also workers.
volunteers. teachers. and mothers," said Norton.

" People don't usually define thertrsclvcs as to wltat they
do itt bed. And for a lot of gay people it's pretty rnttclt the

 

 

 

 

 

satire thing." ttotcd Britt.

in fact. many gay men and women see homosexuality
as a part of life rather than a complete waon life. “I look
at myself as hcittg a pctson first," Jim said.

"The point is that lesbians and guys are just like other
people with the cxception of their sexual orientation, and
they need to be thought of as people." Norton said.

However. the mere fact that homosexuals atttl lesbians
do have a different sexual orientation has been a dill‘icull
reality for society to grasp. Matty Itctetoscxuals hasc dil-
ficttlty understanding how physical attraction cart exist
between members of the same sex. “ They can't ercn look
at the homosexual corrplc and say isn‘t lore wonderful. as
they would \then lookirtg at a heterosexual couplc.“ said
Fitch.

ltt spite ot the fact that homosexuality is ltrmncd upon
by the majority of society. tett percent ol the popttlatiott
has chosen to be gay, according to Norton. lltis decision
is one that takes many gay men arid wotticti years to
make.

Lesbians and guys are just like other people

. society has gi\cn to them." she said.

F————.'——'——"l
Gays and lesbians face homophobic society '

have to explore."

Britt noted the high degree of equality women ex-
pericttce iii the lesbian relationship. "Basically. in a les-
bian society. the women are more free. There is also more
ftccdorn for the rttcti because they can step out ofthc roles

The lrcctlom experienced through being guy that Britt
desttibes has certainly been explored by many members
of society. It is through explaining this frccdom attd other
posili\c parts of the gtl)’ lifestyle that homosexuals and
lesbians hope to begin ctttitig tltc “social disease" of
homophobia.

“A key to tire cute is to become aware of one's own
sexuality. This can help eliminate tltc fear of enticement."
said litclt.

"The best care for homophobia is to get to knovt gays
and lesbians." stated Norton. “llut in the less personal
scnsc. one can be helped through rcadittg and study."

Tltis ptoecss of self exploration airls itt defining what a
gay person is rtrtd what a gay person is not. “So an occa-
sional homosexual incident tltltrx rtot make a pctsott

most adolescents who "play around" with one another
still grow tip to bc heterosexual.

Aside from the sexual standpoint. many women assert
that their lesbianism has a political reality as well. “l’co-
ple have to be more aware of the political ramifications of
our sexual choice.“ said Student Association Media

Nuke accelerator spins atomic explorations

 

By Melissa Jaehii

Nttclcar power is a cotttrov sial issue
tltcsc days, bttt many people may not reali/c
that there is a little bit of “nuke” ltcrc at
this university. The basctttcnt belwccti the
Biology rind Earth Science harbors
SUNYA's nuclear accelerator. used for
research atid tcaclting purposes.

“This is a unique tttachinc iii the sense
that it is a high current machine arid its
resolution is extremely good." commented
Accelerator Director islassaram Bakhru,
who has been working on the accelerator
since its construction in 1970. “it is very
well suited to doing experiments itt solid
state. atomic. and nuclear physics."

Bakhru was previously in charge of a
“much bigger machine." as associate direc-
tor of the lab at Yale.

According to Bakhru. a wide variety of
people use the accelerator. He estimated
that tltcre are four work study students.
somewhere between six attd tett
undergraduates attd independent study
students. approximately tctt graduate
students. four to six post-doctorate
research associates arid seven faculty
members presently working on tltc ac-
celerator. Bakhru added that 21 "large
number of outside users" from industry,
R.l’.l., Bell Laboratories, General Electric
Research and Development. attd Albany
Medical Center also cortte iii to use the
machine.

whielt has it practical as well as a theoretical
value is the x-tay technique. In this experi-
‘ merit. x-Iay fluorescents knock out an elec-
trort from its orbital around an atom.
Scientist can then deterntitic what element
the ettcrgy cartte front by measuring the
energy exerted by tile x-iays. This method
has been used to detect elements iii the air
and to date old materials in archaeology.

l’cter Matcovielt. one of four work study
students. has already realized how useful
the nuclear accelerator can be to a prospec-
tivc physicist. As a physics major and corti-
ptttcr‘ scieticc minor, Matcovich has been iti-
tenser involved with the accelerator for the
past two years, doittg both independent and
work study iii the lab. He feels workittg on
the acceleration has provided him with the
hands-on experience that he will need in the
future.

After a year of work slttdy. Matcovich

accepted a job at General Electric doing
research on some of the characteristics of
acceleration. He found that his work study
experience applicable to his job. Likewise.
the job at (LE. enabled him to become
skilled enough to operate the SUNYA ac-
cclcralor himself without guidance, which
few work-study students can do.
\ “I think that it is a privilege and a great
advantage to have access to the
' .t accelerator.“ rcrttarked Matcoviclt. “It is a
separate installation rind it is 9‘) percent
physics."

The nuclear accelerator is quite safe ac-
cording to Dr. Bakhru. “The machine runs

 

 

“The heart of the accelerator is called the
‘ion source'." cxplaittcd Bakhru . "where

Health." In the twelve years the accelerator

Ask Accelerator Engineer Arthur Haberl
how the accelerator works, and he will
lattnelt into what he called his “two-bit
tour." With the aid of several pietttres on
the wall of the accelerator lab. l-labcrl
described the acceleration process as simply
as a rtirttt with a background in electronics
can to a layman.

“We started in the nuclear business.”

said Haberl. But. because of the lack of

funding and the need to find research
related to students‘ future jobs. the cm-
phasis has shifted to pttrcly scientific pro-
jects, he explained.

The accelerator is ttscd to study atoms.
Haberl started by saying that the relatively
compact machine "shakes up" the atoms
and brings it into an unnatural state. A
physicist can then study “what glued tltc
atoms together."

Haberl noted that ntatty types of ex-

periments are presently going on involving
the accelerator. He said. the accelerator is
used to test for metal fatigue, the breaking
point of a metal. Materials that will net or-
dirtarily mix, chemically or physically. cart
be aimed at other materials and implanted
in them. creating new alloys. These alloys
cart bettested for less—fatiguing and cor-
rodittg properties. which cart be usefully ap-
plied to tire auto industry.

Haberl also mentioned a type of research

has been running. there has never been an
accident. "The day we ltave an accident,"
states Bakhru. "we will shut down."

in the future. Dr. Bakhru hopes to install
a nuclear microprobe with a beam one-
one thousandth of a millimeter in diameter
so that it will be easier to examine tiny cir-
cuits. The diameter of the beam is currently
one millimeter. Bakhru also feels that the
field of new superconducting alloys will be
a “new world"in the future.
