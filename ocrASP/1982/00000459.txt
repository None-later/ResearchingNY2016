tltc life support system “as remov-
ed. if such a measure is taken.

“You really have to look iit it as
what you would do it it were your
own family." I-Iamrnargren told a
rlews conference Sunday. “I think
that's the final decision.“

Fight promoter llob Arum said
he had been told Kim was function-
ing only on a respirator arid show-
iirg no signs of irrrpr'mernenl.

Mancini's manager. Dave Wolf.
said the charnpiorr's entourage was
scheduled to rerurrr to his
hometown of Youngstown. Ohio

hours .II the hospital Sunday night.
talking with Kim‘s people. Kim has
not been allowed airy visitors.

i-Iarlier Sunday. Mancini had at-
IL'IliICtI mass and prayed for Kim.

“He's still so upset. we‘re not
men discussing tlte future." Wolf
said of Mancini's career plans.
"That's so far beyond “but we are
able to deal with right now.

“I have no idea how he will
horirrce brick." Wolf said of Man-
citti. "This thing is going to affect
him the rest of his life. not just his
boxing career. He's a very sensitive
than and it‘s wounded him ‘very

deeply."

something like this iii the future."
he said.

Arum callcd for softer gloves or
sortie type of headgear that could be

Arum said.

tettdcr. received $20,000 for the

AMIA floor hockey Starts experimental Season

By Barry Geffner
A‘MH' ti'klllz'lt
Members of the university
population who have participated
in the AMIA‘ floor-hockey program
in the past will discover that this

year will be quite different from the :

past years. In fact this season will be
an experimental year to decide the
future outlook for the ﬂoor-hockey
program.

A new floor was installed in the
gymnasium this past year.
Understandably so. plant director
Dennis Stevens doesn't want the
new ﬂoor ruined. In the past. the
players used wooden sticks and a
taped pack. This equipment catised
extensive damage to the gymnasium
floor. This year. instead of wooden
sticks, one piece plastic sticks will
be used. A plastic ball will be used
instead of the taped plick. As
AMIA council member Andy
Weinstock ptit it. “the new equip-
meal will keep the gym floor from
getting ruined." Mark Wittenstcin.
vice president of AMIA and ﬂoor-
hockey president. said, "tlle plastic
ball will make the games more ex-
citing and high-scoring.

Shapiro qualifies for Nationals

The Albany State men's varsity
cross country team competed iii The
New York State Regionuls Saturday
afternoon. There were two objec-
tives: one was to finish ill the top
three in order to qualify as a learn in
the Nationals and the other was to
finish ill the top l'ive as individuals.
Only one of these objectives was
met. The tcarrr goal was not achiev-
ed. The barriers came incighl in the
l‘oiirtceth learn meet. According to

Duk Koo Kim

and it member of the Korean corr«
sulatc discussed the trrcdical
outlook for tile critically injured

llospittrl said it would be at least
Tuesday before neurologist Dr.
Lonnie linimrrai'gt'en would decide
whether to remove the life support
systems kcepirtg alive tllc 23-year-
old Kim.

“They're taking a few more
test." said littl'bara Scar'antino.
“'I‘Itcy walrt to take a look at the
sitilatiorr 'l'ucsday.”

Iltlntmttrgren was trot available
for comment.

The llospittll said the prognosis
for Kim remained tltc satire as it has
been since Saturday night—“very
critical. probably tertitinal."

Kim was critically injured Satur~
day in the 14th round of his ria-
liollnlly televised lightweight cham-
pionship fight against World llox-
ing Association champion Ray
“lioom itoom" Mancini.

Kim was placed on at life support
system following two and a half
hours of strrgcry for massive blood

With the new equipment being
used. a new set of rltics have been
added. When the eqtiipmenl and
rules were explained at the captains'
tnecting. it was met with stiff op-
position. In the end. the captains
realiled that if they didn't accept
the new rules and equipment. it
would mean no floor-hockey this
year. "I can see their point. Many
of the players went out and bought
sticks; now they have to go out and
btiy new ones. Once they realized
(the captains) what was at stake.
they became reasonable" said
AMIA president Mike llruseo.
“Since we have to use certain slicks.

‘we rrrade a deal with a sporting
5 goods store to buy the sticks." he
also added.

The new rrrles are designed to cut
down rrrrd eliminate the use of ii»
legal sticks. including penalties for
their use. Airy player caught with an
illegal stick will be suspended front
that game pltrs a one game suspen-
sion arid the player is required to
appear before the AMIA couttcil. If
a tcairt thinks the opposing team
hits an illegal stick. they are allowed
to ask the official to check the stick.

mediocre ilrect tor us, however. we

were pleased with the way we finish-

ed the last few weeks of the
season." The tllrce teams to qualify
for the Nationals were Fredonia.

R.l.’I'..

The individual goal was achieved.
Iii-rice Shapiro came in fifth. This
qualifies him for the Nationals for
the second year in a row. Shapiro
coilrmeilted on his success. "I‘m cx-
cited about going to the Nationals.

If the stick is illegal. the penalty
described above will be enforced.
llut if the stick is legal. the team will
be assessed a two minute penalty
for delay of game.

“For three reasons. we have
made these rules. The first was to
please the university. the second
was to please the students and last.
but certainly not the least, was to
please AMIA/WIRA safety stan-
dards." commented Bruseo.

’I'hc floor-hockey program will
consist of over ()0 AMIA teams plus
four WIRA teams. The AMIA
teams will be divided into two
leagues. League I will be the more
competitive division. The fotir
WIRA teams will be ill their own
