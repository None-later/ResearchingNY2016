Experts parley views on Lebanon-Israel crisis

By Anthony Silber

STAI-I II'NITER

 

Heated outbursts and accusations
highlighted the instructive historical forum.
“Perspectives: Lebanon and Israel -— Crisis
and Aftermath." sponsored by Chapel
House and held last night in th" Humanities
Lounge.

The presentation. attended by about 75
people. was opened by Chapel House
Director Fr. Bill Ryan explaining that the
goal of the session was to present “good.
solid information on the situation. We are
concerned because what is done in the name
of religion in one part of the world affects
religion in all parts of the world." '

The session feattrred three speakers —
two Lebnese and one Israeli who were
each allowed is minutes to speak. After
their speeches. debates erupted between the
speakers as some in the audience threw up
difficult questions for argument.

Speaking first was Carl Barbir. Professor
of Middle Eastern History at Sierra College
and a native of Lebanon. Barbir primarily
outlined the historical background of
Lebanon before trrrning the floor over to
two political science professors —Dr.

Central Council
votes to impeach
off-campus
representative

By Lil Reich
Slulll ItN/l/It

Central Council voted Wednesday night
to impr .ch off-campus representative Neil
Sicgel occtrusc of excessive ‘
The impeachment means that there is
enough evidence to warrant a hearing on
whether Siech will be removed from Cen-
tral Council. The hearing will be December
i.

Central Council Chair .Icff Fromm srrid
he was nut at liberty to give spccifics. bttt
did say that Sicgcl was impeached on tile
grounds of neglect and malfeasance stutcd
in the Council‘s constitution. l-‘romm said.
“I asked Ncii to resign and he failed to do
so. There wars sufficient grounds for im-
pcuchmcnl."

Sicch cxplztincd that he hard at class on
Wednesday nights. Sit-ch said. “I missed
more than 25 percent of roll cull votes. I
missed ciglrl votes irt one tiny bccurtsc I had
it test." Sicgcl thinks ltc deserves to be on
the Council.

Mark Nelson. who heads the Internal Af-
fttirs Committee, which brought the im-
pcttchmcnt charges against Sicgcl. said.
"The rcrrson the impeachment proceedings
were brought rrgtrinst Neil wits Ilitll Neil htrd
brokcrt the Central Council rules. I believe
instituting tr hearing wars necessary."

Off-campus representative Mitch Flick
snid. “Personally, I think there are many
other Ccntrttl Council members who don't
fulﬁll requirements. There are a lot of
members wno don't do the productivity
they‘re supposed to. My opittion is that Neil
is being used as an example. He is u cort-
ccrncd student who comes up with ideas."

Flick continued to say. “I disagreed with
Neil on that when he came to Central coun-
cil. I presumed he knew the meetings would
be on Wednesday nights. That shows a lack
of responsibility on his purl. But maybe he
just needed a wanting. Now that the
is coming to it close. thitth should be dif-'
fcrcnt."

The vote to impeach Sicgel was 17 iii
favor. 12 opposed and one abstention. It
was done by secret ballot in tin executive
meeting which cxcludcd non-members of
Central Council. The hearing will also be rm
executive mccting.

Off-campus rcprcscntittivc l.cc Eisner ex-
pressed some of the rcscrvtttiotts she felt
about the situation. saying. "I litth mixed
feelings. Ncil didn't let people know he was
having difficulty. 'I‘hrtt meeting (he missed)
was an important one. I don't think llt‘
rcnlircd how important. The frrct that he
lrnd II class was unfortunate.“ ['l

Nabeel Khouri ot' SUNYA and Dr. Steven
Lcibowltz. assistant director of the Israeli
government press office.

Lost at the podium. Lcibowitz contend-
ed. "We (Israel) did in this war what any
nation would have done to preserve its in-
tegrity. The siege of Beirut was tragic —— lt
caused decp damage to the Israeli people
and to the image of Israeli people abroad.
but the PLO made us fight this war. They
hid behind the civilians."

After he finished. an attgry Khouri stood
up and accused Lcibowltz of quoting the
official Israeli line. while he and Barbir. as
academics. were attempting to analyze the
situation. He demanded to know why a
PLO representative was not invited. Atl-
dresssing Lcibowitz directly. Kltouri said.
“When you use the word terrorist. you

' should take perceptions into account and

include Israeli violence."

Khouri. speaking second. traced the re-
ccnt Israeli-Palestinian conflict back to
I948. after Israel acheived indcpcndcrtcc.
when Middle Eastern nations agreed upon it
"national pact." However. he pointed to
various factors arising iii the 1950's and
60's which strained the pact and threatened
peace.

Khouri cited the rise of Nttsscrism and
leftist rrrovcrncnt in Israel. population
growth among Shiite muslims irt Lebanon
and u bttildup of Palestinians arounds ma-
jor cities -— cspcclttlly Iiclrut — who shtick-
cd up in shanty towns. These and other
political and economic conflicts. coupled
with the growth of rm illcgul I’hrrlungist
militia. produced tensions which led to the
Lebanese civil war in 1975.

Khotrri corrtirnrcd to say that this year's
Israeli invasion of Lebanon was designed to
itchcivc tltrcc goals. First. he said. was to
destroy I’trlcsliniun nationalism. second was

to strengthen the Maronite and Phalanglst .

positions in Lebanon. and third to establish
a ﬁrm I'ooothold in southern Lebanon.
Khouri said only the third goal was ac-
complished.

In opening his talk. Lcibowltz pointed
out that after Lebanon's civil war. it ceased
to exist as a nation. and instead became too
different feifdoms. Hc contended that
Israel had no designs over Lebanese soil.

After its expulsion from other Arab
countries. Lcibowltz said that Lebanon was
the only place from which the PLO could
operate against Israel. Israel's i978 attempt

Middle East.." ,

At the conclusion of Leibowitz’s speech.
he was barragcd by questions from the au-
dience. One man. obviously angry. stood
up and asked Lcibowltz whether he had
ever asked himself why. if the Israelis are
not terrorists. innocents were massacred in
Beirut this fall. Lcibowltz responded that
Israel only wanted peace with its northern
neighbor.

Lcibowltz was immediately. accused of
avoiding the question by another agitated
mun across the room. “What is Palestine.
and who are the Palestinians? Just answer

"The siege of Berult was tragic — it caused deep damage to
the Israeli people and to the image of Israeli people abroad,

ttsscrlctl. because as soon as tltc Israelis left.
the PLO would rc-entcr. In this fall‘s con-
tlict. he said Israel was determined rtut It)
make the same mistake.

During his speech. thc Lebanese Khorrri
offcrrcd two futuristic visions for Lebanon
-— one pessimistic. one optimistic. The
pessimistic scenario. stritl Khouri, was the
continuation of the status into, with foreign
forces tcmtrining in Lebanon. fighting
amongst lhcmsclvcs rmd undermining the
chuncsc government. ()ptimiytictrlly.
Khouri hoped for the clearance of all
foreign forces from Lebanon, with

\isihly irritated. rcspondcd with a history of
tire liritish mandate and the I948 partition

Another questioner directed his question
to it“ three men. “Does the PLO rcaliy
warm to push Israel into tltc sea." ltc asked.
At this point some ntctnbcrs of the audience
sttggcsicd Lcibowltz read the PLO charter.

specifically called for tire destruction of

“You got the answer!"

At this point. the that spcnkcr. Iiarbir.
