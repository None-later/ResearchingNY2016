Danes confident

<50ctlon Cover

"I think that early season practices ~det'initely
demonstrated that the team was hungry to do better than
they did at the end of last season. They lelt very badly
about the ﬁnish and they knew that tlii y messed up. They
were ready to play October 15 (the ﬁrst ofﬁcial day of team
work outsl," said Albany State head bas'~etball coach Dick
Sauers. who is beginning his twenty~eightli season as Dane
mentor. Sauers is the winningest active Division ill coach
in the nation with a career record of 448 wins and 205
losses.

' VThe Dane players also feel this confidence. "We're go-
ing in with the idea. we can win." said senior co-captain
lolin Dieckelinan. “\Ve're confident this year."

They certainly have good reason to be. Much of that
young Albany team of a year ago has returned this season.
But as is the case e\ ery- season, there are new questions to
be answered. In particular, the Danes must fill a large void
vacated by the loss oi three postiiieiv lue Iednak and Ron
Simmons to graduation and Dennis Fauan \\ ho has elected
not to.plav. ’

In any sport a team leader needs to possess more than in- ‘
dividual skill. There has to be a love for the game combin- 'I'r’ ’ I
ed with that special ingredient that enables team members if,

to look to him for control and guidance. Because he
possesses these qualities, the Danes rely on Iolin
Dieckelman for leadership.

There has never been any doubt about Dleckelman's on
the court abilities. "He was at my basketball camp at age
13, I was impressed with him then,“ said Albany State
head coach Dick Sauers. He has developed into a
dominating force. leading the Danes in scoring and re-
bounding both years that he has worn the purple and
white.

achievements, lie was a stabilr/ing fort e on a young and
