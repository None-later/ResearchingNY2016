The Albany State ntcn's swimm-
ing team will officially open its
1982-83 campaign tomorrow after-
noon at 1 p.m.. hosting tltc 13th an- '
nual Great Dane Relays.

Tomorrow's 14 team event will
also mark the coaching debut of
f ormcr Albany State swimming sen-
sation. Joe Shore.

Shore swam for the Danes for
four years setting many school
records that still stand. He is also
the only Dane swlmrncr to qualify
for the NCAA Championships.
twice. in 1979 and 1980. Only five
other Danes have ever qualified for
the NCAA Championships in the
school's history.

Shore. who is stepping in as both
men's and women's swimming
coach is looking forward to the
start of the season.

“I‘m really excited about all
this." said the rookie coach. “I feel
l have a lot more insight ittto the
situation here. more titatt most first
year coaches. It's such rt different
feeling between coaching a team
ttnd competing fora tcttnt. Another
thing that makes it easier is that we
still have rt strong club.“

The Dttncs lost three solid swim-
mers to graduation tts well as one to
transfer but the effects of that
won't be too detrimental. according
to Shore. The dcpttrtccs irtclttdc the
