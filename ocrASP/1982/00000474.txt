______.__._..__

Last week the Albany State
women's cross country team com-
pleted its season by taking fourth
overall in the NCAA Regional
Qualiﬁers Championship meet held
at Fredonia.

Cortland took first place of the
19 teams with a score of 30 points.
qualifying for the NCAA National
Championship. In second place was
Binghantton with 93 points, and
Hartwick came in third place with
104 points. Albany scored ill and
took fourth place.

Head coach Ron White said the
barriers ran a consistent race,
despite the slippery course.

“Because the c0ursc was so wet
and, therefore dangerous to tlte
runners, the times were definitely
slower than usual."

Siohban Griffin had the best
time for the young barriers, taking
eleventh overall with her 20.56

   
 

time. Karen Kurthy took twenty-
third with a time of 2|:26. Bette
Dzamba took a spill at the two-and-
a-half mile mark, bttt was able to
regain her pace and finished twenty-
fourth with 21:30-

Karen McCarthy, who usually
leads the harricrs, had trouble with
circulation due to the cold weather.
McCarthy catttc in thirty—fourth
with a time of 2l:50. Donna Bur-
nltant rounded ottt the scoring with
a 2l:51 and forty-second place out
of the I45 runners.

White said this was Griffctt's best
race of the year and it was her effort
that made it possible for Albany
State to take fourth place.

"Overall. I’m very pleased and
proud of this year's team," said
White.

“They really came a long way
and everyone improved tremen-
dously."

White attributes their great

season to the team‘s ability to blend
togctltcr and become a cohesive
team. The wottten harrich agreed
that it was the effort on White's
part that helped the team to beconte
unified.

"He wasn‘t the kind of coach
that just looked on," said McCar-
thy. “He ran with us and he really.
cares about us as people. not just as
runners."

The Danes ended their season
with a 7—1-4 record. In the chant-
pionships. the ltarriers placed
within the top four consistently.

White said the Eastern champ-
tiottship was definitely their best
race of the year. in which the Danes
took second place and proved their
sttcngth. The Capitol District meet
was the best dual meet, where
Albany beat RH and Union.

White is very proud of the young
harrier‘s high scoring season and is
looking forward to next year's
season. [3

 

   
 

 

Rl’l proved to be a pain for the
Danes. Two weeks later the
Engineers visited University Gym
and the Danes just barely defeated
RPl in overtime.

The Engineers are coached by Bill
Kalbaugh who begins his thirtieth
season at that post. He is chieﬂy
assisted by John Quattrochi, a
former player as well as assistant
coach here at Albany State. Quat-
trocchi understands the Albany
system very well and that may help
the Engineers do battle with the
Danes. '

"Joint (Qnattrocchi) knows our
style. He knows what he should try
to do to neutralize ns' attd he does a
pretty good job of it." said Saucrs.

The Danes can expect RN to play
a very slow and patient gatne. The
Engineers prefer to slow down the
tempo of tltc cotttcst. especially it"
they get tltc early lead.

“l'ttt sure that Itl’l will wattt to
play a deliberate game and l'ttt sure
that we will want to make them
hurry," said Saucrs. “We have a
little edge in experience. they have
an edge in size."

Much of that size will be itt tltc
form of a 6'8” cctttcr Tom Truax.
.loinittg Trttax tip front will be for-
wards Petc Donccker. 6'2" small
forward and 6‘5" Brcgman .leffrics.
.lcffries earned Capital District All-
Tournament Teatn honors for his
performances in last season's event.
He adds strength underneath the
hoop for tltc Engineers. He was
joined last year on the all-tourney
team by Albany‘s John Dicckclman
and Dan Cronticr.

The Engineers look to be strong
at the guard positions. Leading the
backcourt is a 6'0" junior named
Eric Weinberger. This guard is a
"very good outside shooter," ac-
cording to Saucrs. He averaged 10.1

points per game last year on RPl's
9-l4 team. The other guard position
belongs to Matt Fecncy. Standing at
6'0", the senior Feeney returns to
the Engineer lineup after starting
for the team two years ago.

The Danes will be trying to force
the Engineers into moving with the
ball. offensively, the Ditties will de-
pend on perimeter shooting to opctt
up the inside game. I

“We ltave a good shooting
team." said Saucrs. "it is going to
be like pulling teeth to beat Rl’l.
We're looking for a tough game
and tlten we will see what happens
after that."

The winner of tltc Albany State-
Rl’l contest will face tltc victor of
the other preliminary gattte between
the itost of the tournatttettt. tltc
Union College Dntcltttten and the
Westcrn Connecticut Colonials.
Uttion is a team tltut lta always
given Albany trouble in the past
and sported a l3-ll record itt
198l-82. Their opponents, the Col-
onials had a poor season last year
after coming in fourth place in last
year's Capital District Tournament
with a 4-2! record. The Colonials
are coached by Joe Koniushesky
who is starting his second year itt
charge.

if the Dattcs beat RPI tonigltl
and then win in the championship
game. tltc two victories will raise
Sattcrs‘ career record to tltc 450
plateau. Saucrs is the wittttittgcst ac-
tive Division III coaclt in nation, so
winning is nothing new.

“The tcatn is the roost impor-
tant. if we win we'll be 2-0," said
the always pensive Saucrs. “it will
be a nice way to start.“
