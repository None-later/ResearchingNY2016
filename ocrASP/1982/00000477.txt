this girl has herpes?! So l'm a little freaked

hear this stupid stamp-clap-stamp beat and
then this whiny gaggle of cheerleaders
squealing “Oh Mickey. your so fine/your

My thoughts of herpes suddenly come
creeping back when I realize who sings this
assinine song. Owning this album is like
having herpes. You don't want it but now
you‘ve got it and you don't know what to
do about it. You certainly aren't going to
tell anyone about it and you know for a fact
'that you'll be damned if you're going to
give it to a close friend. So you look at it
and never. ever touch it if you're smart.
Oh. that's right . . . dinner Well let's

This is “Rock On" originally done by
David Essex. i hated it when it came out
and this version isn‘t doing much to change
my opinion. This music is really bad.
Sounds like they turrted on their syri-

up lyrics of her own. What a charming little
robot!

Sauerbraten sounds great. So i go runn-

So I’m leafin’ through this book tryin’ to think

of what kind of food to make when suddenly I

hear this stupid—clap-stamp beat and then this whiny

gaggle of cheerleaders squealing “Oh Mickey,

your so fine...”

i didn't miss too much. Granted l'm pretty
hesitant to go through with it. but i nobly
flip the record over and begin the drudgery
of attempting to listen to side two. Alas.
another victim of duty.

Side two is even worse than side one
(and just when l'd thought i heard a new
high or rather. low in terrible recent music).
"Nobody" is Toni Basil's anthem—"Don't
want nobody" she cries to me. OK Torti.
you got a deal. l'll leave you alone if you
leave me alone. in fact. l'll leave you alone
regardless of what you do

i glance at the clock which tells me that
I've got about a hall hour to go until my
blind date arrives. So I freak this time ya
see. cuz i haven't had a date. blind or
otherwise. in about three years. So l'm zip—
ptrr' around like someone who's backed in-
to a chain saw. casln' the place to see if it's
hallway presentable and the song “Little
Red Book" comes on. It sounds like this
annoying circus music with all these mutant
clowns with three legs and things circling
around chanting "my little red book" over
and over Then the gorgeous voice of Toni
Basil comes shining through like a nuclear
explosron on a foggy day. i'm really startin'
to get edgy cuz l'm nervous as hell and this
tnusic is really gettin' to me, So l decide to
have a drink to calm my nerves. The place
looks (lite. and not to pat myself on the
back or anything. so do l. l pour myself a
glass. and l'nr just sittin' down when
“Space Girls" comes on. It's all i can do to
keep from screamin'! I wonder if Toni Basil
listens to Devo's garbage songs. cuz this
sure as hell sounds like one. it has a beat a
twrryear-old could decipher and all the
emotion of a piece of driftwood. l pick up a
Harold Robbins trove! and begin reading to
take my mind off this stuff Toni Basil has
spent so much time doing computer pro-
gramming in preparation for.

Ten minutes 'til she shows and now i
can't read a thing cuz i can't sit still. ya
know? "Thief on the Loose" drives me to
the bathroom to relieve myself. Basil never
sounded like Ben-’tiar 'til this album. And
i've never been so nervous. I open the
cabinet to get something to relax myself.
and all the bottles and razors and things
come bourtcin' of the shelves cuz of the

Mr. Ethics

alkirrg of Brezhnev's death last

I week reminded me of Harry
Stein. which reminded me that

the St, Martin's Press has collected a bunch
of colurnrts Stein wrote for Esquire bet-
ween i‘)7‘l and 1981 and published them
as Ethics (and Other Liabilities). Stein was
a contributing editor of Esquire when he
was asked to write the monthly "Ethics"
column. "Make a serious point every
month. bttt stick in some laughs too." he
was [€sz__

Philistinism. Stein instead rose to the task
with style. and his monthly ruminations on
right and wrong (the book is subtitled “Try-
ing to live right in an immoral world")
brought some conscience to a magazine
which all toorfrequently condones various
aspects of conspicuous consumption. male
chauvinism. and unashamed rareerism.
Stein‘s subjects ranged from adultery (he
thinks it's rotten) to gossip (it usually comes
to no good) to ass kissing (his first and
weakest column: Stein admits that it took
the position "that anyone who sucks up to
superiors is an asshole and that anyone
who doesn't is something of a jackass")
Stein claimed no credentials other than a
guiding philosophy which he stated in his
ninth column in June of '80: l'it is simply

 



that lit a society in which moral and ethical '

laissez-faire (otherwise known as 'Hey. if it
works for you . . .‘) has been elevated to a
national credo. it had become terribly easy
to lose track of the obvious."

Brezhnev's death and a lunchtime
discussion afterwards brought to mind my
favorite column of Stein's. March 1980's
“On Not Turning the Other Cheek." Like
many others that day. a friend expressed a
touch of sadness at the Soviet leader's
demise. and seemed much too willing to
forgive the man who unleashed his military
machine on Czechloslovakta in 1968 and
again in Afghanistan in 197‘). whose
political enemies still languish in Soviet
prisons and mental institutions. and whose
sudden shift in policies have made emigrav
tion virtually impossible for thousands of
Soviet Jews. My friends balked at my
heartlessness. but Stein would agree. at
least on ethical grounds. “that we tend to
forgive and forget —— mainly forget -— with

that so ests senilit ."

 

 

  
 

 

Both sections slipped in perfectly as if it had
been preordalned.

Oh my God. the doorbell. i take out the

This was a journal entry of a dream that
Damian VanDenburgh had during his stay

Stein relates how a friend of his refused
to change his opinion of Thurman Munson
even after the Yankee catcher was killed in
a plane crash. "He was a son of a bitch
alive. he was still a sort of a bitch when he
was dead." Stein quotes sportswriter NL"
Offen as saying. The conversation turned
to Hubert Humphrey. and what Stein calls
“the national orgy of wailing and gnashing
of teeth that had accompanied his final
days." Stein remembers the pro-cancer
politician. the same Humphrey who for
four years acted as a cheerleader for the
Vietnam War. who retained an apparent
insensitivity to the horrors of the
Democratic Convention in Chicago. and
equivocated of McCarthyism.

Stein refused to give in to the notion that
forgivrng and forgetting is a virtue. instead.
he says that there are times when it is right
to "remain intransigent" in defense of
ideals. The victims of McCarthy's blacklist.
who after 30 years still cross the street
when they see a former colleague who
named names. are Stein's heroes. while
those who seek a "middle ground." a
“quiet consensus." remain villains. The
must be some unexcusable acts left in the
world if we're to retain a sense of purpose.
“There is a fine line between justifiable
anger and pettiness . . .
remains exemplary." Stein writes. "One
must take a stand. unequivocal and
urrswervtng. against what one perceives as
indecent behavior."

And that‘s what Stein did in his "Ethics"
column. month after month. as he con-
tinued to take black and white stands in a
world too often painted gray. We need of
such unequivocal behavior today. and we
need Harr Stein. l.)

ne of the highlights of this past
0 summer's first annual Greenwich

Village Jazz Festival was Arthur
Blythe's week‘long appearance at the
Village Vanguard. Backed by the quintet
referred to by Blythe as "the guitar band".
the portly alto saxophonist roared through
set after set of original and excitingly
modern music. Blythe is one of the real
gems in the CBS stable of Jazz stars and. as
such. is afforded enough promotional help
to bring his music to the attention of the
jazz-listening public. And it's a good thing
because each of iris five CBS releases since
1979. including the new Elaborations.
have combined Blythe's unique style as
composer and leader. with inspired playing
by a host of prominent sidemen. to pro-
duce music which has to be regarded as
some of today's tnost important modern
Jazz.

.Elaborations features the sante quintet
that appeared at the Vanguard. The group
has the unusual instrumentation of alto
sax. tuba. cello. electric guitar. and drums.
Blythe calls it “the guitar band" to
distinguish it from his other group. "in The
Tradition". in which he is backed up by the
conventional rhythm section of piano.
bass. and drums. That group consists of
Fred Hopkins and Steve McCall. the bassist
and drummer from the group uAir". along
with pianist John Hicks. in addition to an
album called In Tire Tradition. on which
the group plays mostly )au standards. the
quartet can be heard on Illusions and
Blythe Spirit. Released in 1980 and 198]
respectively. these two albums divide the
vinyl between Blythe's two bands. One of
the remarkable aspects of Blythe's music is
how smoothly songs. originally written for
the quartet (such as “Miss Nancy" from illu-
sions). have been rearranged to fit the in!
strumental format of “the guitar band" for
live performance.

The success currently enjoyed by Arthur
Blythe is kind of a new thing for the sax-
ophonist from San Diego. California. who
started playing alto when he was nine.

Dead) were collaborating on a movie
dedicated to the tradition of those very

security guard at a Manhattan porno club.
trying to save enough money to bring his
wife and three kids to the east coast. Mean-
while. Blythe was earning a reputation as a
musician. working with the likes of David
Murray and Chris Tyler. until he was of-
fered a job in drummer Chico Hamilton's
group. with whom Blythe subsequently
recorded and toured. Blythe has since
played in the groups of Gil Evans. Lester
Bowie. and Jack DeJohnette. and. in addi-
tion to the five CBS albums. ltas led his
own bands on records released by lndia
Navigation and Adelphi. two independent
jazz labels.

Eloborutions opens with the album's title
track. in which Blythe immediately
establishes his alto sax prowess. Watching
Blythe play. it is easy to envision Charlie
Parker; the robust Blythe plays his alto with
the vigor and intensity that is
characteristically Bird-like. But listening to
his solos. one is often reminded of John
Coltrane. whom Blythe acknowledges as
his major influence. Blythe's playing
features the Coltrane traits of extending the

litre between mastering scare tactics and
creating terror. Romero succeeds in scaring
the audience on occasion. but it doesn't
leave you with the type of enduring fear of
the dark like Poltergeist or Ghost Story.
More than once the primarily young au-
dience jumped nervously. but when the
lights came on all they (lid was laugh.

The general framework is a series of five

vignettes with an introduction and conclu-
sron. in one of the stories author Steven
King manages to make a complete fool of
himself in ltis acting debut as a stupid hillbil-
ly who is infected with a mossy covering by '
a meteorite that happens to land in his back
yard. He never calls for assistance. and the
story is as implausible and stupid as King‘s
character.
Most of the vignettes have no particular
resolution. they were imaginative ideas but
poorly developed. There are two stories of
revenge by the living dead. a furry meteor.
an attack by cockroaches. and an uniden—
tified monster from the arctic. Most of the
stories depend on unnecessary gore and
special effects to maintain any sort of ex-
citement level.The pacing was quick with
the stories mercifully short but over-all it
was substandard quality with cheap shock
effects.

The saving grace of the movie is the
fourth vignette. called The Crate. Classic
cliche storyline-- college janitor finds an old
box from an 1800's Arctic expedition. the

crate is opened and a demonic wolftsh
lterrd starts gobbling everyone in arm's
reach. or less once the arm is gone. Cross

upper register of the horn. while also ex-
tending the length of the solo to marathon
proportions. Even the shortest songs on his
album become 10-15 minute numbers in
concert, because of the freedom of each
band member to explore his improvisa-
tional ideas for as long as he likes. The se-
cond solo on Eloborations belongs to
guitarist Kelvyn Bell. who plays lead guitar
in a style which is truly unique. Elabora-
tions is Bell's second album with the group
since replacing James Blood Ulmer. who
played on two Arthur Blythe records.
Kelvyn Bell splits his working time between
Blythe's group and the New York City
dance group. Defunkt.

"Metamorphosis" provides tuba player
Bob Stewart with a chance to solo. To real-
ly appreciate Stewart's contribution to the
group. his rhythm work on the whole
album must be checked out; but on his
solo. he shows why he is one of the most
sought after gig men in New York. Stewart
plays around town almost constantly with
many different bands. He recently produc-

of ion playing. "Metamorphosis" is also a
showcase for the drumming of Bobby Bat-
tle. a powerful percussionist who formerly
worked in the group "Warriors" with Don
Pullen. Chico Freeman. and Fred
Hopkins. Battle's playing on all of Elabora-
tions is crisp and driving; his contribution to
the rhythmic flow of the group's music is
immeasurable. especially in light of the
band's lack of a bass player.

Side two of Elaborations opens up with
the only song on the album not written by
Blythe. the old standard "One Mint Julep".
The song is handled at a rapid pace. with
both Blythe and Bell delivering playful
solos. "Shadows" is next. a beautiful com
position scored for the trio of Blythe.
Stewart. and cellist Abdul Wadud. Wadud
is another band member who is thoroughly
in demand for his session work. A true
workaholic. he brings his unique sound to
the most recent albums by pianist Anthony
Davis. saxophonist Julius Hemphlil. and
flautlst James Newton. Wadud displays his
remarkable improvisational skills on the
album‘s final piece. an eleven minute
number entitled "The Lower Nile". during
which the cellist plays an extended solo.

Einborottons may be Arthur Blythe's
most satisfying album as leader of "the
guitar band". in addition to its musical at-
tributes. the album is one of the best soun-
ding jazz releases to date. It was recorded
digitally. becoming the second Blythe
release to employ that form of modern
recording technology (Blythe Spirit was the
first). Always concerned with clear sound.
