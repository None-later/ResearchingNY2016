"Such rapid reevaluation created con-

Alnirirt overnight. it seemed, the State
University. like most other institutions of

cautious funding. "

— SUNY Chancellor Ernest L. Boyer
from the I970-7I Chancellor's Report

 

 

Chancellor Boyer could not have known
how bird things would be in l970-7l — or
how bad they were to get. The "new
realities." as Boyer called them were a
shock after the State University’s rapid eb-
pansion in the prccccding two decades.

When the State University was formed in
1948 to serve New York State's returning
vctcraris. the possibilities

for the nation’s first 
“decentralized” state
university seemed Budget

limitless. With Nelson A.

Rockefeller as governor when the state's
"gentlcmcn's agreement" not to compete
with the state's private colleges ended. the
funds that poured into SUNY construuion
and development it seemed. would never
end.

The inflation and recessions of the '70s.
however. have tightened the state budget.
The State University has seen the end of
those seemingly limitless possibilities and
has been left with fcwcr'zrnd more difficult
decisions.

combination of happenstancc. politics and
occasional planning," citing the location of
campuses on already existing private college
campuses or where a community college
sponsor could be found. and political
reasons for spreading campuses
geographically around the slate.

An arguable result of this "dccentrallra-
lion" has been what some argue is a “le\el—
itig effect." Because there are so many
campuses. the argument goes, lhc politics
of giving m' in: to one campus than another
will prevent any one campus front being
