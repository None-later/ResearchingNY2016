xtended Play records. (E.P s).

have time and time again shown

that they provide an up-and-
coming band with just the right amount of
space to prove themselves. On the one
hand. an EP has much more Impact than
just a single. On the other hand. they don't
require a band to posess eight to ten good
songs. which is often beyond the
capabilities of a new band Countless
groups have released albums that would
have gone much further had they been
condensed down to an EP Coming up
with so many good songs is a tall order to
fill. even for an established act Artists like
The Pretenders and Missing Persons have
had tremendously popular and successful
EPs With Chromt‘ Toun. R F. M makes a

Either I don’t get the joke or this is the

here have been quite a few bands

In the past that have reached

moderate success. but then they
always seem to fade. away into_ total
obscurity. Soon they hit the bottom and
once that point Is reached it gets harder
arid harder to reach the top again with a
decent album. Utopia is falling ttrto that
category ratlter quickly. Their last few
albums have gone nowhere on the charts.
yet the batrd still has a great deal of poten-
tial. Their new album is titled simply Utopia
and it seems that it will surely follow the
path of Delace the Music and Swing to the
light. the last two releases by Utopia

they are led by Todd Riitrtlgteir. one of the
legends iii the World rrf rock music. He has
been a major solo performer for many
years. His top lrtts include “Hello. It’s Me".
"l Saw The Light" and "Can We Still Be
Friends". He is also one of the top pro-
ducers iii the record industry. with such
acts as Meat Loaf and the Psychedelic
Furs. among many others. But as a
member of Utopia. Ruirdgren is it totally
different person, All of his pleasant love
ballads are gone. with it most of his talent.
On Utopia Ruridgren even steps behind
the spotlights. as he sings lead vocals on
only two songs. The other members of
Utopia are Roger Powell. Kasirn Sutton
and Willie Wilcox r none of whom have
arty particular talents out of the ordinary.

The most soulful song on tltLl album. and
my personal favorite. is "Johnny's iii the
Mines." Replete with psychedelic guitar
riffs and intelligent drumming. this song
deserves to be a lift on college radto stir»

The individuals recently made their way
up to Albany for their debut pcrftirrrtatri'e
in this city The band had an addition. the
lovely Tricia Wygal, who handled the
keyboards and a bit of percussion. Quite a
talented lot. those Wygals. The band did
most of the songs on the album. as well as
songs from the “Aquamarine” E.P. on
which Tricia tap dances as an Intro to the
song “Young and Dancing." Hopefully. it
won‘t be long before the Individuals

love to food. T.V. dinners and Burger
Kings. etc. it includes the “best” lyrics of
the whole album with a classic line "(I)
got a love so strong/you couldn't squish it
with a griddle". That‘s pathetic. Most of the
songs on the album are filled with similar
lines and terrible choruses. yet sometimes
the songs are almost Ilkeable. Well. a cou-
ple anyway.

The single from the album is called
"Hammer In My Heart". Naturally then. it
has the simplist lyrics and the critchlest
tune. tailor made for WFLY. You know it's

One good point about Utopia is that they
do put on a very good show. When they
