SUNY officials say that the increases have
not kept pace with inﬂation or increases in
enrollment. Furthermore. they say. pro-

university hospital scrvics than non-hospital
academic units.

According to the SUNY Office of
Business and Findnce. 53 percent of SUNY
funds now support student costs. such as
icachcrs and libraries. In the ‘74-75 school
year. the figure was 57 percent.

in view of this. SUNY administrators feel
planning and budgeting should be meshed.

“We need to develop a means." wrote

Associate Vice Chancellor for Policy
Analysis Thomas M. Freeman in l980. "of
not just cutting costs. but of deﬁning in-
stitutiOnal priorities and of making a
deliberate choice to abolish or reduce some
programs in order to free up the resources
needed to strengthen those that are now
more central to the missions of each cam-
pus."
Wharton‘s answer is the Multiphase Rolo
ing Plan. introduced late in I980. MRP (It
rhymes witlt burp) calls for combining plan-
ning and budgeting l'or each fiscal. year
