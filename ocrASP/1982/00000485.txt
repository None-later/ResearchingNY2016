NCAA is ready tosaddle up some dark horses

By Biff Fischer

With the college season Just star-
ting last weekend it is time to look
into the future and try to predict

* who will do well in the l982-l983
campaign. In this space last season.

season in New Orleans. losing to
North Carolina in the Final Fours
semis. This year. I'm giving you
eight more potential longshots. all
I'm asking for is better results.

IONA - This team was 24-9 last
year. but was rebuffed by the

 

Around
the.
rim

 

 

 

 

i picked what i thought were eight
teams that could rise up and have
better years than the "experts"
thought they would. Those eight
were Oregon. South Florida and
Texas A & M. who did nothing to
justify my faith in them. UNLV.
NC State and San Francisco. who
did a little but not enough. Georgia
and Houston. Hugh Durham's
Bulldogs were my choice to go all
the way, but faltered in mid-season
and wound up in the NIT, losing to
Oklahoma in the semi-finals. The
Houston Cougars finished their

NCAA Selection Committee
Therefore. they have that extra in-
centive. They also have all five
starters returning. so the talent is
also there. Pat Kennedy has proven
in his brief tenure as Gael mentor
that he can certainly coach. do it
would seem that the Gaels have all
the ingredients to go a long way in
March. The icing on the cake could
be the dominating duo of guard
Steve Burtt and forwardCary Spr-
ingeer. two outstanding players.

CLEMSON - Bill Foster's Tigers
lost two heart-breaking games to

Virginia last season. but they lose
only center Horace Wyatt from that
group, and should be vastly im-
proved this year. Clemson has never
won an ACC title. and probably
won't this year. since Virginia still
has Ralph Sampson. but they will
be a force to be reckoned with in
the NCAA's.

CREIGH'I‘ON - With Bradley,
Tulsa and Wichita State all hurting
from losses from last year's teams.
"Willis Reed‘s Bluejnys are bolstered
by the addition of seven-foot center
Benjamin. one of the nation's prize
freshmen. and also Francis Flet-
cher. Hawaii High School Player of
the Year. While Creighton's best
days look to be a couple of years
down 'the road. Benjamin could
lead the Jays to an early MVC title
because of the questionable status
of the league's usual powers.
EVANSVILLE - The Purple Aces
were 23-6 last year. which ﬁnishes
off a very touching comeback
which saw this prgram reach the
NCAA‘s only four years after a
tragic plane crash wiped out the en-
tire team. This year. Dick Wnlters'
team have a very strong group ofin- I
coming freshmen which will

develop under the leadership of
leading rebounder Richie Johnson.
Look for Evansville to return to the
NCAA‘s again this season.
ILLINOIS - Coach Lou Henson has
quietly turned Illinois into one of
the country's" finer basketball
teams. After a season in which the
Big l0 tattered badly in post season
play. we look for Illinois to contend:
for a national title because of a
super recruiting effort which netted
six prize fresittnen. including 6-l0
Effrem Winters. Scouts say Winters
is the super type of big man who
can immediately create a large pro.
blcm for opponent. if that assertion
holds up. illinois will be a force to
reckoned with.

TCU-The Klllcr Frogs of Texas
have long been dormant in the na-
tional sports spotlight. Last year.
though. Coach Jim Killlngsworth
led the Horned Frogs to a 16-13
mark. 9-7 in the SWC. 'l’CU seems
to have a good blend of youth and
experience. as the five senior
starters are joined by 6-9 freshman
Patti Kapturklewicz. Previous to
this season. TCU's only recent
notorcity has been the fact that
Oakland's catcher Jeff Newman at-

 

tended the Fort Worth school l3
years ago. making him baseball’s
only Horned Frog. This year TCU
should put a new chapter into their
history books.

MISSISSIPPI STATE - Bob
Boyd's first year in Starkville was
not one of great success. but if you
look carefully. you saw a gradual
improvement that made Miss State
a competitive group at the close of
last season. This year. Boyd has
more depth throughout itls club.
which should help get the Bulldogs
get through the tough SEC in good
enough shape to make the NCAA.
DEPAUL - With Terry Cummings
and Skip Dillard departed. many
people think that Ray Meyer's Bitte
Demons will fall from the ranks of
the national powers. DePaui has a
much tougher schedule which in-
cludes a tournament with Arirona
State and Texas Tech. Look for
DePaui to lost 5 or 6 during the
season. then ﬁnish with a rush and
get Meyer his first NCAA title.

By Howard Beech
STAFF ii’RIfER

The Albany State men's junior
varsity basketball team christened
its l982-83 season with a six point
victory. 72-66. over the College of
St. Rose ltere at University Gym
Saturday night.

According to Head Coach Barry
Cavanaugh. a former Great Dane
star. the victory wasn't as im-
pressive as he would have liked. bttt
it was itnportant.

“It was our first game. We've
been scrimmaging varsity. and the
guys really got up for it. There was
a tendency on both our parts to be a
little lax on defense though," snid
Cavanaugh. "St. Rose was very
aggressive-it tnade it really difficult
to recapture that intensity."

St. Rose controlled the first half
tempo with ltot outside sltooting
from Steve McGlockiln and Wayne
McDonald. who scored ten points a
piece in the half.

to hurt them as seven of St. Rose's

the first half by exposing soft spots

lead of it points with three other
Danes, Gatto. Adam and Crouticr.
He also grabbed seven rebounds
during the contest.

“if anybody, l was really pleased
with Wilson Thomas." said Sattcrs.

“We knew we had to be intense
knowing we were away from
home,”' said the junior forward.
"There were not too tnanv fans
rooting us on. so we had to cheer
for each other."

For Albany. it was the second
consecutive year that the Danes had
finished ruttnner-up in the Capital

District tournament. Last season.
Albany was ousted in the final game
by host RPl.

“The split weekend gives the
Danes a H record and lift head

cighth year of coaching will try for

Excellent performances were
turned in by Jeff Beler. who replac-
ed Jason Hurly at the point after
Hurly fouled out. and Toddy. who
finished the game with 2| points.

"Jeff has had his problems in the
pre-season but he's come along very
nicely." Cavanaugh said. “He's a
game player. he really came
through when Jason left."

The Danes managed to grab 35
rebounds while shooting 29 for 56
from the field. a fifty two percent
field goal percentage. "if we could
shoot like that every game. i would
be very pleased." Cuvannugh com-
tncnted.

The second half was the downfall
for the Danes. "We slacked off
because we had a lead going in."
said Warner. "After St. Rose
caught up. panic set in." CSR

But with two minutes to go. CSR
