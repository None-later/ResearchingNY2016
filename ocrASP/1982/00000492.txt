The biggest football game iii the
history of St. Lawrence University
will be played in a high school
stadium.
if that doesn‘t give you an idea of
life in the NCAA'S Division lll.
consider the fttct that St. Lawrence
Conch Andy Talley was surprised
when a crowd at Division ll Mer-
chant Marine Academy this year
made so much ttoisc his players ltad
trouble hearing the audibles ot'
quarterback Mark Ferrante.
"Usually there's just the sound
of a dog or two barking in the

distance.“ be said. “You ittevitably
have two or tltree dogs on the t'ield
in the course of a Division lII
game."

One tnore example: By getting
past undefeated Augustana this
Saturday. the Saints would qualify
to play on national television in the
Division Ill finals and take in about
$250.00() in television revenrte.
Told of the television take, Talley's
reaction was. "Holy cow. Are you
sttre it's that much?"

Recrttitittg from Canton suffers
frotn being “a four-hour drive to
anywhere” sophisticated prep foot-
ball is played. But the splendid

isolation of the academically
superior institution also works t'or a
recruiter-offering adventuresome
players a cltance to leave home.
“We recruit vigorously because
of the location. We can recruit out
of New York state because almost
any kid we want is four or five
hours away anyway." the 38-year-
old Bryn Mawr. Pa.. native said.
Another l'act of football life in
the North Country is lack of atten-

L.A. Raiders beat Chargers 28-24

Frank Hawkins slashed one yard
for a touchdown with 5:54 retnaitt-
ing Monday night. capping a Los
Angeles comeback from a 24-0
deficit and giving the Raiders a
28-22% National Fombali League vic-
tory over the San Diego Chargers.
tThe Raiders thus made a suc-
cessful regular—season home debut
at the Los Angeles Coliseum despite
being thoroughly outplayed for
most of the first half. A superior
court jury decided last May that
the team had the right to move frortt
()akland to Los Angeles. which it
did during the summer.
The Raiders. 3-0., and the
Chargers. l-2. were the final two
