With the college season just star-
ting last weekend it is time to look
into the future and try to predict
who will do well in the l982-l983

campaign. In this space last season. ‘

season in New Orleans. losing to
North Carolina in the Final Fours
semis. This year. i'm giving you
eight more potential iongshots. all
i'm asking for is better results.

IONA - This team was 24-9 last
year. but was rebuffed by the

I picked what I thought were eight
teams that could rise up and ltave
better years than the “experts”
thought they would. Those eight
were Oregon. South Florida and
Texas A Jr M. who did nothing to
justify my faith in them. UNLV,
NC State and San Francisco, who
did a little but not enough. Georgia
and Houston. Hugh Durham's
Bulldogs were my choice to go all
the way. but faltcred in mid-season
and wound up in the NIT. losing to
Oklahoma in the semi-finals. The
Houston Cougars finished their

NCAA Selection Committee
Therefore. they have that extra in-
centive. They also have all live
starters returning. so the talent is
also there. Pat Kennedy has proven
in his brief tenure as Gael mentor
that he can certainly coach. do it
would seem that the Gaels have all
the ingredients to go a long way in
March. The icing on the cake could
be the dominating duo of guard
Steve Burtt and forward Gary Spr-
ingecr. two outstanding players.

CLEMSON - iiiil Foster's Tigers
lost two heart-breaking games to

.14 “Sports ALBANY STUDENT PRESS t.- NOVEMBER 23. I982

NCAA is ready to saddle up some dark horses

Virginia last season. but they lose
only center Horace Wyatt from that
group. and .should be vastly im-
proved thls year. Clemson has never
won an ACC title. and probably
won‘t this year. since Virginia still
has Ralph Sampson. but they will

be a force to be reckoned with in ‘

the NCAA‘s.

CREIGHTON - With Bradley.
Tulsa and Wichita State all hurting
from losses from last year‘s teams.
Willis Reed's Blucjays are bolstered
by the addition of seven-foot center
Benjamin. one of the nation's prize
freshmen. and also Francis Flet-
cher. Hawaii High School Player of
the Year. While Creighton's best
days look to be a couple of years
down the road. Benjamin could
lead the Jays to an early MVC title
because of the questionable status
of the league's usttal powers.
EVANSVILLE - The Purple Aces
were 23-6 last year. which finishes
off a very touching comeback
which saw this prgram reach the
NCAA's only four years after a
tragic plane crash wiped out the en-
tire tcam. This year. Dick Walters’
team ltavc a very strong group of in- .
coming freshmen which will

develop under the leadership of
leading rebounder Richie Johnson.
Look for Evansville to return to the
NCAA's again this season.

ILLINOIS - Coach Lou Henson has
quietly turned Illinois into one of
the country's finer basketball

teams. After a season in which the .

Big l0 faitered badly in past season
play. we look for lllinols to contend
for a national title because of a
super recruiting effort which netted
six prize freshmen. including 6-l0
Effrem Winters. Scouts say Winters
Is the super type of big man who
can immediately create a large pro-
blem for opponent. If that assertion
holds up. lllinols will be a force to
reckoned with.

TCU-The Killer Frogs of Texas
have long been dormant in the na-
tional sports spotlight. Last year.
though. Coach Jim Killingswortlt
led the Horned Frogs to a 16-l3
mark. 9-7 in the SWC. TCU seems
to have a good blend of youth and
experience. as the five settior
starters are joined by 6-9 freshman
Paul Kapturkiewicz. Previous to
this season. TCU's only recent
notoreity has been the fact that
Oakland's catcher Jeff Newman at-

 

tended the Fort Worth school 13
years ago. making him baseball's
only Horned Frog. This year TCU
should put a new chapter into their
ltist0ry books.

MISSISSIPPI STATE - Bob
Boyd's first year in Starkvllle was
not one of great success, but if you
look carefully. you saw a gradual
improvement that made Miss State
a competitive group at the close of
last season. This year. Boyd has
more depth tltroughout his club,
which should help get the Bulldogs
get through the tough SEC in good
enough shape to make the NCAA.
DEPAUI. - With Terry Cummings
and Skip Dillard departed. many
pcOple think that Ray Meyer’s Blue
Demons will fall from the ranks of
the national powers. DcPaul has a
much tougher schedule which in-
cludes a tournament with Arizona
State and Texas Tech. Look for
Dcl’aul to lost 5 or 6 during the
season. then finish with a rush and
get Meyer his first NCAA titlc.

The Albany State men's junior
varsity basketball team christened
its l982-83 season with a six point
victory. 72-66. over the College of
St. Rose here at University Gym
Saturday night.

According to Head Coach Barry
Cavanaugh. a former Great Dane
star. the victory wasn't as im-
pressive as he would have liked. but
it was important.

“It was our first game. We‘ve
been scrimmaging varsity. and the
guys really got up for it. There was
a tendency on both our parts to be a
little lax on defense though." snld
Cavanaugh. “St. Rose was very
aggressive-it tnade it really difficult
to recapture that intensity."

St. Rose controlled the first half
tempo with hot outside shooting
from Steve McGIocinn and Wayne
McDonald. who scored ten points a
piece in the half.

 

The Danes opened the game in a
man-to-man defense which proved
to hurt them as seven of St. Rose‘s
first ten shots hit the bottom of the
net.

St. Rose. now 2-2. showed the ex-
perience of their first three games in
the first half by exposing soft spots
in Albany's weak side defense.
Dttnc Freshman James Jones' dunk
brought Albany to within three at
the five minute mark but the Danes
headed for the locker room down
five at half time.

with his assistant Randy Gray. were
able to point out the flaws in the

with-Wilson Thomas." said Snucrs.

“We knew we had to be intense
knowing we were away from
home,” said the junior forward.
“There were not too many fans
rooting us on. so we had to cheer
for each other."

For Albany. it was the second
consecutive year that the Danes had
finished runnncr-up in the (‘apital

District tournament. Last season.
Albany was ousted in the final game
by host RPl.

J.V. Danes top CSR to begin year

in the second half. it's what won the
game for us." Cavanaugh remark-
ed.

Excellent performances were
turned in by Jeff Beler. who replac-
ed Jason Hurly at the point after
Hurly fouled out. and Toddy. who
finished the game with 2i points.

"Jeff has had his problems in the
pre-season but he's come along very
nicely." Cavanaugh said. “He's a
game player. he really came
through when Jason left."

The Danes managed to grab 35
rebounds while shooting 29 for 56
from the field. a fifty two percent
field goal percentage. "if we could
shoot like that every game. i would
be very pleased." Cavanaugh com-
tnented.

Tonight the J.V. Dancs get a shot
at competing against a tough squad
from the junior College of Albany.

feeling confident.

The second half was tltc downfall
for the Danes. "We slacked off
because we had a lead going in."
said Warner. “After St. Rose
caught up. panic set in.“ CSR
started their rally early in the half.
decreasing the Danes lead to 26-25
in the first two minutes of play.

Albany team captain. Robin Gib-
son. led a Dane surge. scoring two
of her ten points. Freshman. Raincy
Lcsanc. then scored a layup to
make the score 30-25.

However. sparked by a steal of a
bungled pass. CSR took a 31-30
lead which they held for the re-
mainder of the game. -

Albany made an enthusiastic cf-

fort to come brick with four minutes
left in the game. Gibson scored.
narrowing the gap to 43-38. The
senior kept the Danes chances alive
with another bucket.

Diane Fernandes connected on
two free throws to bring the score to
45-42.

But with two minutes to go. CSR
scored three baskets to close the
door on the Danes. CSR responded
to each Dane score with a basket of
their own.

Many of the key players on
Albany played a good game.
Sophomore Nancy Wunderlich had
a "well-rounded game" according
to Warner. Site led the Albany of-
fense. scoring 21 points.

Lesane scored 15 points and was
very quick on the court. “Although'
inexperienced. Lesane has the
potential to be a phenomenal
player." Warner added.

Gibson also played well. scoring
ten points.

The Danes face RPI tonight at
5:30 in Troy. Warner expects a
tough game from the Lady
Engineers. Albany will be keying on
Colleen Grecney. who scored 26
points against Albany last year and
who could be trouble again for the
Danes this year. The Danes will
then play four games in the ﬁrst two
weeks of December starting with a
home game against Skidmore on
