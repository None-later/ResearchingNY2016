When the clock strikes twelve on
Friday night. New York will dry
up for its 18-year-old drinkers. leav-
ing most fresluncn and sonic
sophomores at SUNYA to either
fish around for fake l.D.'s. content
thetnselves with a Coke, or just wait
to become legal again next year.

The law. which is designed to
reduce teenage drunk-driving
fatalities, makes New York the
fourteenth state to raise its drinking
age since l975. it has been denounc-
ed by bar owners, who stand to lose
tip to 25 percent of their business.
as unfair and has not exactly caught
favor with the state's 300.000
l8-ycar-olds.

Any changes in university policy
as a result of the new law. according
to Dean of Student Affairs Neil
Brown. will only be those "man-
dated by law." Brown said that
other schools have "tried to use the
law as an excuse for other things."
Stony Brook. for one, has already
closed down most of its campus
bars. ltut Brown said the law “is
not guirtg to dry up the campus."
However this is what legally looms
ahead for lti-year-olds.

HELPS bill

<3 ‘

At the same time. however, (iertz
revealed that SUNY has submitted
a suggested amendment on the bill
to the legislation which would make
ruorc SUNY students eligible for
HELPS aid.

(Ecru. explained that the current
eligibility requirement for llliLl’S
is based on the student's “remain~
lug need." if tuition cost $10,000 at
a private school. contributions “UN:
to be determined to be $2,500. and
a 081. was taken out. “remaining
need" would be $5,000. He pointed
out that since SUNY cost schools
less. students' “remaining need"
would be less and they would not
receive arty aid.

SUNY's amendment calls for aid
eligibility to be determined only on
family contributions. “SUNY feels
strongly that the State University
should participate in the program."
said (icrtr. “The way it’s currently
written. they can't.”

The SUNY Board of Trustees has
not voted on the issrrc. and Gertz
does not expect it to he brought tip
at their next session.

SASU has been recommending
financial aid alternatives in place of
HELPS. The organization believes
a $l00 increase in minimum 'l‘Ai’
awards “would cost only $35
million over five years and would
serve far more students in all see-
turs.“ A chcuts scholarship in—
:rcasc has also been suggested as
.chI as higher financial aid en—
ticemcnts for graduate students to
study in fields of greatest need.

Santora stressed that the HELPS
proposal is only one out of ten
financial hills. He supports a 'l‘Al’
increase. but thinks part-time
students should receive 'l‘Ai’ before
the Regents scholarship is altered.
lint he added. the legislature must
also concern itself with college.
students who are thrust irrlo the
working world with largc tlchts.

(‘utrently the lanrc<duck session
scheduled next wcek remains cx-
trcmcly tcntalive. Sanlor'a is cort-
vinccd that should tltc legislature
not reconvene, lltt‘. bill would die
and would not be brought up again.
Tierney is sure that SASU cart cort-
vince the Assembly not to vote for
the bill. "

More rigorous enforcement of
the law is set for the Patroon Room
and the Rathskellar. which has been
proofing more consistently this
semester. According to Director of
Student Activities Jim Docllcfcld.
the Rat will not be off limits to
underage students who want to use
the snack bar. Currently the plan is
to hand-stamp those who can drink
to avoid any problems. Brown said
he thought it would not be easy for
a minor to get served once inside.
but that it would be up to Rat
employees to enforce the law. “If
you serve an underage person.
that's a Class B misdemeanor." ire
said.

While the law goes into effect at
12:0l u.m. give or take a few
minutes. on December 5. llrown
said that The Rat would serve
l8-year-olds until closing time at
1:30 a.tn. That decision he said. was
reached after consulting SUNY at-
torneys and the State Liquor
Authority. “I don't think there is
anyone who is going to quibble with
it." he said. '

in the dorms the irttcntion is to
take "a very low-key approach to
tire new law," according to Director
of Residential Life. John Martone.

 

That means residential life staff will
not be checking student rooms for
alcohol as feared by some. said
Brown. However sponsors of dorm
parties will be required to check
proofs.

Sponsors of parties may be more
diligent than expected in checking
since they may be among those
liable for accidents caused by
l8-year-olds who get drunk at the
sponsored party. Brown said that
the issue of liability is still “a bit
muddy." However. he added,
"The case law seems to indicate
under 'this particular law,
everybody and his brother is swept
in under the original suit." in-
cluding the organization. its leader
and supervisor. along with the
university.

Open container rules which have
generally not been enforced on
campus. will also be affected by the
new law. Several events on the
podium each year have featured
beer. For those. like ll.A.P. Day in
April when the podium fountains
are trrrncd on again. the university
"may need to apply for a variance
in tire open container permit." sai
Brown. [,.1
