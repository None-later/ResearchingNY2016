Confronting apathy

To the Editor:

Sometime last year there was a big confrontation here in
Albany about a group of people who came here.
Everything was uslir because many people thought this
group should not be here because of the ideaIOgics of the
country they came from. film talking about the South
African Rugby Team that played here.

It is understandable why a controversy cxistcd over this
issue. What bothers me is the issue that occurcd even more
recently hch on the SUNYA campus. On November 6th.
the Watlliiowcr Ordcr dance tlrctttrc collective performed at
Page i'iﬂli. it wasn‘t until two weeks before the perfor-
mance that the sponsors became aware than the group is ex-
tremely anti-Semitic and an avid supporter of thc'P.l..O.
Their efforts are devoted to further the ideals of the
P.L.().. and the destruction of the State of Israel. in addi-
tion. the public was not notified about this abomination.

in my opinion. the public should have been aware of the
affiliation and bttckgrortnd of this group. i am appalled by
the Campus Contrnunilyutlrosc who were aware of this--
who sat quietly and did nothing. At lctrst a protest or
demonstration like the protest trgtrinst the Rugby Tctttn wars
ttpprtlpritllc. Why didn’t this happen? Why didn’t the
sponsors know about it only until two weeks before? Are
people lleL' that upirtlrctic tiiirt rm issue its important as this
can be overlooked titld then pushed under the rug?

‘Ccrtuin prominent campus tirgriitl/ttlions tttttdL‘ known
their opposition to Rabbi Mcir Ktiiranc when he cttntc hch
to speak. Those same groups'tlid not make waves and
sought to pull their shades down and were silent during this
rttcist group's pcr'l'nrittttncc. And if they seek to be excused
because of a lack of information. i crutrrot excuse them. for
to this (lily, the only outcr'ics come from private individuals
and not front “so-culled" prtltttittcttl organizations.

My second complaint may sound harsh, but. when the
truth wrrs rcvcttlcd. why wasn't the performance crrnccllcd'l
We don't want to bc uir institution that provides it platform
for every terrorist organization that comes trlortg. Wiry
should we give them the opportunity to spew out their
hzttct'trl venom to us on a .silvcr pittttcr'.’ tum totally rrslirint-
ed! May we all hr: strong enough so than nothing like this
shall cvur lttrppcn again. May this be life last time tutti
precedent to nothing.

of feminism among the women. lhold no objections to this
at all. Feminism. as a women's belief in herself as it person
and a vtrluahlc contributor to society. is beneficial and
healthy to both the worticn and to society. What 1 object to
is that along with the growing feeling of feminism. there is
also a proportionally growing feeling of hatred towards
then. Now I don't mean just the pig-headed ignorant men
who self-righteoust believe that the woman's place is either
in the kitchen or the bedroom. Those men I also find
myself having it strong dislike to. This hatred is directed at
all men, rcgurtllcss of their individuer and personal beliefs
turd idctrs. llrtving scvcrnl lesbian-feminist friends 1 have
found myself being regarded with animosity. suspicion and
conticscunsion. This is not because of my personal
characteristics. but because I run it heterosexual mrtn. I
have been told that its men go t'nt better than most. but alas
I run it man. In my eyes it hatred of people based on group
stereotypes rind expectations is ctrllcd bigotry. bigotry or
prejudice, us it may be called, is neither bcrtcficitrl nor
ircrrltlry to the individual or to society. i believe that i do
have some insight as to the cause oftliis lltllrL‘d. The feeling
of feminism that is growing is improperly directed by rttrtny
\mmcrr. instead of utilizing it its at form of personal
growth. mrrrty women utilize it its a mctrns of making
themselves fccl superior to men, whom they view its their
upprcssors. This irt trrrri leads to much animosity towards
men “)1” inc vicwcd its it group entity. i do not deity that
the viewing of men as oppressors is entirely \lt'tllig. ()rr the

the job of educated men to work alongside women in
educating others.

Bigotry is a sickness which many individuals are not
aware they héve. Everyone should examine themschcs to
see how well they really know themselves. Only by working
together can the men and women of this campus, society
and world ever hope to put a stop to discrimination. ine-
quality nnd hatred.

Marathon thanks

To the Editor:

in a school that is often categorized as apathetic. it is
gratifying to know that there really are students that care.
Two weeks ago, Telethon '83 presented a 24 hour Dance
Marathon. it was it huge success. Over $5,500 was rnised.
The entire University supported this event.

The follgwing groups were an integral part to the success
of Dance Marathon and we thank them: SA Sound.
WCDB. UAS, Activities Crew. Security. Five Quad.
Telethon Staff. and especially the dancers and the sponscrs.
Without them, there couldn't be a Dance Marathon. Their
energy tttld enthusiasm is what Telethon ls all about.

We would like to give a special thanks to the following
three people: Scott Birgc for his support and guidance and

Ann Mtlfic LaPortn rind Mttrk chrin for raising 0ch

SIM) together.

All the people rttcntioncd above have done their part.
Now it's up to you. Sponsors. please send in your money!
All crtvclopcs can be dropped off at the CC information
desk or in any on-campus mailbox. Thanks again.
