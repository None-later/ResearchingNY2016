Stadium

- <Front Page

prove it’s athletic facilities since the
uptown campus opened. The
original plans cnlléd for a ﬁeld
house. but one was never built.
"Because the Board ofTrustees has
made the recommendation several

titnes to the legislature (about a'

ﬁeld house) and the Division of
Budget disagrees, they feel there are
needs ahead of ours on other carti-
puses — repairs finishing (the
SUNY) medical schools and the
Buffalo campus; we felt we needed
to look elsewhere." said O’Lettry.

The committee set up by the
president drew up a proposal last
year for community and private
contributions to fund an all-
weather lighted stadium. The pro-
posed stadium was to be located on
the sight of the present football
field and feature lights. seating for a
rninutnum of 6,000 people and an
artificial turf surface that would
allow for the playing of football,
soccer. lacrosse, truck and field
events and getterul recreation. The
stadium was to have been the first
part of a two-phase proposal. The
sports complex also called for a
multi-purposc field house.

(Henry said that with the couttty
looking for a baseball diamond for
the newly purchased tninor lcttguc
franchise. the committee‘s proposal
needed to be modified. The new
plan calls for the stadium to be built
on the fields behind lndiutt ()uttd.
More importantly. new questions
and issues were raised by involving
tt professional team.

No professional team has ever
played on a SUNY campus. While
the Buffalo Bills of the National
Football League do train at
Frcdottia, they do not mttke any
revenue at the campus. The financ-
ing of a building by private or coun—
ty sources would also set precedents
for the State University system. ac-
cording to ()‘Lcary.

Should the university and the
county come to an agreement, the

Division of Budget. Audit Control.
.hc State Attorney General and the
State Legislature, according to
O'l..eary. The county negotiators
would need approval from the
county legislature for the issuance
of a bond. he added.

“it's going to take time and we
are not ready to answer all the ques-
tion yet. We need some time.“ said
O'Leary. “But we need to come tip
with a temporary solution to the
baseball problem."

"The best would be a temporary
solution for the baseball team."
said O'Leary in respect to the for-
thcoming announcement (on
the stadium). “They want to wrap
things up as soon as possible. But.l
need time. After the baseball pro-
blem, second. the county has to say
it is willing to go ahead and third we
will have negotiations of the whole
set up with the state. We have to
decide if it is legal and desirable."

A possible temporary solution
would have the A's play their home
gttmes at Blcccker Statium this sutu-
tncr. The summer twilight leagues
that are normally scheduled to play
at Blceckcr would play at the
Albany State campus. “That would
be a possibility." said CUyIlCl
“There would have to be some sort
of agreement with the summer
twilight leagues. There ltavc been
informal talks with them about it."

The key issue outside of t'inttnc~

ing is control and access to the
stadium. One proposal has the
stadium owned and controlled by
the university with the cottttty lens-
ittg the land for its use. “That’s one
of the areas being explored, There

‘ are a lot of legal questions involved

with this matter. it is a very cont-
plicatcd issue and we are dealing
wiht a lot .of hypotheticals right
now." said O‘Leary.

The stadium, which would be
open front approximately March or
April until November or early
December. would be home for
Albany’s intercollegiate sports and
counntmity events, according to
O'Leary. “This is a joint effort
with the university and both the
community and university will
benefit from this project," said
Coyne.

“This is an oppportunity to ob-
tain something We need." said
()‘l.cary of tire proposed stadium.
"We are not using any state money
for this project. This is tnottcy front
the community and the county that
is only available for the building of
a stadium. l want to stress that we

'arc not using state money, if it was,

tltcre would be a question of balan-
cing between the stadium and other
ttrctts of need. But this is not the
ease."

"I feel we are increasing our
chances for a field house." ttddcd

J. V. Danes lose two games
in thrilling overtime battles

By Alan Somkln

The Albany State men’s junior
varsity basketball team lost their se-
cond overtime game in a Week
Wednesday afternoon, losing to the
Cadets of Army 64-60. The loss
dropped the Danes' record to [-2.

Albany got off to a good start,
leading by as many as twelve points
in the first half. However. tur-
novers cost the Danes ntost of that
lead when they went into a stall of-
fettse in the closing stages of the
first half. Turnovers have plagued
the learn so far this year. The Danes
have committed 17 in each of the
last two games.

The second half was better played
as Albany was led by point guard
Jason llurley. llurley netted to
points and was tt stabilizing in-
finance on the team all nigltt. Mike
()llttlli and .lcff (icicr chipped lit
with 18 and lb points respectively.

The game was forced into over-
time. Albany seemed to be in good
shape when two of Army's starters
fouled out early in the extra period.

V But the two substitutes entered play

and put in long jumpers to insure
the victory for Army.

Earlier in the week the Danes lost
to the Junior College of Albany,
70-67, also in overtime. The Danes
fought back from a l2 point deficit
in the first half. They played ag-
gressive tnan-to-man defense in the
second half and were able to tie the
game in regulation. Turnovers hurt
the team in overtime and they were
not able to pull the game out.

Albany State junior varsity head
coach Barry Cavanaugh. ‘who was a
standout player for Albany from
1975-79 stiid. “i am very pleased
with tile way the team has played so
far and they will . ‘bound back
from those two overtime losses."
He also said the learn could easily
be 3-0 at this time. [g]
