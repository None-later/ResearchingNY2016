This past Friday night the new state law
raising the legal drinking age went into ef-
fect, but at W.T.'s and other drinking
establishments. it was business as usual.

The bars swarmed with their usual sire
crowds of SUNYA students. as some carn-
pus freshmen expressed their indifference
to the new law.

“I can still get it (liquor) if I want to."
said Anne Ferguson. who added. “it
doesn't bother me if people are drinking or
not."

When Brian Kaupp'rla was asked if the
law has had an effect on his night life, he
said. "Not much. It‘s not going to rttin
nie."and David Radin commented. "pet)~
ple can btry it for me. I'm going to have to
use phony proof."

Downtown bars were proofing strictly.
and even began enforcing the new state law
earlier tliart the twelve o'clock deadline;
\\'.'l‘.‘s started at 9 p.ttt. and fire Lamp
Post at 7 p.rii. Asked why these cri-
torccmcrits occtued ahead of tirtie. \\'.T.'s
owucr. Michael llyrori said. "lliere ts tio
way we could go throuin that crowd .ll

ask them to lento."

Israel‘s Peace Now spokesman. Hebrew
University Professor Crur Ofcr. is skeptical
of Israeli Prime Minister Ilcgin's stand on
rule of the West ltarrk. Compromise arid
secularism that recognizes the national
riEliis of Arabs arid the PLO is necessary
for peace in the area. he said in a speech
Sunday night at the Jewish Community
(‘cntcr of Albany

t)t'er called for patient. calculated con-
cern for all pcoplc living in the strife torn
Middle liast. He emphasized. however,
that Israel should remain strong and expect
responsible negotiations and proposals
from the Arabs and the PLO for it pcrnitt-
ricul end to unrest in the area.

llut. ()l'er said. “Security is not
something that is foolproof. there is always
uncertainty." He considers this risk of
uncertainty necessary for any further
developments for peace. Israel should
come forward iii an attitude of com-
promise. he said.

moves toward peace negotiations with
Israel in that year. During the Camp David

ding to Ofer.

Ol'cr agreed that the West Bank. by
rights. belongs to Israel. He pointed out.
however. that there is a large population of
Arabs and Palestinians living there. "Iftltc
Jess's want dominance of the area what
should we do with the people there that will
be humane and good for Israel.“ Ire said.

According to ()fcr. Israel has sotric
choices: expel all others from the area by
force. rtrlc over them by reducing tlterri to
second class citi/cus or wait for the Arabs
to compromise with proposals for peace.
I’ 'acc Now believes that none of these aller-
nathes are feasible and that friction in the
area will continue unless Israel comes for-
ward for peace. ()fcr said.

“Our only solution is to leave the West
Batik alone with the assurance of secttrily
front the other nations iii the area.“ said

RZA president Steve llilscnrath who at-
tcuded the speech. "He wants to have

Arabs don't want p ace.“

t

 

llilsciiratli complained that the part of

the West Batik ()fcr wants to give away in-
cludes l-lchrori. a Jewish city and holy place
which is very important to the Jewish faith.
"It is simply too early to tell whether corti-

promise on the part of Israel will work."

Peace Now has urged the government of
Israel to reconsider its rejection of Presi-
dent Reagan’s peace propOsnls aired in
Sept. of I982. said Ofcr. The US. is the
only country who is interested in working
for a peace settlement in the area. he added.

Ofcr condemned Israel's invasion into
Lebanon. calling it a simple show oi
military might on the part of the Israeli
government. “If someone had set Begin
down and explained the past. present and
Itrtttre information regarding such a rrrovc.
he would not have allowed it to happen."
(lfcr hlariicd Defense Minister Sharon for
the ltrashricss of the attack.

()ler considered the massacre in tlic
Iebtuion refugee camps to be a terrible
bletttish on the Jewish trtitiori. But the iri-
tcrnal investigation started by the govern-
ment is the first time the government has
had its own practices looked into and it is a
good sign. “It will take generations for the
Jewish nation to get over the terrible
aspects of this massacre." said ()fcr.

I l’ 'ttcc Now will not lobby on capital hill.
according to Ofcr. “We are not going to be
active outside the Jewish community and
are not going to actively lobby
anywhere.” I .
