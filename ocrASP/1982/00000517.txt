Danes cop Ithaca Tourney

<Back Page

However. after Albany had
jumped out to a nine-point lead in
the half. the momentum seemed to
turn against the Danes. Two
Albany fools, and three consecutive
buckets by Ithaca brought the
Bombers within one point of the
Danes. Two minutes later lthaca‘s
Mickey Herring ltit a lay-up giving
his team a narrow lead. But Dane
John Dieckelrnurt. an All-
Tournament selection, responded
immediately with a basket that put
Albany in frortt to stay.

“We were poised irt a game that
almost got away from us — very
poised.“ said Sauers.

With Hart in foul trouble, tlte
Danes kept working the ball inside.
Jan Zadoorian drove the base line
over the helpless Bomber.

Albany started to pull away for
good when. witlr just under in
minutes to play in the game, (intro
drove to the hoop, ltit the basket
and was fouled by Hart. The senior
sank tlte loul shot as Albany led
47-43. The Danes continued tlteir
assault opening up their first
10-point lead of the game wltert

Gatto shot a technical free throw
called on Bomber Ron Zielinksi.
Ziciinksi protested a charging forrl
by slamming the bail on the floor.

I think tltey expended a lot of
energy in the second half." said
Gallo. “They started forcing had
shots."

The Danes kept running up the
totals. Gatto hit ltis t'inal basket
after point guard Dan L‘routier
made one of his ten tournament
steals. and erke Jamison hit two
final tosses front the fort] line to
secure the 15-point winning margin.

it was (‘rontier' who was totally
dornirtartt irt Albany's opening
rorrrtd win over Middlebury. The
5‘7" sophomore had nine steals and
22 points. His performance earned
him All-Tournarnent honors along
with teammate Dieckelrnan,
Bornbcrs Hart and Jamie I‘rank and
Mltlrllehnry's liain Hackney.

Dieckelrncn led the Danes to a
nine-point lead. 39-10, with nine re-
bortrrds and 12 points, Croutier
followed with ten points and five
steals.

The second half was all Albany.

To begin. the Danes held the Pan-
thers scoreless through the ﬁrst four
minutes of the half. Meanwhile the
Danes kept scoring led mainly by
the sltarp play of Croutier.

“They weren't a good ball-
handling team, and we took advan-
tage of it." said Crouticr. “l was
due for a good shooting game. l
think I needed a good output
today.“

Overall, the Danes‘ output wast
outstanding. The 33-point margin.
of victory was the largest the Danes
have enjoyed in this young season.

“()ur game plart was to be ag-
gressive. We made them trsc their
bench while otrr bench was much
better than theirs. The key was to
wear them out, and it worked."
said Satrers.

Albany's pair of victories raised
the season record to an impressive
5-I. Four of those wins have been
on the road. litrl tomorrow night
the Danes return borne after a long
two-week absence. The Danes take
on conference rival ()neonta in
Unitersity Gym at lt:()t). All action
cant be heard on OIFM. l J
