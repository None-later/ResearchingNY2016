“The team was a little nervous
when they came out tonight. but
they settled down and ran'the of—
fense well," said Alhatty State head
coach Barry Cavanaugh.

The second ltalf opened up with

tough SUNYAC competition

By Marc Schwan
Assam/1 TE SPORTS EDITOR

“This was probably the biggest
day in Albany State (wrestling)
history. in the quality of the guys
we beat and the way we beat them."
Albany State wrestling head coach
Joe Dt-Mco said about the Danes
convittcing victories in Binghamton
Saturday.

Albany easily defeated liinghatn-
ton 40-6, Potsdam 31-8 and Cor-
tland 32-9. to improve their meet
record to 5-0.

“11 was a startling performance. 1
feel these are three of the top teams
in the nation. Binghamton is ranked
number 17 and the other two are in
the top 30 in the country." DcMeo
said. "For us to win so handily is
exciting."

The Danes were led by six

nine. 65-56.

('SR never got any closer as Mike
Otlati took over for Albany. He
made a 10-foot jumper, then itc
grabbed a defensive rebound and
threw it strike downeourt to Jones
for an easy lay-up, and finished up
with a pair of free throws.

"Mike played a great gatnc for

Heavyweight Vic Herman’s
record was tarnished by a draw to
go along with two victories.

DeMeo was especially pleased
with the team's performance
because Potsdam and Cortland

viding the Danes with two thirds of
the seasons losses. The Danes were
17-3 overall last year.
