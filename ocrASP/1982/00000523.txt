Central Council voted last night
to protest the Physical Education
Department and Physical Plant for

I inconveniencing SUNYA students
; by providing irregular and inade-

quate access hours to the gym's
weigltt room.

The weight room has been
sporadically closed for approxv
itnately six weeks, to facilitate the
addition of a set of free weights
received in October. according to
t3tnanuet (‘auchi, president of the
(item Dane Dug Pound. a newly-
tortned weightlifting club. Central
tottncil appropriated $3.000 last
cute-.tet to purchase tlte weights.
tltttt'hi said.

this semester the weight rootn
was tnmcd from the third floor to
the basement. said Pat Rogers.
director of Athletics. because more
room was needed for the new

Central Council

<3

,\nother point brought out at the
meeting was how the law is to he en-
forced. Male students will probably
be required to check off whether ot
not they registered on their t‘inatr»
.Ial aid form. they will also be ev-
I‘u'tcd to show proof of registra—
tion. or they will be denied financial
.nd.

\lany members t'cel tltis is like be-
ing Iountl guilty without a trial.

tilt—campus representative Rob
I olchctti was one of several
members wlto complained of not
getting a chance to speak before the
issue was voted on. He later said.
"not tegisdctint' lot the draft is not
only .t ctitne, n is s\tttl1o|ic of not
supporting your country."

Referring to tottncil‘s dcbatc.
ltdt‘hetti said that despite people's
.ttgtttitt:ttts that the new its. law
denies people their tight to an
education. "financial aid is not a
means in itself for an education."
l‘olehetti was also displeased with
(‘ouncil's resolution because he felt
it made a “blanket statement" for
Council while it had only passed by
one \(ilc.

According to Schaffcr, op—
ponents of the resolution will have
the opportunity to enclose a letter
explaining their position. This will
all be sent to several officials in-
cluding l’residentReagan.

The resolution does not become
ott'icial until SA President Mike
(,‘otso signs it. Corso said after the
meeting that he supports Council’s
resolution "\vholcheartedly"and
that he "can't wait to sign it." Vice
chair (‘athy LaSusa, who did not
speak on this issue at the meeting
later stated, "l voted no because i
don‘t think it's fair for someone to
receive federal financial aid if they
break federal law." She admitted.
that the amendment did
discriminate against economically
disadvantaged males, However,
she said that it shouldn't matter
because everyone should be abiding
by the dt'ttl‘t registration laws.

According to Albany Draft
Counseling Committee member
Louise McNeilly, starting
December 31st there will be a
45-day cornmeal period dttring
which groups like Central Council
can protest. She said financial aid
ott'ieials “on a number of different
levels" have already come out
against the amendment. The final
regulations will he made up by May
2, I983. However. it enough pro-
test is received a hearing process
would begin and this date would be
delayed. El

'iarbells and benches. Rogers ex-
plained the six-week delay was the
result of painting. lighting and
heating which was necessary in the
basement room.

"When SA decided to buy free
weights. we had to find room to put
them. which led to major altera
lions and time." said Rogers. The
revamped weight room will open by
the beginning of the spring
semester, at the latest. Rogers said.

In its protest. Council stated that
they were led to believe that the for-
tnatiott ol' the club acquisition of
the weights would ttot elfect arty ex-
isting weight room facilities.

Central Council member Mutt
Ncco. who introduced the weight
rootn hill to (‘ouncil said that the
resolution is intended “for the peo-
ple in charge to know they are
responsible for SA‘s
dissatisfaction." He also said that
the reason they decided Io“put the
heat on those responsible" was that
“nobody was getting answers or
publicity" from anyone in charge
of the situation.

Neco was disturbed with the
amount of time it took for the en-
"iroccss to be completed. He tnen-

 

The ﬁnest ale brewed and butt cd i Canad . lm

Weightlifting hours out in revamp '

tioned that it was his position that
“all this work should not have
taken six weeks." but rather that
for the moving of the equipment
only a couple of days of man power
was needed."

Rogers. who had not yet received
the resolution. explained that the
reason for the prolonged closure of
the weight room was due to tremen-
dous improvements which had to be
made. She said “when SA decided
to buy free weights“ her depart-
ment “had to tind room to put
them which lead to major altera-
lions and time.“

“A few technicalities came up
dtte to the female students unable to
get to the rootn and for security
reasons." said (‘auehL He also ex-
plained that the Great Dane Dog
Pound wasn't directly responsible
for the “obstacles” that caused the
weight room to retnain closed for
such an cuended period of time.
Cauchi backed Rogers by saying.
"She‘s been working hard" on
straightening this isstte ottl.
