.JSC Hillel shortchanged in SA speakers money

_ *By Bob Gardtnler

ﬂaw. ASSISTANT _

Monies allotted for JSC-Hlllel
speakers have disappeared from
Speakers Forum small groups' fund

 

 

 

nteetirtg Sunday night. according to
lra l-‘rorne, l-lillel treastrrer.
JSC-llillel disputed the policy by
Central Council that put small
groups' speakers‘ funds in a general
“slush fund” at Speakers Forum.

amendment was proposed by
Future and passed Council at tltat
lime to earmark $1,250 for ex-
clusive ilillel use. “The minutes for

At the meeting. Sunday night.
Frome vigorously lobbied to get
money put back into the Hillel
fund or tile Speakers Forum general
fund to compensate for the original

semester. “This is less than the
original $1.250 that was lost
somewhere. It‘s not like we are ask-
ing for more than we are alloted."
said Frome.

Three amendments proposed to
replace the money were rejected by
the Council, but art amendment was
passed to delete $900 from the
Hillel‘s income line to compensate
for the missing H.250.

"if yotr look at it we are really
only asking the Council for a small
unount because any money allotted
to a group for a speaker will be
displaced by the resulting income

for some reason," he said.

The opinion of Council
members. according to Fishkin. is
that the original riders voted on are

ambiguous and do not necessarily

specify that $l.25() was sent to be
set aside for llillel speakers.

"What actually happened is open to
various interpretations." according
to Fishkin. “But it is unclear
whether the earmarks were really

there to begin with." he said.
Hillel feels they were entitled to
the money and are discouraged with
Council for not making the matter
clearer. according to Frome. Cen-

former president of SA or the coun-
cil decided to delete the line. they
should have notified Hillel for their
comment, which was not done.

“I was not at all satisfied with the
Council proceedings Sunday." suid
Frome. "People were changing
their vote to go along with the
crowd and people who voted for
Hilch one minute voted against
them the nest." '

Hamilton. agrees that “ l'hcre has
been minimal progress vv numbers-
wisc. there is nothing to show.“
 As a department chairman with
hiring powers who is also a minority
faculty member, Hamilton is in a
unique position to observe the pro-
ccss. He believes that affirmative
action hiring goals have been
realistic and have resulted in paper-
work pressure. btrt practically,
there have been no changes.

Hamilton said that a scarcity of
jobs and qualified people hinder af-
firmative action efforts. but said
that the school should be more
competitive in the things it does
have control over — the proper at-
titude and more direct pressure.
