“Eighty to ninety percent of information

is controlled by the West." said James

SUNYA olft will be required to notify
students when a student’s records are being
held, under a measure passed by the
University Senate Monday.

The rule is designed to ensure that
students know they have to square away
1 their accounts before they can register,
‘ receive transcripts, or get diplomas. Many
students have experienced “various kinds
‘5 of inconveniences and damages." accor-
: ding to SA Attorney Mark Mishler. because
: they were unaware of any holds. “Then it
' later turns out that the hold should not have
. been pttt on itt the first place." he said.

Misltler said that he had not seen a copy
of the Senate measure and did not know if
‘ it addressed "some of the concerns he
i had."

SA president Mlkc Corso. who also

 

 

serves on the Senate Executive Committee.
said that most offices do notify students.
but “some smaller ones don‘t." although
he did not know exactly which.

Reaction at university offices to the new
rttle was mixed. Registrar Thomas O'Brien.
who handles a relatively small number of
holds each ntotttlt. said. “We think it's a
great idea. Last spring O'Brien attd (‘orso
devised a system where all university holds
would he posted by student numbers. to
allow students to straightctt ottt their ac—
cournts before pro-registration. This fall the
numbers were on view at the library.
C.U.l3.. the Campus Center information
desk and the post office. according to Cor-
so.

At the Office of Student Accounts. the
notification rttle is not being as warme
received. Robert DeVoe. assistant director
for delinquent accounts. said it could mean

"increased mailing costs." Calling the
number of delinquent accounts “tremen-
dous.” DcVoc acknowledged that while the
rule would mean more paperwork for his
office, “i do feel that it has been an in-
convenience in the past." [)cVoc would not
say to what extent Student Accounts tries'to
inform students of a possible hold.
One obstacle that confronts DcVoe
and his counterparts and may hinder the
rttle from being effective. is the lack of ac-
curate student addresses to send notices to.
The library has students fill out cards the
first time tltcy take ottt books each year. in
order to update their listings. but many
other offices may not have as current ad-
dresses, including the Traffic Division, the
Gym. tltc Student Accounts office and the
office of Residential Life. said Como.
"The offices generally have a system that
works in timer fashion.” said ()‘llricn. But

Foreign iournalists find fault with U. S. presi Students will be notified of holds on records

there is the other side of the coin. "We need
students to tell us where they are. When
does a student feel obligated to change his
address? When they don’t get what they
want." he said. Sometimes the lack of a
definite address can lead to extreme
measures -—— O‘Brien said that he had to
contact a student and mailed the same letter
to five addresses. “Four of them came
back. But those are dire straits." he said.

The Senate measure did not deal with
what proper notification is. something
which DeVoe felt could be a problem. But
not letting students kttow of a hold, Mishler
contended. “is a violation ofduc process."

Corso said he did not tltink addresses
should be a major problem if students gave
their current rather than home addresses
and if offices cltcckcd the student directory,
which he said contained the most up-to
dtttc information. t'
