Wattlenberg up for Nobel thanks to student

 

By Dave Michaelson
smrr WRITER

Raoul Wallenberg, the hero of thousands
of Jews itt World War ii. is a candidate for
the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize as a result of tire
efforts of SUNYA graduate student Neil
Tevcbaugh-Kenwryek and the history pro-
fessor Ire urged to make the nomination. H.
Peter Krosby.

Tevcbaugh—Kcnwryck said he was “so in-
censed" after reading The Righteous Gen-
tile by John Bierman, a book on
Wallenbcrg's life. that he immediately went
into action on the ill-fated diplomat's
behalf.

As part of the Swedish legatiort 'in
Budapest. Hungary, itt l944, Wallettbcrg is
credited with saving some 100,000 Jews
from extermination by the Nazi SS. He was
arrested when Soviet troops entered tlte city
in 1945 and was later reported dead by the
Soviets. However. this claim was never
substantiated and evidence continually stir-
faces that Wallcnberg may still be alive iit
the Soviet prison system.

Now, after seeing a New York Statc

rcsolutiort passed to direct inquiries iitto
thllcnbcrg’s fate. a day proclaimed by
Governor Carey in Wallcnberg's honor.
attd a Peace Prize nomination made.
Tevebangh-Kenwryck said. “All of this was
remarkably easy to do. All wc ltavc to do is
remind people of wltat Wallenberg did.“

It may have been somewhat easier for
Tevebauglt-Kcrtwryck. who was aided by
the fact that ltc was at one tinte a program
assistant in the New York State Legislature.
He first contacted Assemblyman Alan
Hcvcsi irt an attempt to get a resolution
passed tltat would urge the Reagan ad‘
ministration to direct inquiries to the Soviet
Union on the fate of Wallenbcrg. llcvcsi. it
seems. had ltad an older relative who was
Chief Rabbi in Budapest at the time of
Wallenbcrg's tour of duty there. Tltc
resolution passed botlt houses in tire Sum-
mer of l98l.

Tevcbaugh-Kcnwryck then contacted a
member of the Carey administration who
he ltad known from his work at the
legislature. iii the hope of ltavirtg a day
dedicated to Raoul Wallcnbcrg itt New
York. This had been attempted several
times before. according to Tevebaugh-
Kcnwryck. by authors who had written
biographies of Wallcnberg. attd who sought
a Raoul Wallcnbcrg Day to coincide with
the publication of their books. Tevcbaugh-
Kettwryck, however. proposed the one-yen
anniversary of Wallenbcrg's being declared
an honorary American citizen by President
Reagan as his day of honor in New York.
Carey honored the request by declaring last
October 5 as Raoul Wullenberg Day to
commemorate the hero. As it . was.

Tevebaugh-Kenwryck said he never actually
spoke with Carey.

The idea to nominate Wallenbcrg for the
Nobel Prize. however. was chebaugh-
Kenwryck's alone. prompted. ite said. by a
quote in Bierman's book by Nazi-hunter
the cf feet

Simon Wiscnlhal to that

 
 
  

"l‘evcbaugh-Kcnwryck discovered

anyone deserved such an honor,
Wallcnbcrg did.
Having learned of the Raoul Wallcnberg
Committee of the United States through
ttcwspapcr reports and a CBS documen-
tary. chcbaugh-Kcnwryck approached
Rachel Haspel. President of the Commit-
tee, with tlte idea. Haspcl. who spoke lterc
last week itt support of Wallcnbcrg. agreed.

For this. chcbauglt-Kenwrycx went to
Krosby. a professor lte had known for two
years, for a “favor.” Krosby. as a pro-
fcssor. was qualified to make nominations
for the Nobel Prize. Serendipitonsly.

to himself.

chebaugh-Kenwryck. Krosby and Haspel
began the crucial task of convincing in-

and calls members of Congress and govern-

The tape explained that “whath

Test anxiety can creep up during finals week

‘all our academic pressures right

“Learning to improve study
habits can ltelp to redttcc one’s test
anxiety." O’Brien concluded.

Oddly enough. students can ac-
tually use their anxiety as a plus.
"More recently there has been
evidence that some people can rise

said O‘Brien. "it's nrore important
