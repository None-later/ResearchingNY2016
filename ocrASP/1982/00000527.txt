semitism as a women's issue and how it was ignored by cer-
tain Organizers of the event.

The sequence of events was: the Wallﬂower Order con-
tacted the Central American Solidarity Alliance (CASA)
and asked them to sponsor a performance. Main co-
sponsorship was spread between CASA. the Albany
Feminist Forum and SUNY Feminist Alliance; additional
sponsors were the Women’s Center and This River of

‘ Women Theatre Co. A CASA representative signed the
contract. About 3 weeks before the performance. it was
discovered by women in this community that the
Wallﬂower Ordcr had dedicated previous performances to
the PLO. Conﬁrmation of this occurcd from Wallflower
Order and Feminist Alliance began to contact Wallﬂower
Order. CASA and the Feminist Forum with their concern
over the issue of the dedication. CASA was unresponsive to
‘3; this issue and not willing to publicly air the controversy.
Because of this closure of information it was difficult for
clear discussion and decision-making to occur in the pro~ '
grcssivc community.
