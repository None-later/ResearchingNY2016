Two-sided bigotry

To the Editor:

Mr. .lucl Simon's lcttcr of l)cccnibcr It speaks cloqucritl)
about bigotry. Hc dccrlcs’ the "hatred of men" as a group
by feminists. And yet hcrc lie is. lumping feminists together
into one group of women who irate nicn, who regard tlrcrri
with “animosity, suspicion and coridcsccrrsiort." Is this not
another form of bigotry'l Mr. Simon sounds likc a vcry

‘tlioughtful and. I dare say. "liberated" man. who has

pct‘lltlps rtrri into a handful of women who do not like riicn.
That is highly unfortunate. llirt it is equally unfortunate
their to brand a group as a whole, to any that as l‘critiriisrn

wrong the rights of thc equality-seeking feminists. and to
ensure that male dominance prevails. Sound like something
otrt ofa comic strip? Well. i admit to exaggerating mildly.

Tltc point i am trying to make is about Joel M. Simon's
letter which shows his male chuuvinism, aitlrough he
believes lic is a feminist and "better titan most" men. There
are many ways to show this through his letter. btrt due to
lack of time and space I will only focus on one aspect.

Mr. Simon becomes very defensive and sclf—ccntcrcdboth
cliauvinist qualities) when feminists vicw men as op-
prcssors. Furthermore. he feels it is a “woman's job to first
cducnlc herself and then to educate ignorant mcn . . ." in
other words. loci wishes to bc mothcrcd by feminists.
rather than seeking to educate himself through reading
feminist literature. through intelligent analysis of this. and
through just watching how hc and all nlcn react to women.
Mr. Simon is a ciiatrvinist wlicrcas he cannot see that it is
more urgent to raise women's consciousness about male op-
prcssion and dominance so that they may liberate
themselves from the opprcsrsion and sexism of men.

Mr. Simon is self-centered in that he feels womcn’s
hatred is directed solely towards him making liirii a martyr.
llc does not even realize the truly grcatcr lintrcd men hold
over women. He docs not even understand that his hatred
slcms from lllL‘ l‘ctrr women have of men (such as rape). and
the frustration tlint livltig in an opprcsslvc patriarchal socie-
ty brings. Rather than trying to understand how tic and
other men oppress worucri. ltc finds it citsicr to coridcrint
worricrr for hating hint and thus l\ not to end nralc
dominance in socicly. ll sccttis that he docs trot wish to stir-

rcndcr the inherent power ovct women society gave him,
and if this is Ilic L‘tlsL‘. ltc indccd is not sucking an equal

don't care then there isn’t much i can say for those who

We have room reservations as well as films scheduled for

Healthy questions

to the Editor:

Among lilc scvcrttl intangible factors affecting the ability
of sludcnis at SUNYA to achieve the elusive college degree,
one factor r'arcly considered btrt highly regarded is the
lrcaltli of sltldcnls. It would be comforting to bclicvc that
the Studcru llL'tlllil Service on campus is at tlic least ade-
quate or at tlic rnosl cl‘fcctivc in maintaining the good
health of \tutlctlls. Unfortunately, i highly doubt that I
could cottsidcr tlic scr'viccs ct'l'rctivc. Actually. huscd upon
\L‘Dlll'lllt‘ occruiutccs l dccni it ricgligcnl.

When one vicws tlic cl'l‘cclivcncss of tlic “ship'cni-out-
patient" policy. you can‘t liclp but feel slightly uncomfor-
table when considcrlng whether or not you arc in good
hands. 1 run not one to doubt the ability or knowledge ol’a
uicdicnl doctor. but their display of adequate mcdicnl cure
is unresponsive. ()n more than otic situation brought to my
ullcutiort. tlic lictilth Scrvicc physicians \icrc dcrclict in

“ricr vcs“ w lien in one case it win the bcgirring symptoms of
