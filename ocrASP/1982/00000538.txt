Albany State junior varsity
basketball head coach Barry
Cavanaugh tells his team that if
they can keep their opponents
under 50 points, they have a great
chance of winning. The Danes took
on the JV squad front Onconta
Wednesday night, and they follow-
ed their coach's instructions in
defeating the Red Dragons. 66-49.

Albany was playing man-to-man
defense in the first half when
CaVanaugh noticed that Onconta
was not hitting their outside shots.
“We went to the yonc defense iii the
second half to stop their penetra-
tiort and force them to shoot from
the outside," said Cavanrnrgh. The
strategy worked as ()nconttt could
only manage 22 points in the second
half.

()nconta jumped out to an early
lead, 8-4, but it did not last long as
Albany applied the full court
pressure defense. the Danes stole
the ball three times and forced art
offensive foul on their way to a i7-9
lead. Bob Hall came off tltc bench
to ignite tltc Dane spirit, scoring

Albany was able to maintain their
lead due to the strong rebounding
of Mike Ottati. Ottati grabbed [0
rebounds before he was forced to
tire bench after picking up his third
foul. “The coach wants the to crash
the boards and try to create oppor-
tunities for the team." remarked
the Albany ecnter.

With Ottati out of the game,
Onconta dominated the boards and
outscored the Dartes l6-4 to regain
the lead 25-2l. They were led by
Rcyford Benjamin and Randy
lrons.Thc pair of forwards combin-
ed for 10 poirtts during that span.

'l‘he Danes fought back in the
final two minutes of the half to tie
the game at 27 as the two learns
headed for lltc lockerroom. Albany
was led by Hall‘s seven points artd
()ttati's six points and ten rc-
bounds. Benjamin showed the way
for ()nconta, connecting for nine
poirtts.

l'he Danes catne storming out iii
the second half and took control of
the game. Guards .lasou llrtrlcy attd
lirian Kouppila led the way with
good shooting and touch defense.
Albany opened up it six-point lead,

but liob Hall thwarted the corn-
eback. Hall hit on a three-point
play and then emphatically rejected
two Red Dragon shots on tltc other
end of tire tloor.

(income was frustrated
throughout the second half by
Albany‘s tenacious defense. There
were two different four-minute time
periods in tire second half when the
Red Dragons were held without a
poirtt.

Albany took their biggest lead of
the game with 2:l6 remaining as
Jeff (icicr sunk one of two foul
shots to rttake the score (ii-42. The
Danes coasted the rest of the way
on route to their l7-point victory.

Albany was led by the solid play
of their guards. “This was the best
