Great Dane Fan of the Week

In a true showing of fan loyalty. l’olsdatn basketball tread coach
,Ierry Welsh made a five hour trip to Albany State just to see his
favorite teatn play. Welsh's great interest in the (heat I)attcs have
made him the Great Dane Fan of the Week.

Welsh. wlto last year coached Iltc Potsdam Iicars lo Iltc Division III
national finals. will appear itr tltc Unhctsity (iynr again tomorrow
night when his team challenges tlrr- Danes at toll) pm. Welsh can pick
up Iris Great Dane cup cooler at that little.

DECEMBER I0, I982 n ALBANY STUDENTPRESS spans 21

By Bill Fischer

By the time we meet again in late
January. the leagues schedules will
be in full swing, and the shape of
the season will have started to form.
Right now. it is too early to tell

 

football. while Kentucky. Alabama
and Tennessee are among the
nation's elite. Look for Don
DcVoe‘s Volunteers to take the
SEC. and also look for improve-
ment out of Mississippi State.

BIG Ii—A growir' power in col-

 

Around
the

 

rim

 

 

 

 

 

Ltnything conclrrsivc. so its a good
time to make some predictions on
Irow the leagues will wind up.

ACC~With tltrcc point goals
and a SO-sccond clock, the (\(‘C
should provide a mrrclr more wide
open style of play. Virginia is the
best team here by a wide margin.
with North Carolina and N.(‘. State
tryingrocatcb them. It is extremely
doubtful that they can do it. ('Iem-
son is slil looking for their first
ACC llllL'.

IIIG [CAST—The addition of l'itt
doesn‘t really help this conference
tttrtch. but they really don't need
any help with the
Georgetown, Villttnora. and St.
John's present. Syracuse should
also be a tournament team, but
UConn and Sctott IIaII are bad
basketball teams. Look for

irrg.

likcs of

Georgetown to win this. despite
\'i||inova's lofty pic-season rartk-

SEC—Probany Iltis year's most
competitive conl'crcncc. Vanderbilt
is on the rise in basketball as well as

lege basketball. brrl Missouri SliOlll('
grab their fourth title in a row. It is
no coincidence that this is also
ccntcr Stcr‘c Stipanovich's fourth
sr-ason as a Tiger. Oklahoma and
Iowa State will challenge Norm
Slcrsart's group. but ill the Iiig II. it
is once again the Year of the Tiger.

Ml‘l'l'llIi—Mctltphis and
Louistillc. Louisville and Meat-
phis. Iakc your pick. We‘ll take
Louisville with l'ulane third.

SUN IIEI.T»SI. Louis and
Western Kentucky are new
members this year. UN! has been
the league‘s best team. but the pick
here is I.cc Rose‘s South Florida
Ilttlls. a disappointmcnt last season,
but potentially a fine tcam.

lil(.' I0---Making a comeback
after last season's disaster. Iowa,
Illinois, Indiana. Michigan. and
Purdue. should all contend. while
Minnesota arid Ohio St. are also
fine clubs. We look for Purdue.
Iona, attd Indiana to finish on top.
urth I’urdrtc winning the league.
Iowa should have won last season.

and it could be that the memory of
that will hinder this year‘s effort.

SWC—Houston looks very
strong once again this year. while
Arkansas quietly is on of America's
finest. teams. The sleeper here.
though. is Texas Christian. As we
said a couple of weeks ago. Iltc
Killer Frogs are a tcarrr on the move
upward. Whether they can leap all
the way to the top is another ques-
tion. We see another three team
photo finish here, with Houston on
top. brtt Arkansas and TCU both
making the NCAA playoffs.

I’AC l0—U(.‘I.A is an excep-
tionally quick team while Oregon
St. has begun to develop a dynasty
in Corvallis. as they have been a
dominant I’AC — to team the last
three seasons. Dr. Tom Daris takes
over at Stanford. bttt it will be a
couple of years before they will rise
to prutttincttce. look for the Car-
dinals to pull an upset or two. brrt
still stay in the middle ol' the pack.
UCIA regains the top spor this
season.

M\’C-—\Vichita State has been
crippled by probation and defec-
tions. llradlcv uas ltrrtt by gradua-
tion. brrt this league has a lot of
strengths. ('t‘cighton lurs recruited
lienoit Benjamin. 'l'ulsa still has a
good club. brtt Illinois St. Iras the
best team. Itob Donewald's club.
unknown to this point and new to
the MVC. still \rill become known
this year as they win tltc MVC.
