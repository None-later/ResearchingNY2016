After tttore than tr year of screenings and
interviews, a committee appointed by Presi‘
dent Vincent O'Lcrrry to search for can-
didates for the newly created position of
vice president of student affairs. is in the
final stage of selection.

The committee. which began its process
last January, has narrowed the field to two
persons; ()‘Leary will make the final deci-
sion. Approximately 345 applications were
received by the committee after a job
description was nationally advertised.

The two candidates are David A.
DeCoster of the University of Nebraska.
Lincoln. atrd James Strider of Michigan
State University. East Lansing.

There is still a possibility that the presi-
dent might not approve citlter candidate. or
that the final candidate might rtot accept
the position. John H. Rosenbach. professor
of Educational Psychology and chair of the
Search committee said that itt that case the
search for vice president would resume.

llecause of “budget realities,“ Rosett-

lbttch stated. the search was suspended ini

May. “The btrdget approval was late and so
we were unsure of the situation."

The search resumed early October. added

220 applications by the middle of December

The selection of a vice president for stu-
dent ttl'l‘airs is one irt "a series of steps to

'make the uniscrsity tttore efficient." accor—

ding to Rosenbaclt. and will offer a plate
direct litre of communication to the ofﬁce

of the president.

The Ofﬁce of Student Affairs is involved
in maintaining the student community out-
side the academic aspect. including the
Career Planning and Placement service. the
Counselling Center. Financial Aid, Student
Health, and the Campus Center. The Office
has been administered by Dean Nell Brown,
Jr.. since the early l970’s, when the posi-
tion of the vice president is left open after
Dr. Clifford Thorne left the university.

According to J. Frcdcricks Volkwcin.
assistant to the president. the creation of
the position stems from the changing needs
of the university as enrollment hits grown
and funding has decreased.

In a university evaluation held over four
years ago. SUNYA was the only university
of its size without a student affairs vice
president. lte said. and the school was
declared to be suffering l'rom “untlerad-
ministration.“

it is “not necessary for the department to
undergo total reorganization." Volkwcin
stated. although there will be "some
latitude of reorgttttiration for the new Vice
President.“
