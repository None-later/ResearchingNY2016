College Repu

 

By Bob Gnrdlnler
EDITORIAL AsslsrA/vr

 

Republican Representative James Leach
of [own has charged 'that the College
Republicans. a campus arm of the
Republican National Committee, has uc-
ccptcd money and other favors from the
Reverend Sun Myung Moon‘s Unification,
Church in an action he called "an alliance
of cxpcndincy" which threatens to erode
the Republican Party.

"We certainly are not being
funded in any way by the
Moonies. "

—— SUN YA College Republican

spokesman David Cohen

 

 

Leach, chairman of the Ripon Society.
made the accusations at a press conference
in Washington Jan. 5 contending that there
are “patterns of ties" between fundraisers
for the New Right, a conservative
Republican group, the College
Republicans, the Unification Church and a
church-run newspaper. the Washing/on
Timex.

Speciﬁc information concerning links
between the College Republicans and the
Uniﬁcation Church originated within the
Ripon Society.’ a moderate Republican
group. The look. according to Bill McKen-
sic. spokesman for the Society, comes from
a former member of the College
Republicans who desires anonymity. The
informant stated that the College
Republicans in Washington asked the
Unificatiotr Church to help fund a
demonstration rally and petition drive to
protest events unfolding in Poland.

McKcnsic is confidcnl in the validity of
his information despite treated denials by a
former leader of the College Republicans.
Grover Norquist. “We have no reason to
believe that lhc source is not reliable."
l'lowcvcr. he added. because there are no
hard facts nor legal proof. both groups
would have to be audited to obtain more
solid evidence.

David Cohen. spokesman for the College
Republican grorrp at SUNYA, said (but he
has heard nothing about either the Ripon
Society or the Unification Church having
any influence in the Republican party here
at SUNYA. “We certainly are not being
funded in any way by the Moonics.” he
said. According to Cohen, lhc College
Republicans here are starting fresh this year
willr a new administration and hope to do
rrrorc fundraisng than the group has done

in the past in an effort to improve the
group.

The Ripon Soeicty is a nationwide
group. said McKcnsie. which was for'mcd in
I962 at Harvard to “provide a voice for
young people and progressives in the
Republican party." There are now about
2,700 members. Thcre have not been any
other recent or important confrontations
between the society and the New Right. he
said. but there has always been a difference
in political stands, especially concerning
US. military policy.

In the January issue of the Ripe/r
Review. the society's news letter, an cxlcn-
5ch network of interaction between Moon
and the Conservative New Right was outlin-
ed stating that top fundraisers for the New
Right and College Republicans conducted a
nationwide subscription campaign to aid
Moon's newly organilcd paper, the
Wuslringlon Times. According to McKen-
sic, these accusations. made by the society
are still valid. and lhcre has been no new
cvidcncc to suggest that they are false.

Gerald Willis. a spokesman for the
Freedom Leadership Foundation and thc
Unification Church said that the charges
from Ripolr are “misleading.” and
spL‘CllllllL‘d that the Society paid Leach to
make the accusations in an atlempl to
discredit the New Right.

"This sort of thing is illegal. There is no

blica’ns linked with Rev. Moon

way that the Uniﬁcation Church would
take the chance. We get hundreds of
thouaands of dollars in tax exemptions
from the US. government, we don't need
the legal trouble.

Leach charged that the New Right and
the Unification Church are forming an
alliance and using each other in a
“hypocritical 'way." The New Right ad-
vocates rock-ribbed patriotism and family
ties where as lhc Unification Church is

 

almost the opposite. advocating the unim-
portance of family tics and the necessity of
a totalitarian world social order.
immediately after the charges were level-
ed the College Republican leaders made it
known that they would be sucing lhc Ripon
Society for defamation. To date. McKcnsic
said. nothing has come of any lawsuit ac-
tion against the Society. l l

Prescription prices differ in local drugstores

Filling a tranquilizcr prescription for
Librium can cost as little as $1.60 or as
rrruclr as $12 according to a NYPIRG survey
of 12 local drugstores.

Lurgc discrepancies among area
drugstores were revealed when NYPIRG

prices of lcrr commonly filled prescription
drugs.

According to the survey. l’cn Vce K

A nran identifying himself only as the

ly lower prices may be. in business slang,

Council oppos

Central Council began lhe semester
Wednesday night with an executive report
by Mike Corso. S.A. President. in which be
reviewed some of the problems he felt have
hindered him in the past and took the op-
poriunity to announce a proposal to put a
part-time student activity on the referen-
dum. a proposal that lhc council later failed
to pass.

Corso commented that his position had
been very difficult wircn he started and that
he had fell a lot of pressure to prove
himself. He added. "I lost sight of some of
my original goals. especially corrrnrurricu-
lion which is really important to me.”

Corso introduced a proposal to pru is part
time student activity fee on a rcfercndunr in
the February iii-elections. Council defcntcd

 

 

 

 

 

 

lraeting customers. He claims. “you'll find
that in just about every retail operation."
Another reason the manager gave for Fay's
lower priced drugs is "Fay's has close to
l00 stores so they have buying power." and
can get mnnufaclurers’ discounts.

the proposal 6-20-l.

Council members complained the pro-
posal did not have a fee slrucrurc outlined
and there was no time left to publicize the
referendum before the election.

Dutch Quad representative Lauren Walters
said during the nrccling “You're expecting
to educate the port tiurc studenls about this
in a week. I think you're pushing your
luck." Alumni Quad representative liric
Saulcr added. “I feel this is very. very rush—
ed. i think it can wait."

The question was also raised by Council
as to whether any input had been received.
from part time students. Corso said he hurl
“informally” discussed the possibility of a
strident activity fee to several part-time

Survey conrmillcc organizer .linr Adams

Council chair Jeff Fromm said he had

however. he had difficulty contacting llrcnr.

He said he had spoken to llrrcc part-lime

pletely different answers. ranging. from be-
ing vcry opposed to the idea to being in-
terested in discussing it.

According lo (‘or-so. right now part-time
students do rroi pay any strident uclivily
fees but they do use some of SA's services
“extensively.” Corso believes that “part

they reap the benefits of this campus." He

so expensive because lhcy know they can
gel away with it." Adams said.

"Comparison shopping for prescription
drugs is rare." Adams explained. “People
rarely do rrrorc than go to the nearest drug
store, so we've done the work for them.”

The survey members did experience some
problems in gathering their data from area
drug stores. according to Adams. ‘When
students tried to conduct their survey in
Delaware Pharmacy they were promptly
askcd to leave the store, he said.

The surrey was conducted by a four
mcrubcr courmillcc. Adams was assisted by

Adams said the survey was conducted
primarily as a follow-up to past work
NYPIRG has done on lhc Generic Drug
Law. in l977 NYPIRG participated in a
lobbying campaign which led to the passage
of the Generic Drug Law. This law requires
the pharmacist to subslilule lhc least experi-
sivc generic drug for the brand name if the
doctor indicates permission on the prcscrip-

irrrnrcdiatcly because it could provide SA
with as much as 520.000 in income. Corso
said hc plans to do more research on the
issue and present a new proposal this spr-
iug.

Council also voted to hold iii-elections on
February l5. iii-elections are to fill seats
vacated before the end of a member’s lcrm.
Nominations l'orspriug replacements will be
held from Fcruary 7—ll. Council voted to
hold lhc elections in one day instead of over
a week as has been done in the past.

SA vice president Anne Marie Lu l’orta
said lhis was not only done for financial
purposes. "Our speculation is that by cut-
ting (voting) lo one day, nrorc people will
vote," she said.
