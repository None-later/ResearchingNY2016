e and my father weren't that
M close at first. He had trouble

dealing with small. children
and l was a bit inttntidated. Besides he
scared me when he took out his false
teeth and growled. Anyway Morn
seemed like a much safer person to be
around. She could always be counted
on to be comforting and secure.

All this would change when l was
about 11 or 12 — Freud would be pro-
ud. I think my father wore a beaming
smile for two days when i told him I
watrted the football jersey we saw one
day while shopping. He took to calling
me 32 — tlte number on the Jersey.

Then there was the smitttierwlien
my mother went to Cleveland to take
care of my sister's first-born. We went
to the drag races. bought an old car to
fix up and played ball in the'back yard.
lt was a great summer. I was 13.

Early in September my father
became ill and they put him in the
hospital. This didn't seem like that big
a deal. Years before he had contracted
a staff infection during a relatively
routine back operation. Practically
every year after that he landed lit the
hospital for a while. Although he
always got very sick he always pulled
through somehow. Just the year
before. they ltad cotne up with a new
treatment for his conditioti which in-
volved pumping tttassive amounts of
chemicals through his system. It had
seemed to work. because this year the
problem was not with ltis back but with
his intestines — a blockage in his large
intestine to be exact.

When 1 came home from school the
day after the operation 1 noticed
something seemed to be wrong with
my mother. She blurted out that my
father had cancer. that it was
spreading and the doctors said there
really wasn't too much that they could
do about it. But she also told me not to
listen to them — and not to tell
anybody about it because he was go-
ing to get better and things were going
to get back to normal.

i took her words to heart. 1 went to
my room. Lying on the bed. l made a
deal with God. He wasn’t going to die.
No matter what the odds were. he was
going to fight off those cells that were
eating away at his life — even If it had
to make medical history.

On my part there were certain
things 1 could do which would aid in
his recovery. When i did my daily
paper route, there were certain spots
where i would avoid stepping on the
cracks in the sidewalk andcertain
houses that I had to do in a certain
amount of time in order to keep my
part of the deal.

During the next month or so my
mother spent a lot of time at the
hospital so I was left home alone. i one
ly went to see him two or three times

but his condition was constantly on my
tnind. More and more of tny time and
energy was directed toward doing little
things that I believed were going to
save my father‘s life.

In October my father came home.
This only reinforced my belief that he
was going to get better. He watched
the World Series and even went down
to his lumber and hardware business. I
remember watching him pull in the
driveway thinking things were back to
normal

But trouble was around the corner.
in late November it was back to the
hospital. The doctors said he had
already lived a month longer than was
expected and they said this was it. A
couple weeks later my mother and l
were watching TV on a Wednesday
night. Around 10:30. we got a call
from the hospital —— this was it.

When we got up there he was
breathing heavily through congested
lungs. His 6-foot frame weighed about
70 pounds. Hts skin bore a distinct
yellow color. He was in severe pain.
Aware of my presence a weak hand
waved hello. i left the room and buried
myself in National Geographic at one

of the lounges. I had prepared myself
for this. 1 had also read a couple ar-
ticles recently which had described
how seemingly dead patients had
come back to life. I guessed that would
have to be it. there was no other alter»
native. My father would come back
from the dead. it would be a miracle. It
would be plastered all over
newspapers and magazines across the
country.

Hours passed. When l returned to
the room. there were lights on all over.
My mother was standing next to the
bed. He was gone.

The next day when I got out of bed I
found the house filled with smoke and
people standing around in suits. talk-
ing quietly. The flowers on the table
made me want to puke. My sister who
was expecting her second child had
flown out with her husband. A funeral
director solemnly explained the ar-
rangements. A lawyer had wasted no
time in stopping up to explain the will.
I just wanted to get out of there.
Against everyone's advice l went out
to do my paper route.

_ The first thing 1 did was open up to
the obituary page. a headline stood

   

out - "Prominent Local Businessman
Dead at 59.” As 1 did the route.
heard an ambulance go screaming by.
That was "He had started breathing
again and they were rushing him to
the hospital. I practically ran through
the rest of my paper route. i couldn't
wait to get home and hear the news.
When 1 got there nothing had chang-
ed.

I stopped believing in miracles

I spent' New Year's Eve 1970 in
Cleveland. watching Guy Lombardo
with my mother.

We returned home the second week
in January and started what we knew
was going to be a new life. My father
had left behind a fairly large business
as well as a half-completed housing
development. My mother had to take
over these interests. cope with the loss
of her husband and deal with a 13
year-old son. She handled this
pressure with frequent fits of anger —
most of which were directed toward
me. .

I couldn't understand her reaction
and i was angry at the loss of my
father. We had been screwed out of a
lot of time together — ripped off. 1 felt

 

     

 

 

 

 

llrr d to get more out of life to make up
lotilte life he missed. l felt he'd have
titrated it that way.

l’urther, the outside world was in
the midst of the Vietnam/60‘s turmoil.
[was Certain I'd be drafted as soon as i
turned 18 and be expected to fight in a
war that l and seemingly the rest of the
country thought was ridiculous. At the
same time we were being taught in
social studies class that the govern-
ment was supposed to be responsive
to the people. 1 was fucked. The coun-
try was fucked. The whole world was
fucked. Rock-n-Roll.

An objective onlooker probably
would have noticed a radical change
in my behavior. Back in school. i
started mouthing off to some of my
teachers. I also took to hanging out
more with the guys in the
neighborhood. 1 was always different
frotn them. My parents were older -—
(it) when l was born — and really
weren't part of any of the social circles
itt the small factory town. Further. I
had grown up pretty much by myself
' my Only sister was 13 years older.
Anyway. I gradually gained accep-
tance although the differences (were

    

   

always there. Drinking was the big
thing. At one time the town bore the
honor of having the highest beer per
capita cot vitmption in the state. We
went drinking a few times. i always
seemed to get caught and my mother
abhored drinking. She couldn't
understand me and i couldn't unders-
tand her reaction. lit the meantiitte the
guy who took over my father‘s
business led it straight into bankruptcy.
The contractors who took over the
housing development were robbing us
blind. Things spiraled. There was
more drinking. pot when we could get
it. vandalism. shoplifting and even
outright theft.

‘ My mother told me she had some
strong armed guy who was going to
beat the shit out of me unless i
straightened out. She even told the
police to keep an eye on me — they
obliged.

Finally. when l was 17 1 found
myself lying in the middle of the road
on a cold rainy night. At my side was a
box of stolen tapes. On_top of me was
a beast with his hands around my
throat. I was drunk. The police were
on the way. It was time to cool out.

That was iii March 1974 From
there I pretty much cruised through to
graduation — when I got roaring
drunk and scratched the piss out of the
watch my sister had given ttte.

Throughout school i had been one
of those groomed to go to a four-year
college. I opted to go along with the
prophecy — the protnise of monthly
social security checks also helped.
Practically at random. i chose
Geneseo.

f arrived at Geneseo with a clean
slate —— another one of the great
American dreams. Growing up in a
small town where everyone seemingly
knew everything about everyone. this
presented quite a chattge. Nobody
gave a shit about whether my father
had died. whether i was on the foot-
ball team or how much trouble I had
been in. The Vietnam war had ended
—— talk of revolution had turrted to

muslt.

The pressure was tiff. But quiet
times did not bring peace. There was a
certain ecrtness in the placity. it was a
time to reflect on the hell of the last
five years. For the first time i saw the

full effect that hell had me. I was a
tnuch different person than the one
who had spetit the summer of '(i‘) with
his father

This time period was also marked by

a massive use of drugs -v as ittuch of
atiytlting as I could get my hands on

Through all this. i feel like We learn-

american family —- not by having it but
by having it and losing it. A family is a
great source of values. whatever those
values may be, No matter what those
values are. no matter what they might
be —— there still are a set of values.
Whether you decide to go along with
them or rebel they still are affecting
you. Without a family per se, there is
nothing there to identify with or rebel
against.
