figures. whether they be biological
parents or surrogates oi the state. are
in conflict with their offspring. The
sooner we come to grips with this pro-
blem the sooner we can begin to
recognire that the home is not a place
of peace. but rather it (the lioirie) is the
first of many battlefields that we all
must face.

If we continue to hide behind the
myths that we now choose to force
feed ourselves. we will soon find that
the family and not nuclear weapons
will head the list as the most likely
destroyer of humankind. The message
is a painful one, but nowhere near as
painful as the present level of aliena-
tioir and exploitation. When pushed
into new eras the old among us always
tell the young among us to remember
the past with all its traditions. Tradi-
tions such as classism. racialism. sex-
ism are the real reasons for the so-
called success of this supposed great
nation of ours.

it is easy to be a number when you
lie. kill. rob and cheat your way to the
top. When that sort of thing happens
in other nations. we are quick to say
lots of very‘ nasty things about the
character of the leadership that gained
power in such a way. However. in our
own society we are supposed to
overlook such failings of our culture.
our society to live by the rules we have
set for ourselves. Saying that this na-
tion 151118 best of the lot cart no longer
be used as an excuse to hide the death
and destruction that our government
and our parents have brought to be.

The entire world was at war and all
we cared about was ourselves. Our
parents. having lived through the
Great Depression. constantly use it as
the basis for their behavior today as it
we (the young) must listen. Reagan

Healthy response

To the Editor:.

in response to “Healthy Questions" ASP
December 10, 1982.

The Student Health Service always welcomes well
documented criticism and constructive suggestions.

Criticism based on hcrcsny is useless, unfortunate-
iy. If the critic has had only one visit to the Health
Service and that on the same day the piece appears in
the ASP, it scents reasonable to assume (1) that he
has better means llitln most of us of by-pussing the
ASP deadline or (2) that the article was written
before his visit to the service and thus based on
lrercsuy.

Actually we have ti very low referral-out rate. far
twin a "ship ‘crrr out" policy. On the other hand we
are prudent and take full advantage of the excellent
medical resources in this area when we feel it is in the
ptrticrrt's best interest.

1 urge any critic to come iii and discuss inattch of
concern at tiny time.

A quality fan

To the Editor:

I would like to point out the great injustice your
publication is proiiiulgaling — even it' it is in no way
intentional. Each neck you identify a person whom
you consider to be the “Great Dane Fain of the
Week," usually the individual who has drawn the
most attention to himself through the use of a
costume banner. etc. 11' uril'lagging support, loyalty
and love count for anything. 1 must submit the name
at Leslie “Bennie” Sicgel its the outstanding Great
Dane Fan. For the past fifteen years the Albany State

: equipment rntinugcr has led cheers and chants with
his trust bullhorn and bell at hundreds and hun-
dreds ol' (ireut Danie sporting events. at home and on
the road. The University community owes this man
an enormous debt of thanks. and 1 would appreciate
your furnishing a proper salutc.

——Kenneth S. Ross

When the Great Dane Fun of the Week was in-
lI'orlirced irt Iflt'.V/)1)I'I.S'.\‘L’L'Ii0ll on ON. I, I 982, Bennie

To WCDB with sarcasm

['0 the lirlilor: .

As a new student in Albany, 1 would like to com-
pliment Sthi’ (or its radio station. Erery time 1 tune
in, l llk‘ill’ one ol' my favorite songs. over and over
again. 1 really like this new power stuff". 1 especially
like the “try l).1\ Itilk during and between every
song. 13y llit.‘ nay. 1 hope that jii/l slul't'gcts taken off
the air. I don't listen to it, and 1 know most 01' my
l‘r'ieirdx don't either. Thank God that Third World
l’r'ogrrrrrr is on early Sunday morning while we are all
sleeping.

1 also hope 91 gets rid of ' rose weirdo DJ's who
play iliiligs you never hear :r- .rirr like they do at Rl’l.
l'lrrrt's the dil‘l‘erence between it tech school and a
comrrrercitil business collc :. Keep going guys, and
maybe you can get IlCODlt 10 brry commercials on the
station.

All I can say is, 1 rival to listen to WF‘LY. but now
| listen to WCDB!
