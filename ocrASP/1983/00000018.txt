After a year-long nationwide search for
the Rockefeller Institute of Public Affairs
and Policy's first director. President Vin-
cent O'I.eary said he and SUNY Chancellor
Wharton have temporarin abandoned their
search and appointed Search Committee
member Warren Ilchman to the post.

Ilchman, who is the SUNYA vice-
prcsident for research and educational
developtneut. never actually applied for the
pesitlon at the institute located downtown
at 4] I State St.; the search committee could
not find a candidate to tncct their qualifica-
tions. he said.

The scarclt committee was looking for a
scholarly person “who liked governtnertt
relationships. fund raising attd administra-
tion," said Ilchman. He added that the
search for a director began last January and
has included applicants front government
and ttniversitics across the nation.

Ilchman is now on a leave of absence lili-
til June l9tl4 when a new director will most
likely be selected to take his place. In the
meantime. Ilclunau continues to receive his
current salary. Filling in for Ilchman dur-
ing his leave of absence will be Dean of the
College of Humanities amt Fine Arts. John
Shumaker.

Since last June. Ilchtnan has been serving
as the institute‘s acting director. although

he was still reviewing applications.

In January the committee was still unable
to find a suitable applicant. and Ilchman
was asked to assume the position until
June. I984. He explained that Wharton
and O'Leary "felt this was too important a
time to re-opcn for applications."

According to university spokesperson
Dr. Marie Ritddcn, the four principal ac-
tivities of the institute are: (I)advanced
graduate studies in government through in-

"We ’rc very, very fortunate
that (Ilchman) took this
position. He '5 an expert in his
fie! .”

(3)the research and study of specific pro-
blems facing state govcrmucnt; and (4)the
completion and review of public policy

tions and conduct research.

chmau has been doing a “superlative job."
He commented that “we're very, very for-
tunate that (Ilchmanhook this position.

added, “I don‘t like not having him in the
vice president's role."

ty. and a professor and dean of the College
