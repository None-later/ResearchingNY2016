A redecorated Dutch Qttad
cafeteria greeted students artd
cmplyces upon their return for the
first meal of the spring semester.
btrt students had varied opinions
about the changes.

Norbert Zahm. University Ans--
iliury Service (icneral Manager.
maintained that. "l-aclr year. in all
the operations that we (UAS) have.
we set aside a certain amount of
funds for equipment. At the ap-
pr'opriatc time. as we see rtecessary.
we replace tlte equipment. Dutch
Quad is tlte oldest quad and the
equipment attd fttruiturc were
worn."

’I'lre remodeling Cost approx-
imater $|tltl.t)()t). according to
labor. He said that UAS platts to
retnodel the other quad catcterias,
bttt the time frame for the plans is
uncertain.

In additiott. HAS Controller
.larncs Trudeau said that Dutch
Quad Cafeteria \\ as tcrrrodcled dur~
irrg winter recess because snmrner
school lrotrsing will be held on
Dutch Quad this summer.

UAS Student Supervisor Mark
Taylor said. "our ttew cafeteria is
nicer than the other quads. The new
blue arid white colors are more live-
ly than the old brown and yellow."

Most Dutch Qttad rcsidcnts find
the decor more pleasartt. attd “niec-
looking" bttt do ttot agree that it is
all that sensible. Karen Stolars'ki
cotnrrrertlcd. “It looks very nice.
brtt it's not very practical. There‘s a
waste of space iii the dining room
area, and it becomes very crowded
by the soda machines." .lcff Iidcn
suggested that “the cafeteria
workers be paitttcd blue in order to
rnatclt the rtcw wall paint."

Nora liinhoin and Lois Werner

' believe the “rig-rag pattern of the

tables could be a safety ha/ard."
Graduate sttrdcnt Mike (iart'inkcl
poitrtcd otrt that the trays do not fit
on the square tables settling four
people. not do they fit on tltc round
tables.

Jeff limdin commented. “UAS
should have irtvcsted the funds in
better food instcttd." Others
reiterated this feeling that the quali-
ty of the food is more irrrportatrt
than the atmosphere.

'l'om Holownia demanded.
“Why couldn‘t they purchase an
extra toaster instead of art extra
juice machine? The litre to use the
toaster at Sunday brunehcs is very
long.“

Another corrrrrtorr complaint was
that it was uncomfortable to share a
table with strangers. il'one is unable
to find artd crrrpty table available.
Monica (it‘ttssltttttttt said. “It's dif-
l'iL’ttlt to see and locate your friends
itt this new setup."

Altltortglt according to Taylor. lit)
seats were lost ill the change. Zahm
claims that only ()0 seats were
removed. “We are considering ad-
ding seats and are carefully looking
into the situation.“

Matty Dutch Quad residents ex-
pressed their anger artd frustration
about lltc lack of seats. Several
students wonder what will happen
during special holiday dinners when
tltc dining room becomes congested
as irt the past. (‘hel' Manager Floyd
lvtarr admits there is a problem. bttt
believes stttderrt cooperation is the
solution.

“The studcttts now seem to be us-
ed to the new set-up. and they are
cooperating with one another.
When they‘re finished eating." said
Man. "the students get up to give
their seats to the next group. Also.
the new chsnge improves the at—
mosphcrc.”

New additions to the cafeteria irr-
cludc blue carpeting. white tables.
blue chairs. window blinds. a clock.
a salad bar. a “seconds island." a
coffee machine, two HiC drink
machines. two juice machines. two
milk machines. two beverage
centers. artd art ice cream bar.

Dining Room Supervisor Ellie
Willinglrarrr added that a new hot
chocolate rrrachinc and large ice
cream flavor signs are expected to
be delivered this week. Willingltarrt
stressed that the “beautiful new set-
up of the tables provides a better.
rrrore private atmosphere for
students." There are now ttlblcs
available which scat two. four. si\.
or eight students at a time. "Now
students can hear each other
speak!" said Willirrgltatn.

explain everything I know about life and love. My girlfriend
suggested a short story.

Anyway, the French Department at my school is going
to throw a party for me. They're celebrating because the
book is written in English.

Mme. Berryman, the Department Chairman. said she'll
serve my favorite ice-cold Celia Wines at the party. To
thank her, I'd like to propose a toast in French. Can you
