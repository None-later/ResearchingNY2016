Student alcohol abuse decreases

(CPS)Thc number of students who drink alcohol —
now estimates at 82 percent of the approximately 12
million college students in the nation — may have
leveled off for the first time in two decades. two
university researchers report.

Moreover. alcohol abttsc and the side-effects of

_ heavy drinking have also steadied for the first time In

years, according to the preliminary results of a study
of over 5.000 college students irt all 50 states last
semester. ,

The nutnber of students who drink has been rising
steadily since the early 1950s. numerous studies and
surveys over the years have found.

But now. the first natiomvide survey of college
drinkers indicates the 20-year rise in the number of stu-
dent drinkers may ltave reached its apex. ’

“There have been a number of regional surveys
dotte over the years, bttt because they were all done by
different researchers itt different parts of the country.
they lacked continuity." explained Dttvid Hanson.
associate professor of sociology at the State University

Solomon Amendment called unconstitutional

Thcn they reduced it to an affirnnttion. So. my feeling
is if they're going to do anything. that's as far as I
would go. Make the student sigtt it. at least. tlten if
they get into problems. he ltas signed the stttlcntctll.
lint it’s; impossible. It is virtttally impossible for us to
do this."

“These sclcctivc prosecutions should be unconstitu-
tional." he added. "It only effects people who are
dcpcttdcttt on financial aid. People with enough
money aren't bothered by this at all. It‘s an injustice."

Central Cottttcil passed a resolution Wednesday
night by lb-li suggesting that Congr ss repeal lltc
legislation mandating the resolutions. A similar
resolution passed last semester by a vote of l3-I I.

Eric Schaffcr. Alumni Quad Central Council
representative and chair of its Studcttt Action Commit-
tee is organiring a letter-writing and petition-gathering
campaign with the Peace Project and other student
groups opposing the regulations. "What I want to do
is try to work with SASU arid USSA (United States
Student Association). We want to take all the stu ff We
collect here on the catnpus wltcn we go down to
Washington I).C....and distribute these personally to
the congressmen that tire written to from tip here.“ he
said. "What we're trying to do is to get them to rCCOIl-
sider. repeal the law."

Schaffcr said that he had received a letter frotn
SUNY Chancellor Clifton Wharton stating that the
central administration opposed the regulations. and
that a tnorc lctrgtlty position statement would be
released next \vcck. Irow that the rcgttlations have been
tclcasctl attd cart he examined. Schul aid that he
hoped his cornmitcc‘s actions would culminate in a
campus-wide referendum iii the spring election ttttd
stressed. "My tnain objective is to let people kttotv
what (the law) is."

MPIRCr‘s challcttgc of the law received a setback
last week. Miller said. when the fcdclnl judge hearing
the case ruled that tile advocacy organization had no
standing iii the casc.c|aitning that the regulations were
not germane to the stttdcnt»run organization. Miller
said that MPIRCI t'c-i‘ilcd its stilt immediately after that
rttling on behalf of three ".Iohn Docs" who say they
will be denied financial aid by tltc law.

MPlRG's Sctiior Attorney. E. Gail Suchman. sttid
that the organization filed suit on the grounds that the
law is unconstitutional because:

u it constitutes a Bill of Attaindcr .

> it interferes with a student's right against self-
incrimination

> it deities a student equal protection under the law.

Sttchman also said that the law violates the Privacy

of New York College at Potsdam. Who co-authorcd
the study along with Indiana University health and
safety Professor R'uth Engs.

Based on research Engs had done in the mid-
seventies. the two researchers said their new study
points to it significant leveling-off in drinking and
alcohol abuse by students.

Engs and Hanson noted only a marginal ittcrcasc in
the level of stttdent drinking, far below the rate of
earlier years. -

And while the number of drinkers appears to have
peaked at 82 percent, Hanson_and Engs added that
heavy drinking and problems associated with alcohol
abuse — fighting. lateness to class. and damaging trn-
viersity property -— are also leveling off.

The proportion of heavy drinkers has increased
from l2 percent in the mid-seventies to 17 percent. not
nearly the increase some officials had feared. Hanson
said. .

He thinks pttrt of the reason for the leveling-off
tnigltl be because students are substituting otltcr drugs,
such as marijuana. itt place of drinking. . i

Act. She explained that the preliminary injunction
MPIRCI seeks would “immediately restrain the
Depat ttncnt of [Education and Selective Service System
from implementing or enforcing the lttw iii any manner
pending the outcome of this litigation." She added
that MI’IRti is not challenging draft rcgisttalioii itself.
but only enforcement in this contest.

Miller downplayed the importance of the judge‘s
upcoming rrtlittg. “it will end tip in the Htlt Circuit Ap-
peals (‘ont't anyway-it‘s just :1 rmtllcr of who wins the
first round." Itc said.

Sterling Henry of the National Organilation of
lilttck University and College Students said that “due
to the social and econotnic situation of black Amcrictt.
a disproportionttte number of black students need
financial aid. This law will place ttn ttnfair btrrdett on
young black men attd tnakc it cvctt tnorc difficult for
tltcrn to rcccivc financial assistance."

.lanice Fine. USSA Presidcttt and SUNYA stttdcttt
said that tile measure “is all administrative nightmare,
a constitutional travest and a threat to the equality of
access ttpott which all of our efforts to preserve higher
edttcatioin rests." She added that USSA is organi/ing
lobbying of congressional reprcscntalivcs iti order to
repeal the law. I
