Uncle Solomon Wants you"

most regressive legislation into law tltat has ever

past through Washington. A recent example of

this kind of legislation should be of particrrlar interest to
students ~— it's called the Solomon Amendment.

This bizarre piece of legislation was passed by Congress

T he Reagan administration has signed some of tire

over tlte summer and was signed by President Reagan in .

early September. it requires tltat all ntale students — and
perhaps even female students—either provide proof
that they have registered for tire draft or sign a statement
stating that they are not required to do so. if they are
unable to comply with the requirement. or if tltey haven't
registered for the draft. the university‘s financial aid office
can't give that student any fittancial aid. I

In doing so. the regulations violate at least one federal
law and three constitutional principles. Not had fora sim-
ple rider on an appropriations bill.

One of the biggest problems with the regulations is the
violation of due process written into the law. Ordinarily
when a person is accrrsed of a crime. they must be indicted.
tried. and eonricted before they receive punishment. The
Solomon regulations bypass that constitutional prirtciplc by
denying federal edrtcational aid to any man unable to prove
that he registered for the draft. The punishment is being in-
flicted without benefit of trial.

The regulations also place the burden of proof on the
student. Every male student will be required to prove that

C

 

he didn‘t violate the registration law — not just once. brrt

every year he applies for federally-sponsored financial aid.

The regulations eliminate the time-honored pratiee of “in-
nocent until proven guilty." Under the Solomon Amend-
ment, every male college student is guilty until he proves
himself ittnocent.

More insidious is the way the law discriminates against
low and middle income students. Students wealthy enough
to ttot need federal financial aid to pay for their education
won‘t need to bother complying with the regulations — on-
ly people wltose education depends on grants and loans
from the federal government will be harrassed by this law.
This hits minority students especially hard. because
minorities are rrtore dependent on financial aid than the
general population. This selective persecution is blatantly
unfair. and is probably illegal — if not unconstitutional.

Financial aid administrators are certainly not crazy about
ttte new laws. Instead of lettingthcm help students get
through school. the government is reqrtiring them to
become police and enforce the draft registration law.
Almost all financial aid offices are already backlogged with
thousands of financial aid forms. student loan forms. arid
various other paperwork to process. and this new paper-
work will rttake it virtually impossible for tlterrt to get
anything dotte.

There are alternatives to simply accepting the demands of
the regulations. There's a cltattcc that a lawsuit in Mirr-

O L U M

'neapolis may end the regulations. brrt it will certainly be
dragged through appeals -— perhaps all the way to the
Supreme Court. Students In colleges all over the country
are pressuring their administrations to publicly speak out
against the Solomon. Amendment. and some schools are
saying that they will refuse to eontply with the law. In addi-
tion. the United States Stttderit Association and litany other
strident organizations are working to have (‘I'ttgress pass a
law abolishing these reactionary regulations.

Part of this lobbying activity is takittg place in Albany,
and Student Association is taking an active role in it. Cert.
tral Council passed a resolution Wednesday strongly urging
Congress to repeal the law. SA's fortnightly ttewsletter. The
Slade/it Voice, devoted nearly ltalf of its last issue to art c\-
cellcnt set of articles on draft registration and the Solomon
Amendment. The Student Actiott Committee of Cetrtral
Council is helping organize a coalition of studertt groups
opposed to this measure. This is the first tinte itt recent
history that SA has worked so hard on such an important
issue. attd it's a welcome change.

Iiut the Solotttort Amendment is still facing millions of
college students. It is important that this repressive piccc ol
legislation is repealed. but that will only happen if enough
pressrtc is placed on Congress. Letters. rallies turd making
sure ortr ttnivcrsity takes art assertive. prtblic stand against
this law. It’s tip to us.

Gunning for control

There lrrrks iii the mind of today's progressive liberal a
dark and foreboding threat to art inherent Constitutional
freedom: the spcetor of grrrt control.

(inn control means lite registration. regulation. and the
inevitable bartrtirtg of handguns in the ltope that the mere
rcdrtction of these weapons will substantially reduce the
ever-escalating critttc rate in ortr society.

.
i Davrd Ross
lf statistics are to be trusted. less than one half of one
pcrccttt of all handgun owners misuse their guns. of which
tltcrc arc tttorc titan fifty tttilliott itt lite United States today.
This means that one ottt of every three Americans. age six-

 

' teen or older. are handgun owners (on tlte average). A law

hannittg handguns would be both impractical attd unen—
forccnhlc. A recettt ttational poll rctcaled a very conscr-
vative estimate of about fifty perccttt of all current ham»
dgun owners would boycott srtclt a btttt. ‘

.lailing just one percent of those likely to resist is far
beyond the capacity oforrr present prison system. This nou-
conforntity would be corttparahlc to the large settle civil
disobedience associated with a previous attempt by
legislators to ban another deeply valued commodity:
alcohol. Once again. faced with citi/ens blatantly igrtoting
such insidious arid misdirected l'gislatiou as itt the l920's.
our lawmakers would be faced with the dismal failure of art
atttigrm law. Didn't antigun Liberals learn front this traves-
ty of justice? Art intelligent society learns frorn its mistakes;
some of us obvioust have ttot.

Isn't it trrtc that when grins arc outlawed only outlaws
will have them? Tltcrt why do these people persist with such
ideological and impractical legislation? Perhaps they scck
art oversimplified anti all conclusive solution to art in-
credibly complex prohlcttt itt society: the causes of violent
critnc.

They cltoosc to ignore facts. They cling blindly to thc att-
tigutt crusade like flies cling to dtrttg. They inc\plicah|y
believe that social evils like \iolent crimc. alcohol and drug
abrrsc are caused by tltc availability of certain weapons or
drugs. rather than by tltc socioeconomic conditions present
in our society which produces people ittclincd to misuse
tltcm. Tltcy also believe that by eliminating the weapon or
drug these social evils will correspondingly be reduced or

eliminated. What these idealisls fail to realize is that gtttts

don't kill people: people do.

Studies at the University of Wisconsin. Cambridge
University and Harvard University conclude that grtn eon<
trol laws have no individual or collective effect itt redrtcittg
the rate of violent crime and that social and cultural levels.
not gun corttrol. determine critttc levels. The Wisconsin
study compared tltc homicide rates to the rates of handgun
owrrcrsitip. state by state. and found N0 correlation. This
means that homicide rates don't decrease as handgun
decreases. nor do tltcy Increase as rates of ltandgtttt owner-
ship increase. This finding invalidates tltc basic argument of
the grin prohibitionists: fewer guns doesn't mean fewer in-
cidents of crime. ltt light of this rcvclatiort. gun control cart
be viewed as a pointless diversion of lcgislators' time anti
cttcrgy away frotn tltc crux of the problem: our society
itself. not guns.

There is yet another powerful reason to oppose grin cort-
trol: it violates orrr civil liberties as Urtitcd States citizens.
The basis of a free arid democratic society is a simple one:
to represent the people. their needs and desires and to in-
sure inalienable rights. Among these ittalienable rights is the
ability to defend oneself, with a handgun if necessary.
Owning a gun is an Americh birthright and no abider of
the U.S. Constitution will tolerate any infringement on tltc
rigltt to bear arms. The philosophy behind all unarmed a‘nd
vrrlnerablc citt/cn is a grossly warped interpretation of this
civil right. is the politictrl .ttottslt'osity the product of the
American people‘.’ Any governing body that seeks to render
its constituents unnecessarily susceptible to critttc is
dcfeatittg its purpose and is obsolete. if the govcrtttttcttl
doesn't trust us with our gutts. should we trust them with
theirs'.’

l’oliticos are jumping on the anti-gun bandwagon in an
effort to corral support. as most voters incorrectly equate
gun control with rcdrtced crime. The ringleader of contem-
porary anti-gunners is rtottc otltcr than Senator Edwsrd
Kennedy. a man whose family has been decimated by guns.
llis understandable personal bias of guns ltas spilled over
into the political arena. but his surrealistic goals of nation-
wide gun confiscation have been ltaltcd largely by tile ef-
forts of the National Rifle Association (NRA). a pro—gun
organization with .about two tttilliott members
nationwide. l'icadquartcred itt Washington l).C., they are

an extremely poteu. iobbyirtg force in Congress and lime
successfully tltwartcd anti-gun legislation. The NRA re-
mains tornorrow's insurance against today's misinformed.

Art article in Newsweek stated “ducks at dawn" have a
better chance of weathering the storm titan proposed gtttt
control legislation. The NRA is to be cotntrtettdcd for its
valiant fight agaittsl ignorance and totalitarianism.

Frighteningly. the cottfidcttcc of Americans itt police pro-
tectiott is diminishing to alarmng levels. Cili/cns arming
themselves is becoming contrtrortplace itr high crime lones.
Vigilante forces are on the rise. the most prominent being
the Guardian Angels. civilians who “police” the \uhwuys
and other dangerous areas itt our large cities. The reason is
scary: tltc mcit in blue aren't \‘cry effective. If tltc police
can‘t effectively protect us. sltttll we strip the Ameticun
citizen of a very cffecti\c means of doing so?

Obviously gtttts will always be available to those that
desire them. as are drugs and other black market goods.
Tryittg to disarm the American criminal is at best a
misdirected and foolhatdy effort. Since tltc guns are
already out there, gun control legislation is like closing the
burn door after tltc horse got out. Legislation directed at
the leniency of our courts. as well as a nationwide reinstate-
tttertt of the death penalty. would be vastly tttorc cffcctitc
than tncrc gtttt control. Don‘t tttakc it any easier for tltc
tnodertt critttittal to ltavc his way: protect yourself before
it‘s too late.
