ack in December_ John R. decid-

ed that working In The O.K.

Tavern was trot a copasetic place
for meeting women. John, a bartender
from Queens. had been somewhat
depressed recently over the break-up with
his girlfriend. Anita. With no where else to
turn to. John returned to his childhood
friend Oscar. Months earlier. Oscar's
girlfriend threw him out. Since then he has
learned that a man makes his own oppor-
tunities. Being an avid reader of The
Village Voice. Oscar suggested to John
that he put an ad iii the papers' classified
section. Lots of people placed personals in
the paper and believing that Voice readers
don't play games. John decided to go for
it. in January the responses started coming
in. There were a lot of them. Actually John
wasn't surprised for he realized that his ad
was rather appealing.

Debbie Millman
and

Rob O’Connor

He spent days mulling over the letters
Upon receiving a particular response from
a woman named Diana. he stopped mull‘
irrg. Describing herself as an attractrve.
stimulating brunette in her early twenties.
she was eager for intelligent conversations.
cultural diversity. and fun. .lohn liked furr.

He phoned her to secure a date; she ac-
cepted. They discussed the rendezvous: he
would pick her up at work. from there they
would decide what next. Tire following
stories describe the events. dialogues. and
thoughts of the ensuing evening accordlrrg

his whole personal ad idea wasn't

really mine. Oscar gave me one

of those I‘when you fall off a
trorse' raps and l fell for it. You see. Anita.
my ex. broke it off with me a couple of
nronths ago and Osc insists I don't become
socrally stagnated l can't believe l'rrr allow«
iirg Osc to assist me in my personal affairs. i
let him set me up once betore. Before I
agreed however. I inquired about the
woniair Osc said she held a steady position
that included travelling. She was a god-
damn teanrster!

 

 

 

His Story

l think dating is useless. Think about it.
When 1 go out on a first date l'rrr the exact
opposite of my true Sell: I wear clothes I
wouldn't wear normally. l'rrr polite. 1 par-
ticipate iir conversation of no interest to me
and I pay my own way. Now what am I
supposed to think if the woman hates me
after otir first date. Will she love the real
me?

 

l'm so confused it's not funny. I guess its
because I never learned how to date I've
had about five dates my whole life. Osc said
the reason l'm so selective is because my
expectations are too high. He says when
you're desperate enough to blind date you
should have no expectations whatsoever
As therapy he forced me to put a personal
ad in the Village Voice to get me on track.
Alter a while this girl Diana called and we
tirade a date.

The days preceding the date were filled
with contemplation concerning plans for
the evening. sophisticated behavioral
strategies etc. Finally l thought. what the
hell am I doing? Don't use facades. Be
honest. Just be hottest.

On the train ride to. pick up Diana, ald'

 

advice echoed througtr my brain. “No ex—
pectations whatsoever." What a strange
notion. I wondered if l'm not to have any
expectations tonight. and she deesn't show
up. arrr l supposed to be satisfied?

Just be honest

We met at her job at Tutti). I made no
previous arrangements. I thought I would
feel her out and adapt accordingly. She
wanted to go to sortie museum. I said “it's
cheap. what the hell." l was being honest.

The last museum I had been to was the
American Museum of Natural History for
my ()th grade class trip. And believe me
museum's have gotten weird since sixth
grade She seemed to like art and knew
alot about it She wasn't pompous about
her knowledge; she wanted to share. I
didn't wairt her to think I was a blockhead
so 1 tried to participate in the corrversatloir.
l threw some bull to her about some artist
she was rambling on about. Sayzon or
somebody.

As she gazed at a totally black painting 1
got to get my first good look at her Very
sophisticated appearance. With a per-
sonality to match 1 thought I better start
saying sorrretlring so I switched the lulling
conversation away lroirr art
