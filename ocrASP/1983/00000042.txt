Local groups scmtinizing
Judicial system’s policies

.ludge lidward Conway at their five-

ln Alharty. the courts are on trial.

Twenty-five local citizens, who
call themselves the Coalition of
Court Observers. began observing
Albany Criminal (‘0an Jan. 3t
attd \vill contitntc to do so on a daily
basis for the next tltrce tnonths to
“provide a presence iii the cour-
troom as concerned citi/cns. to
cdttcate tltetttsclves and the corn-
tnrrttity about the operation of the
courts. to assess court procedure
and organi/ution. anrl to assure that
the legal and human ttccds of corn-
plainants and defendants are being
recogni/ed and met.“ according to
Coalition spokeswoman Ann litan-
don.

“The group will he \oluntccring
one to four hortrs per week for a
three tnoutlt period.“ said llratt-
don. “At tlte end their findings will
be released to the general public."
The organization in charge of the
event is the Fund for Modern
Courts. which is a statewide court
reform organization. The Fund has
already monitored Albany Family
Court and Police Court, according
to Brandon.

Administrative Judge Edward
Conway expressed the prevalent
feeling of the law representatives in
attendance, saying. “We welcome
court observers. It is rare that
anyone comes to the courtroom just
to observe. today." Conway ex-
pressed his concern that the courts
have, “lost their dignity." and said.
"it is a good thing that the general
public see. hear. and report what is
going on. It has an effect on the
conduct of the court."

Groups which have represen-
latich in the court monitoring
grottp inclttdc the Albany County
League of Women Voters. Albany
llranch of tire American Associa-
tion (which provides counseling to
prisoners and their families). Arbor
House Day Program. Friends
Meeting of Albany. Fund for
Modern Courts. Christians llnilcd
in Mission. NAACP. Roman
Catholic .luil Ministry. Sisters ol
Sacred Heart, atttl Siena College.

The group. diverse in ages and
occupations. heard speakers on the
proceedings of the Criminal Court

sion Saturday. A barrage of legalese
confronted tltctn there: misde—
mcancrs. Grand Jury. arraigttrnent.
indictment. suppression. pre-tritrl
hearing. pre—trial motions. and
Superior Court inforrnalion were
all rlefincd.

Court Monitor Cltris Sheridan
expressed the group's common”
reaction tltat. "liven ifl don‘t learn
arty more about the courts titan i
learned today. it's still more than l
knew before."

(‘out't watchers were also in-
troduced to legal dilemmas such as
those presented by sentencing. pica
bargaining. jury selection. and tire
roles of the judge and attorney.

\\’Iti|c Cornvav described the two
Criminal Court Judges. Joseph
Harris and John .I. Clync. as. “fun-
tastic." Public Defender l’elcr Por-
co took the opposite side. “They
are tough. but fair." Conway said.
“Judge (‘lync t'ccls everyone should
get the maximum sentence because
he wants a uniform statewide
system of punishment. He issues a
lesser sentence if the situation war-
rants it. There is nothing wrong
with giving the maximum sentence.
The law provides for it."

Porco. however. pointed out.
“There is a move now to reform
sentencing. i don't think the way to
achieve uniformity is to give
everyone a maximum sentence." As
an example. he cited the case of a
college student with no prior brush
with the law who was given the
maximum sentence for selling a half
a gram of cocaine while drunk. “I
think prison is over-used in this
country.".s‘aid Porco. “i don‘t think
that's fair that a first titnc drug-
offender goes to prison."

Like Conway. District Attorrtcy
Sol Greenhcrg had high praise for
l-lart'is' and Clync's harsh scttlcttc~
ing, (irccnbcrg said. “Crimes of

Block links atoms to industry

Research could lead to cancer cure

 

By Liz Reich
sr/rrr u-mrmr

Chemistry Professor Eric Block
has found a way to attach atoms in
an efficient manner. using inexpen-
sive commodities. a discovery
which may lead to industrial ap-
plications in the synthesis of such
materials as anti-cancer agents.
plastics. polymers. drttgs. and in-
secticides.

Block said. “We're developing
procedures for it certain type of
molecular construction which could
have application in the area of
cancer. The molecule I have may be
something that causes cancer rather
than crtrcs it. Sometimes knowing
the nature of a disease leads to the
cure."

Mitch Goldstcin. a student
researchng with Dr. Block said
Dr. Block is investigating "a
chemical similar to sottlclltitlg that
causes stomach cancer. We're not
'doing research on cancer therapy."
added Goldstcin. “We're looking

for a cheaper way of making
suspected cancer-causing corn-
poncnts."

ed to link the extra atom. “are the
waste products of chemical ln-
dustry." according to Block. “We
use chemicals such as hydrogen
sulﬁde; which is typically a waste
product. and formaldehyde. com-
modities which are available in vast
quantities."

In regard to the subsequent
dangers of his research materials.
Block said. “We have five efficient
hoods for the fumes, and a safety
engineer ill the building who in-
structs us in safety procedures."
There are more hazards in the use
of chemicals in other departments.
Tltc chemistry department has a
good appreciation for how
dangerous chemicals are."

lllock's research is funded by a
3330.000 grant from the American
Chemical Society‘s Petroleum
Research Fund and a $l40.()00
grant from the National Science
Foundation. "Grants are the bear-
lttcite of academic research." lllock
said. “We have tremendous dif-
ficulty in finding money. We‘re for-
tunate to have the grants. bttt they
are scrutinized carefully. All agen-
cies give the minimum amount of
money necessary." The money goes

Iilock. "We would like to try to
build bridges to large corporations
to convince them that New York
State doesn't give us any more
money than private schools such as
RPI get."

lllock's stuff consists of two post
doctorates. three graduate students
and two undergraduates. Block
said. "Every Friday we have a
meeting where we sit down and talk
about what each person has done."
in addition. the Chemistry Depart-
ment also discusses their research
progress. Chemistry Department
Chair Henry Kuiviln said he is not
familiar with the specifics of Dr.
Illock's research. but said they will
be tnceting soon to discuss it.

liloek is a specialist in synthetic
organic chemistry. having worked
m that field for twenty years. He
came to SUNYA after l4 years at
the Unive’rsity of Missouri at St.
Louis. He earned ltls doctorate at
Harvard. llloek gives 30 lectures
around the country annually. works
with lawyers on environmental
crises. writes for the Encyclopedia
Britannica. and is the author of a
hook and more than 50 other
publications on organic chemistry.
