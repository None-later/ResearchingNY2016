German program ranks in tap ten

German doctoral program In the
SUNY system. Furthermore. the
program was ranked the highest of
any Immunities department in the
system.

Albany's program is approx-
imately ten years old according to
Dr. Bcliarricll. and presently con-
sists of seven faculty members in-
cluding Dr. Ulrich Machc. Dr.
Wolfgang W. Mocllckcn. Dr. John
M. Spitlck. Dr. Joseph I’. Strclklt.
Dr. Wolfgang Wittkowski and Dr.
Erna M. Moore.

SUNYA‘s German program was
named along with Cornell.
Princeton and Virginia its the four
German doctoral programs as
“most Improved in program quali-
ty" over the last five years. Tltc
program rlttcd higher than larger

 

and older doctoral programs such
as Illinois. Massachusetts.
Michigan. Northwestern. Chicago.
and Pennsylvania. Five years ago.
Albany's program was not even
mentioned in the survey. according
to Dr. Beharricll. il professor in

gram.

The survey is the second of five

lion in the United States conduct by

X-rated opposition

<Front Page

Randy Gicr said. “I think pcoplc
on campus are adults and are old
cnough to make a decision about
whether to see on X-rulcd film and
are mature enough to handle
themselves afterward. I found Bad
Girls humorous and I had lto fccl-
ings about commitllig ll violent sex
act afterward. The film actually
portrayed men as morons making a
mockery of the men who were ac-
ting likc mnlc chuuvonistsl"

Marcy Sccklcr believed that
X-ratcd films should be shown on
campus. "A person will only view
them as putting women in it bad
light it‘ they're predisposed to think-
ing that way. I don‘t think it will
change a person's llttitildcs but it
may rcint'ot'cc what someone
already bclicvcs. Mriybc I'm not
sensitive to vicwing such tttovics :15
ot't‘cnsivc. bill I don‘t really hclicvc
they portray womcn in it tcrrihlc
ff» way."

,1”: Carla Oxcttbcrg sllid she doesn't

* hclicvc tllcy should hc shown on
campus because the few who enjoy
tllcm can go sontchwcrc clsc to scc
them and they will oft‘cntl it lot
more people.

Lewis (‘rlitscr said tlic films
should be shown since. “people can
make their own choicc about
\vllcthcr to ace tllclll. It‘s not a
privacy invasion. I don't think pco-
; pic are more inclincd aflcr viewing
‘ i one. to commit a violent sex crime.
someone capable of that doesn‘t
nccd erotic material to trigger tllcir
‘ bcllnvior."

 Charles Issues noted that. “I
I' don't think that just by virtue of its

being erotic material that it has tin
[1 effect on attitudes towards women.
" however. the erotic material is
" symptomatic of the attitudes
 toward women." I I
