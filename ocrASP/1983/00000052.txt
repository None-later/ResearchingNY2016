By Margo Bartholomew

 

The teacher. who gives all A's does not exist only In the ‘

fantasies of students. He is Educational Psychology Pro-
fessor Theodore Bayer, and his classes are always full.

Actually, Baycr's students also have the option of
receiving an incomplete. but if they get one. they can
work for the A as many times as necessary. or end up with
a D as a final grade. Bayer calls his technique Mastery
Learning.

Among the objectives or the grading system. Prof.
Bayer capitalich on the fact that it eliminates curving
grades and also rcdttccs anxiety and game-playing. “This
way students have to study for every tcst instead of fool-
ing around." he said. “Normally. il‘ a student gets an A
on one test. he thinks he can afford not to study on the
next test." In his practicing of the Mastery Learning
system. Bayer is considers himself fortunate in that
“Students don‘t call up the night before an exam making
death-bed excuses."

The basis of his principle. he says. is to reduce anxiety
and failure due to competition and low effort. "In-
dividual differences are taken care of through cxtcnding
the time." explained Bayer. “It doesn't seem fair for a
person to be placed in a competitive situation like this
when it‘ given ntorc time. the person could assimilate the

Bayer’s students receive no lees than an ‘A ’

knowledge."

- Although his grading system is not widely used. it is ap-
proximately 20 years old. Bnycr said that lie initiated it
here reinforced by Skinncrian Psychology and. he added
jokingly. "When I got tenure." He said he feels that most
professors will not adopt his system because they are
historically conditioned. There is a commonly held in-
ference. he says. that high performance is related to low
quantity. If everyone got A‘s, then they are not as smart.
He says that having a lot of successful students is not con-
sldcrcd normal. and therefore it makes most teachers un-

comfortable.

Most teachers do in fact disagree with Bayer. Leonard
Gordon, of Rcscarch Methods and Mcasuremcnts of
Education. disagreed with Buyer‘s philosophy and its ef-
fectiveness. He said that the Mastery Learning system is
effective for simple subject matter. but not in college.
mainly because tltc concept is the some as that ol' profi-
cicncy tcsts. which establish a low standard. bttt do not
permit assessment of degrees of performance. The diversi-
ty in degrees of ability and the amount of work one docs,
he said. yields accomplishment. “In using that method of
grading." said Gordon. "you can't really distinguish bet-
ween people. which is tltc purpose of grading." It

obscures varytng degrees of accomplishment and awards
mediocrity."

 

 
  
   

English Professor Richard Goldman said that in the
past. he had learned more from the courses where he
received C's than from the courses where he received A's.
The predominant grading system Is valuable because it is a
good measure of aptitude. he said. Goldman asserted that
in the real world. one does not often get second chances.
“Peoplc'think that that system is being kind to students
although it is ready being quite cruel." he said, “because
it gives tltc impression that students can do a task over
and over and get an A. which usually stands for ex-
cellence." For Goldman. a student should do things ,
repeatedly not to get an A. but to do it right.

Another professor. who declined to have her name
mentioned. said the grading system should depend on an
nstructor‘s objectives in the course.

As far its an easy A goes. Bayer said that most students
come to tire course with the wrong idea. More papers are
assigned and more tests are given than conventional
courses. He said he feels that most students accept this ar-
rangcmcnt readily. especially since it is an elective.

Asked about Baycr's classes. Sharon Weissman. a
graduate student. said. "I really liked it. It is subversive
teaching ill a positive way." Another student. Ralph
Volk. said. “lftherc is leniency in this course. I'm not go-
ing to light it. I'm going to sit back and learn." 5
