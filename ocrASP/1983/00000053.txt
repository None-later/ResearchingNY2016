Five Quad still hunts for a heme

 

By Suzanne Abels V

.‘t‘ I‘ll/"I" ll'RI'I‘lz'It

Five Quad Volunteer Ambulace Service's search for
their won permanent base is still in progress after two

years of debate and false starts.

Presidertt of Five Quad. Debra Putzcr.sald “Presi-
dent O'Lcary has okayed tlte proposed construction,"
and "this project has the full backing of Five Quad's

Board of Directors." ‘

Putzcr stated the reason for the construction of the
strttcttrre would be "to provide a garage for tire two
ambulartces (worth abottt $40,000 a piece) and to
create better quarters and more space for the crew."

 

Presently. the arnbulrtnces are parked outside of Col-
onial Ouad and “Leaving them outdoors deteriorates
the ' ' and decreases their life." site said.

Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and advisor to the
group Henry Kircitner claims “this project has beert in
the works for two years and is not expected to be con-
trtrcted for some time." Kircltner agreed with Putter
on the need for the strtrcture but added. “We‘ve also
had varrdttiism and as we upgrade our cquipntcnt. all
the more reason to take good care of it."

There irave been many obstacles hampering the cf-
forts of the group, Kircltncr explained. such as “per-
mission to build. qtrcstions on utilities. approval on
building plans and construction funds are all pro—
blems." Additionally. he mentioned “the need for
sufficient funds. New York State approval for corr-
strucilon on state property and idcal location," saying
these are just sorrte ol' the probierns facing i-‘ive Quad's
proposed facility.

“Things are moving slowly arid we hope to get
lltittgs off the ground snort." Kirchner stlitl.

in dealing with one dilemma. Kirchner claimed
"\tc'vc ruled out many locations but we hope to [mild
in close proximity to lltc Infirmary."

Melody Whilc. volnntccr' tlispttlcltcr I'or' l"ivc quad.
cotttrttctttcd that “building a separate facility could
give us more room to work efficiently." According to
Put/er, "l‘ivc Qtutd‘s 90 member squad is trying to gct

staff to help fund this projcct."

Bottle Bill implementation returning problems

other states that the distributors
were creating unreasonable

demands on dealers and other
redemption centers by not reclaim-
ing containers for two to three men-
ths at a time. This was forcing
many small dealers with less capital
and storage space out of business.

NYPIRG charged in a newlettcr
printed after the bill was signed into
law, that “no sooner had the gover-
nor signed the bill titan the industry
began planning a delay to weaken
or repeal it."

Frank O'Connor. program
associate for the business council of
the state of New York. said that the
council "would support a delay" of
implementation because the in-
dustry needs more time to prepare
for the law. Industry proponents
point out that the regulations front
the DEC will not be put out urttii
April 1983. thus giving thcrtt only
tltrcc months to get ready for lots
plcmcntation.

l
Another topic for discussion at. For the environmentalists and

the hearing is a proposed amend-
ment to the law that concerns the
prohibition of the use of plastic
loops known as "high cone"
packaging that holds six cans
together. it was felt that high
cones, which have no recycling
value. were prone to becoming en-
vironmentally damaging litter.

But according to the Office of
Developmental Planning's (ODP)
report on the pros and cons of
deposit legislation for the state. a
biodegradable plastic high cone of
the type used in the state of Ver-
mont would not have any detrimen-
tal effects on the environment.

The 'eport also said that ill the
slate of Michigan retailers have
started a new practice there. (‘ans
are now bcirtg returned rci‘ttstcncd
to the high cone plastic as cort-
sumcrs find it an easier way to hart—
die the rcturnublcs.

 

state.

other proponents of the bill. it has
been a long ten years that they feel
is finally corrtirrg to a close. inn
retailers are usually outspokett
against the bill because of the
burden they say it will place on
than “We will have extra accoun-
ting. more trtrcks on tltc road and
ntore work to do; there are no ad—
vantages with this law." said a
spokesman from Star Markets. a
local retail chain.

One of the main difficulties
among the distributors, said Sun-
torclli, is that there are different
laws in different states. Here in the
northeast, and as distributors. they
must serve tltcrtt all front one loca-
tiort. “The accounting is very dif-
ficult because of tire diffcrcnt t'ttlcs

If the area wants to control

“I know the students will make a

students." \‘Vhalcs said.

liirtghamtort student government
leaders, however. have questioned
tltc tuition bikes. The main objec-
tion to Clark's proposal is the lack
of consideration given to other
alternatives.

According to llinghamtorr I’i/rt'
Drawn News Editor (terry Mullauy.
the SUNY iiirtghamtou Strident
Association Executive Council has
taken a stand against the differen-
tial tuition proposal because they
feel that tltc legislature's changes to

nccd for a tuition hike. Assembly
Speaker Stanley i-‘ink ltrts suggested

Confusion surrounding the new
admission requirements for Corn-
ptrtcr Science and Applied
Mathematics was cleared up irt a
rttcrnorandurn released Feb. .1 by
stating that the new requirements
apply only to students admitted to
the university III'tcr tltc Spring 1982
semester or those desiring to enter
one of tire programs after Fall i983.

’l‘hc major points of the
memorandum. writlcrt by Associate
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Leonard Lapinski states that the
cumulative grade point average for
the fotrr required courses has been
raiscd front 2.75 to 3.25. Core
courses may no longer be taken
S/U. arid if a core course is
rcpcatcd in ordcr to get a higher
grade, both grades rcccivcd iIt tltc
course will be figurcd in tltc core
course average. in the piisl‘ tltc
higher of tltc grades was tthcplctI.

quircmcnts sL‘CliiL'tI to In: the major

plained. He said CUE advlsors told
students that the new rcqtrircments
would apply only to students ac~
ccptcd at SUNYA for the Fall '82
semester aml after. but tltc averag-
ing of grades for repeated courses
was to begin this semester.

The fairness of establishing this
policy withottt prior warrtirtg was
questioned by many students. Ed
Schunk, a sophomorc. appealed his
case to the Department of
Undergraduate Studies. lie claimed
that if the policy was enacted this
semester. it would rtot be fair to
students who could have repeated a
cotrrsc and received the higher
grade for it. but didn‘t because they
had no idea they wouldn't be able
to do so this semester.

As a result of this appeal. the
department reviewed the rc-
qtrircmcnts. and realized that they
had bccrt misinterpreted. Lapinski
said that “Ito onc itt particular”
was responsible for the mix up. “In
the general confusion of IItc beginn-
ing ol the semester. with different
people giving out dil'i'crcnt informa»

According to Former Computer

Arden says that stricter re-
