side his office window reminded Joe that
winter was still here. A knock upon his
door reminds Agent X that he is at work.
"Come in whoever you are. i know that
you are there for l've heard you knock."
Turning in his chair so that he is facing the
door X wonders...

“Excuse me. sir. this gentleman Insisted
upon seeing you." My secretary is redder
than any herring would dare think of
becoming.

"i‘li see the gentleman. Miss Wilson.
Thank you. You have the ‘ _, over
me. old fellow. So perhaps you can start
out by telling me your name and the exact
nature of your business. Or at least the part
of, your business most pertinent to this
meeting." A tall. relatively thin. middle ag-
ed man stood before Agent X. His clothing
and his manner seemed almost Victorian.

“My name is W. R. Edwards. I'm in the
publishing business. That. however. has lit-
tie or nothing to do with the reason why i
wish to speak with you, i knew the leader
of this operation when we both were
younger and attended Eaton. Mr. Ed-
wards spoke the word Eaton as though he
had mentioned the name of the queen.

“Excuse me. Mr. Edwards but l'm still
not clear on how i might be of assistance to
you."

“i must apologize for the mystery that
l've placed you in. Hopefully i'ii make
myself more clear as i go on.

Nothing comes easy in this life and if this
guy does not make my life any easier l
guess that is just par for the course. im-
agine that. Mr. Edwards and the cheese at
Eaton. A real small world if you ask me.

"Mr. Edwards did my boss send you
here to see me?"

"Old Teddy Bear was right. you are a
smart one. You see. X. I had to be sure
that he was correct in his opinion of you.
This manner of introduction was staged sol
would get a better look at your ability to
think under pressure."

“Mr. Edwards, now that you feel better
about my talents. would you mind 'spiliing
the beans'? Time is my boss in my line of
work." This guy is a regular riot. maybe we
should invite him to the Christmas office
party so he can tell us some more about
“Old Teddy Bear".

"What would you think if a woman you
were interested on suddenly stops having
anything to do with you? Then two weeks
later she is back at your door asking to
return to the place she once held in your
heart. I'm not that wise when it comes to

"I say there Old Teddy Bear was right
about you, You are quick upon the up-'

Just what I needed some poor slob can't

ing semester at the Performing

Arts Center—the Don Rediich
Dance Company. Presented by SUNYA's
Dance Council. this energetic company of
five (which includes founder Don Redlich)
will appear for only one night. February
11. on the PAC main stage.

Donna MacMiIlan

_________._._..__—————

Don Redlich has developed a reputation
for presenting fresh. innovative
choreography that develops within the
framework of traditional theater. The com-
pany's modern dance roots are the work of
German expressionist dancer Mary
Wigman and several of their major works
have been ‘choreographed by Hanya
Holm. one of Wigman's disciples Miss
Holm. whose credits include the
choreography of the musicals "Kiss Me
Kate". “My Fair Lady". and “Camelot”
choose to train her students to develop
their sense of movement individually. in-
stead of following a rigid. codified method
of dance.

Thus. the Don Redlich Dance Company
performs works which. although abstract.
are emotionally involving. rich. and lively
in the face of the sterile technicality which
characterizes many other avant-garde
dance companies.

Emotions are as important as technique
in Redlich's work—humor. pain. and joy
translate through the various dance pieces.
in an interview conducted for the Bergen
County Record a year ago. Reditch stated.
“(Dancei has gravitated toward a very
cerebral approach to work and experience.
which is sad. I mean emotion has become a
dirty word. Maybe the pendulum will swing
back. But l don't think one is going to be
moved unless one has an emotional ex-
perience."

Redlich. a student of Hanya Holm. is
especially noted for his flexibility and vitali-
ty onstage. One of the pieces in the com—
pany's repertoire. "Passin' Through” is a
solo performed by Redilch. and has
become a signature piece for him. Clad in a
bright striped shirt and a soft hat. Redlich
twists and whirlsto American folk music.

wards had more light bulbs loose than the
local library. No matter. the cheese sent
him to me. so i must find some way of
helping him cope with the affairs of the
heart. Now. all i had to do was to find so-
meone who could help me get over the
severe headache and heartburn i'm sure
this business was about to give me. “That'li
be all right with me. See you at 8. unless
there is something else you wish to discuss
with me. Mr. Edwards...Mr. Edwards is
everything all right?" Everything was not all
right and Agent X knew it. Perhaps it was
the gun that Mr. Edwards had pointed at
the top of his tread. Shock was the least of
his probierms. for X knew that this mad
man was intent of talking for a while before
he pulled the trigger. “Mr. Edwards don't
you think it would be a good idea to put
that gun away? You're not going to solve
any of yuour problems that way. Would
you like to talk this thing out?" X knew that
his only chance would be if he could
somehow get Mr. Edwards talking long
enough so that he (Mr. Edwards) could
touch upon the subject that was eating
away at him.

"That's awfully nice of you Agent X. but.
l'm really not interested in stopping the
plan I came to enact. Every man knows
when it is time to leave this world. She has
left me once already. l don't think my poor
heart could stand the strain. Anyway i

an expression then proceeded to pump his
head full of lead (or at least what was left of
his head). Bits of bone marrow. blood. skin
tissue and other numerous and for now
nameless substances raced passed Agent X
and redecorated his (Agent X) body as well
as the office around him.

Only the sound
of water running brought Agent X back to
the here and now. The sound of a pool of
water beginning to form at his feet. Nor~

these circumstances. for now. however X
was just glad that he could feel anything.
Anything remotely associated with the day

was in shock that life had choosen to come
into his small little quiet realm to drop its
heavy load. Unlike most of us however
Agent X had some real heavy shit to
remove from his life. By next week. maybe
Agent X will find a way of telling Old Teddy

blow his fucking brains all over the carpet.
