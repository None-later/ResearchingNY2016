Obvious mistakes

To Tilt: Editor:

1 was grctrtly disturbed to read tltc column itt lust l:l'ltltt)"s
ASP. Tltc column. by Dttvid Ross. was. against tltc restric-
tiort of handguns. It did ttot tltcrcforc. surprisc tire to firtd
tltc coiurrtrt to be quite absurd.

Pcrhaps tltc worst mi. ntttdc by Mr. Ross involves.
tltc use of tltrcc scptrrtttc studies that indicutc no correlation
ltctwcctt handgun ownership and ltomocidc rules on :r sttttc
by sittlc basis. There arc two obvious dcl'ccts itt this ttrgrt-
tttcnt. In it slutc like New York. for cxuntplc. tltcrc arc 16
million pcoplc. If gun ownership itt New York was to
decline. even slightly. tltcrc might for cxatnplc be a drop of
(a very conservative cstimtttc) it) to 15 ltontocidcs. This pro-
bttbly wouldn't mukc tl dii'fcrcncc itt tcrms of u statistical
survcy. bttt it ccrtttinly would be worthwhile. As :tuothcr
cxamplc. one might ttsk what would have lttrppcncd if John
|.cnnon's :tssasin had found himself untrblc to pttrcltns- tt
httndgutt on tltc opctt murkct. l’urltttps ltc would not have
had tltc inclination to buy ottc at all. ltttd it not ltccrt so
cttsy. Would this ltuvc shown up sttttisticnlly'.’ 'l‘ltus. Mr.
Ross has missch tltc obvious poittt that. although it rttigltt
not show up statistically. gun control legihlttlitili might wcll
save lives.

Tltc second way itt which tltc studies trotted out by Mr.
Ross arc misleading is that it fails to considcr otltct coun-
tries. linglund. for cxumplc is ltcscl by ttttttty ol' tltc pro-
blcms that tltc 11.8. fuccs. including ltighcr uncmploymcnt
lttm tltc LLS. ('nnudtt ttlso faces many of tire sanic pro-
lcnts. yct both l-nglttnd and (‘ttnztdtt lutvc mntutgcd to cf-
'cctivcly bun handguns and both linglund and Canada have
owcr hornocidc rtrtcs than the LLS. l mu not. of coursc.
trying Ilutt Iltcrc would it: u precipitous drop irt 11.5.

 

homocidc rates it' gurt control were enacted. I do think.
Iltuuglt,tltttt tltcrc would bc u drop. and i also think that
any dcclittc. cvcn if it is only one pcrson. is well worth all
the time uttd effort involved irt passing tltc lcgislation flttll
would control handguns.

Mr. Rn“ misses tltc poittt irt other wttys. Whilc ltc cor-
rcctly points out that tltcrc ttrc socioccottomic cttuscs for
violencc. he fails to consider tltc means with which \iulcncc
is t. icd out. Whilc 1 cannot speak for Mr. Ross. 1 know
that it 1 “'th tl\\tlttllcd. I would not be too [ilk‘ilkutl to find
orrt that my trwtilttnt had at ltttrtdgoun poittt of tuct. llitll
would bc tltc lint thing i would wish to find otrt.

Mr. Ross Ittttk’cs yct nnotltcr obvious mistake lutcr on lit
the :trticlc. llc sttys that gun ownership is a sacred rigltt of
the U.S. Cill/cttt‘)‘.l'lc curtlinttcs also and sttys that tltc basis
of ti frcc society is rcpr'cscnttttion of tltc citi/cttry. l'lc cott-
Iiuucs to \Irrtc that tttosl votcrs cquutc gun control with
rcduccd crimc (incorrectly. according to Mr. Ross). The oh-
vious qtrcstiort ltcrc cottcct'tts the democratic process. if tltc
majority of tltc 11.5. voters (us shown itt poll nftcr poll)
wtmt gun control. do tltcy not have a right to dcrnttnd it‘.’ Or
should it lobby such :1\ the N.R.A. b' ublc to stifle lllL‘
sinccrc wishes of lliL‘ 11.8. voters at c\cry tuttt'.’ (And I
might add ltcrc llittl tltc N.R.A. is by no means it l‘mcc
ugttinst iguot'uttcc and Iottrlitttt’itmism. or is it “today's in-
surttucc against tomorrow's misitti'ormct“ its Mr. Ross
would litivc us bclictc. it is rrty bclicf that. if anything. tltc
word "today" iii 01' above ouolc \hould bc rcplttccd with
tltc nrrmc of Smith and \\'cwtrt ot lirowrtirtg ltt ordcr to be
corrcct.)

Mr. Ross ulso sttttcs irt his column that anybody who
wants it gurt will trlwttys hc ublc to purcltttsc out: on tltc
black market. This ttguin missus truitc an obvious point.
The black murkct constitulcd. ttl l'ttst irt part. of stolen
guns (legitimrrtcly bought. of coursc). If this portion of tltc
black nutrkct wcrc rcmovcd. wouldn't tltc supply of gum
tltcrc at lcttst dcclinc'.’ And could not this dcclinc. ltotvcvct
sitittll. save lives? (or cvcn :1 life?)

Ami its far its tltc judges tit‘c cottcct'ttcd. wirich ugrcc llltlf
somc of them are lu.\ irt tltcir upplictttion of pcltttltics. this
still I 'ttvcs two points to consider: First. prisons ttrc ulrcntly
ovcrcrowdcd. and building rtcw prisons is it grcutcr cxpcnsc
titan tltc govcrmncnt is willing to make in the forscctll‘llc
I‘uturc.

Sccond. and more important. ottc must consider tltc cf-
l'cct prison has on its ittltintcs. Is it rchubilittttivc'.’ Or. us
must c\pct't\ ugtcc. docs it lcttLl to titttkc its ittttittlcs cvcrt
trtorc crimittlly ittclittcd'.’

I do not prcsutnc to offer any panucctts I'or' violcttt crime.
I do ltowevcr. tltittk it truitc evident that ii handgun is only
uscd to harm or kill pcoplc and is tltcrcforc an cvil and
dungcrous wcupon. It follows logically that any steps
towards climitrttlittg or crctt slightly reducing tltc ttrtrrtbcr of
handguns avttiluhlc would bc ncll nortltwltilc.

Rephrased objection

To tltc l-ldltor:

l'm sorry but you sccltt to lrtt\L‘ ntisxcd my point. Surc
tltc unhcrsity community is mature cnouglt to rctrd pro-
i'uuity—btrl tltc question of profanity. pct sc. was not tltc

L——_————————_

Again. my point is not so much with the use of profanity
as it was with tltc lack of professionalism in the article en-
titled “Education Gets tltc Axe." Let me try to illustrate
the point. if you are in a formal discussion about. for ex-
ample. Reagan's defense policy and someone says, “You
know. lllC dcl’cnsc's share of tire federal budget has actually
Llcclincd during tltc period 1956-77. Until. the Carter Ad-
ministration rcvcrscd this trend." and then someone cries
out. “liullshit. Rcugttn is responsible for reversing the trend
tlltd 111th ulrctrdy increased tltc dcfcnsc's share to 60
pctccnt.“ Now. it' Casper Wcirtburgcr were there. he'd
ftttL‘Htittn the man about his facts. Would you listen to such
11 person it‘ he responded by saying "Shit man. that's my
opinion?“

Along this stttttc vcin. would you take a newspaper
seriously if that were tltc sort of jounalism it allowed?

if I‘m wrong about \vltcrc tltc rcsponslbiity tics. tltcn l‘m
sorry. th. I can't ltclp but thinking that newspaper editors
have botlt llic powc ' turd rcsponsibllity to control tltc direc-
tiort u ncwspttpcr goes. As at student. I would prefer rtot to
we studcnt ncwsptrpcrs bccomc tltc “National Enquircrs of
public policy." ()h. by the way, we have free education
through high school. highly subsidized education through
graduate studies. and l'cllowsltip programs for many doc-
toral students.

ilut ugttin. it‘ I‘m wrong then allow me to rcpltrasc and
redirect my objcction by saying: opinion. lacking sotttc fac-
ltltll foundation. dcscrvcs littlc recognition—unless. of
course. we're talking about i'tnoritc ice cream ﬂavors.

A graded change

To the Editor:

1 ttppluud Mr. ('lunc's urticlc “Plus and Minus" for
highlighting what is st) obvioust a major problcnt with our
current grading system. SUNYA has trrtdoubtcdly tltc most
utchuic. uttscnsiblc. and unfair system conceivable. and it is
int outright disgrace that it hits not yct bccrt rcviscd. I have
oltcu wondered wiry this university maintains an
A.li.(‘.l).l-‘.. guiding systcnt und rtcglccts tltc adaption of
pluses :tnd minuscs. for rtttionaly tltcrc can bc Ito justifica-
tion.

‘1 o bcgin with. it puts tltc SUNYA student til it disadvan-
Ittgc lti sc\ct'u| ways. As Mr. Clunc ttotcd. when an
ctnploycr lotth art tltc incrugc of another SUNY student

how is he to dccipltcr tlutt tltcy may have identical grades?
l‘llt‘lllL‘l‘. itr applying to graduate school tltc SUNYA stu-
dent might appear the wcukcr choice because of his lower

Now sonic may argue that in tire crtd it balances off - that

Basically. tltc wholc muttcr is a case of corttrttou scnsc.

cottsidcrs the current grading system an insult to any “in-
stitution of higher education".
