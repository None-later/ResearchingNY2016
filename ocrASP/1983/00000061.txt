o my Central Council Friend.

l was In to give you a special pet-
sonai or aientlne‘s Day. but then!
wasn't sure how you would take it!
didn't know II it would make you
happy or coniusod or maybe even
make you blush. So I thought about
it lot a long time and linaliy decided
to give you one. But then I was
skeptical because i wasn't sure it
you consider me to be your Valen-
tine or not. I guess l'm askin you to
be rn Valentine so this is or s not a
spectal Valentine's Day personal
depending on whether or not you
want It to be.
