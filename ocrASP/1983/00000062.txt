The Albany Stntcjunior varsity basketball team won
their fifth consecutive gnmc Wednesday, defeating the
J.V. Hamilton Continentuls 81-63.

Albany's victory streak can be attributed to their
high powered offense. They have overang over 90
points in their last three games.

Good shooting, which the Danes have enjoyed
recently. is not the only reason for scoring a lot of
points. Albany State junior varsity head conch Barry
Cnvnnnugh has employed prcssurc defense which has
ctttlscd tl lot of turnovers by the opposing teams. The
Dunes have been able to capitalize on the other rcnms‘
mislnkcs and score on the lust break. Albrrny is nhlc to
usc good pressure dcl'cnsc throughout the game
bcctursc they have 9 pltrycrs who can conic in and be cl"-
l‘cclivc.

“We always have fresh guys in thcrc, so when the
opportunity contcs up. w‘c arr: rcudy to run." strid
Cuvunrurgh.

Albany's running gnrnc was in full gcrtr in the first
six minulcs of Wedncsduy night's gnmc. 'l‘lrcir dcl‘cnsc
during that spun was flawless its tbcy jumped out to on

points during that strctch. including two baskets ol‘l'
stcttls.
