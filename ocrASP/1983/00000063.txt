comprise the top level of the
NCAA. Looking carefully through
the standings. you can find some in-
teresting stories. and none is more
intriguing than this year's SEC
race. a logjam that had six teams
tied for first going into this week.
Untit the past couple of years. the
SEC was known as strictly a foot-
ball conference. the league that
gave us Bear Bryant. Herschel
Walker and Bert Jones. among
others. At Alabama. a job switch
from freshman football coach to
varsity basketball coach was viewed
as a demotion. while at LSU. Dale
Brown went door-to-door. giving
away purple artd gold nets to homes
with backyard hoops. in hope of
popularizing Tiger basketball. Only
at Kentucky was hardball king. that
due to the legendary Adolph Rtrpp.
All of that is in the past. however.
Once the frog of the south. SEC

great things were expected from this
club. and heading into SEC play.
the Tide was undefeated. including
a rousing 21-point win over
Georgetown in the finals of USC's
Winston Tire Classic. Two weeks
ago. Alabama went back to Los
Angeles and won at Pauley Pavilion
in a nationally televised game. So
where is Bama in the SEC stan’
dings? Dead last. with a 2-9 record.
How. you ask? Two losses by a
single point. three others by four or
less. only one over to points.
Alabama. despite its natiortal
reputation. is still a very young
team. a group that has been unable
to fill the grip left by graduated for-
ward Eddie l’hillips. now with the
Nets. In a meat grinder league like
the SEC. rrtartrrity and poise are a
must. and Alabama lacks in that
area. and that‘s why they're last.
Who will win the SEC? Georgia

Dominique Wilkins left for the

in this modern day sports world. where
so frequently do we find individual athletes
ptrtting themselves above their teamtnates.
it is refreshing to find a team where no such
situation exists. The Albany State women‘s
gymnastics team is giving the word “team”
its rightful meaning.

This past Wednesday the Danes defeated
New Paltz 141.25-9905. Their victory came
after a shocking defeat at the ltands of
perennial Division lll power Brockport last

Saturday. which gave them their first loss of
the-season. '

Against New Paltz. the women were led
by senior Elaine Glyttn artd junior Ginny
Lochmun. who finished one-two in the all
around competition with scores of 30.15
and 29.80 respectively.

Albany swept the bars. balance beam.
and floor exercise events. thanks to
outstanding performances by Glynn. who
look first in bars. second in balance beam
and second in floor exercise. Lochman.
who took first in balance beam and in Iloor
exercise. and by freshman Brenda Arm-

“We’ve made otrr hotel reservations in
Oneouta —— that's where the State Playoffs
are." Albany State women's basketball
coach Mari Warner said as her team
preparid for the final few games of their
highly successful season.

With their sights prescntly set on the
Capital District Tournament on February
l8 tutti l‘). the Danes have the New York
State Playoffs in the brick of their minds.

“The girls are thinking about the states.
You can corrnr on that." Warner stated.

However. tlterc are turrtry hurdles to ovcr~

come before Albany is assured of being
selected as one of the cigltl learns that pur-
licipate in thc playoffs which begin
February 25. Consider:
v The Danes' rccortl —— although a l2-3
rccord appears to he impressive cnotrgh to
be highly considered for post-season play.
the process is more difficttlt titan it sounds.
The selections are based not on overall
record. but on the quality of the opposi-
tion. Points are earned for cach game. and
more points are earned for wins against
teams who finish with winning records than
against teams who end up with losing
records. As a result. scheduling is very inr-
portant. and the Danes“ early-season
schedule appears to be somewhat of it
liability. according to Warner.

“We‘ve played several teams that are go—
irrg to finish under .500. Those wins are on-
ly worth one point. whereas the garlic
against Plattsburgh (which Albany lost) was
worth three points. That cotrld lturt us.“
> Difficulty of remaining schedule ——
with four games remaining on the regular
season schedule. all on tltc road. the Danes
run into extremely stiffcompetition in their
quest to improve their standing. Saturday
they visit Pace. a difficult Division ll
school. followed by a February [5 clash
with Division lll powerhouse llurtwick.

“Hartwick has earned a great deal of
respect in Division lll." Warner noted. “ll
we can beat thetn. our position will really
improve."

The Danes then face an outstanding field
in the Capital District 'l‘ournaruent. to he
held at St. Rose. Albany opens against a
much—improved Rl’l team. whom they have
defeated twice this season. “We beat them
by 20 the first time and only by 3 the second
time. They've played all freshmen sittcc
Christmas. and they have really done a nice
job since their," Warner said. The winner
then faces the wirutcr of the Union-SI. Rose
game. Both teams have played well all year.
according to Warner. plus St. Rose has the
hornccorrrt edge.
> Limited selection — of the eight open
slots. two are virtrrully locked up already.
“New Rochelle and Mauhattanville are
almost definitely going to be' chosen."
Warner cornrnenled. “They‘ve been nu-
tionally ranked all year, and they tiescrve to
be selected. Also. Cortland has played and
beatcrt a lot of Division ll schools. and they
ltave a good chance of going.” Consequent-
ly. the Danes are one of over 30 teams that
are fighting it otrt for what appear to be on-
ly five open spots.

Despite these obstacles. the Danes own tr
number of positive factors on llteir side.
One of them is the upcoming return of
senior Robin Gibson. one of the Danes‘
leading scorers before being sidelined by an
injury several games ago.

“Robin is getting better every day. Tltc

 

 

 

 

doctor said to lutve her pace herself. i plan
to use her a little bit more in each of the
next two gantes. and we hope to have hcr at
full strength for the Capital District." said
Warner. sotrrrdiug relieved to have one of
her top players back for the stretch drive.

The tough remaining schedule may prove
to be art asset. With a win against l-lurtwick
and a good showing at St. Rose. Albany
would seem to ltave pcnlxcd right at playof
trrne.

As for in r final thoughts on the l'L
rnaindcr of the season. Warner was
cautiously optimistic. “l'm \ctv pleased
with the way we've come together as a
tcarrr. We‘ve ltad our sights set on this froru
the beginrtiug of the seaon. and the time is
now. The playoff possibilities are here. lltrt
we can't afford to look ahead. Wc'w got to
play each game one at a time and hope for
the best. That‘s all we can do." i

Currently the NCAA has Albany ranked
eighth in an unofficial pole. which pleases
Duval-Spillanc. But. in order to make it to
the NCAA‘s North Eastern Regional Divi-
sion ll Championships. the learn will have
to be ranked at least sixth. There is hope
lllttl the EAIAW. the organization that held
last year‘s tournament. (in which Albany
finished sixth) will hold another tourna-
rucul this year and that Albany will be one
of the six teams invited to compete.

No matter what happens. Duval-Spillanc
is happy with the team's progress. "This is
tltc strongest learn we’ve ever ltad here at
Albany." she said.

She had good rettson to boast because her
learn rlefcatcd Division l foes l.lU and Ver-
mont. two teams Albany had pretiously
never beaten. earlier this season. Duvtrl—
Spillane. however. refuses to take the credit
for the team's rise preferring to give all the
credit to lth‘ player's.

" l‘hcy dcscnc it." she stated.

the team's best match is against MIT
and Kings college this Saturday at Iztitl at
the l,|ui\ctsity (iyrn but the big rrratclt is to
take place on February 1‘) when Keene and
Montclrrir come to visit Albany. last year
they were ranked third and sixth lit the nu—
