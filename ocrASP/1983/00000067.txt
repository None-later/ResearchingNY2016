believe that it is the Chair's Job to
set the goals of Council, explaining
that the chalr's role is to assist

- Council in choosing its own direc-

tion while being cautious not to
play too "domineering" a role. He
does not feel that this has had an ef-
fect on the number of resignations.

Fromm claimed that some people
resign because Council does not
turn out to be what they expected,
and that “a large proportion of the
people who resigned were people
who never worked.” in reference to
Nelson's work as internal Affairs
committee chair. Fromm com-
mented. “after more than half the
year. I don't think anywhere near
half the job has been done."

Both New and Nelson agree that
more of an emphasis should be put
on committee meetings, where more
things can be accomplished, rather
than the Wednesday night meetings
when all of Council meets to vote
on legislation. SA president Mikc
Corso concurs wiili this View"

Central Council resignations

Corso. a former Council
member. said the weekly meetings
are “not an integral part of Coun-
cil." He explained that often the
more successful and satisfied Coun-
cil members are those who choose a
goal. work on it independently and
in commiitee. and view ihe weekly
meetings only as the final step in
deciding on legislation. He noted
that many members do not have a
goal and find that Council is not
what they expected. Corso believes
this may be a major cause of many
resignations this year. "There is a
lack of direction. dedication. and
lime in Council this year. Too many
people think Council is only
Wednesday night." he said.

Corso contended that the lack of
dedication comes masin from peo-
ple who join Council because they
want to be able to write about it on
a resume. Fromm estimated that an
interest in putting Council on a
resume is "too large a factor for at
least 20 percent of Council.“
However. he maintained that rriorc

has been accomplished this year
than last year.

Looking at last year's records.
LaSusn said there were eight
resignations between November
and February. Off-Campus
representative Dan Robb. who 5ch-
ed on Council last year. said these
were mostly members who missed a
lot of meetings and were asked to

resign.
Robb believes that some of this
year's resignations come from

"burnout." He explained that there
is a ldl of “behind the scenes" work
to be done and many people don't
realize this before they run. He
estimated that he spends 10-15
hours a week doing Council work.

Former Off-Campus represen-
tative Bob Bugbec resigned in
December. largely because he
wanted to focus more of his atten-
tion on his studies. but he added
that frustration with Council was
also a factor. Furthermore. he said
his personal goal in Council was
“to unify the University and get a

n» <- . «wwwumﬁ»

FEBRUARYI5, I983 l'l

voice for the Wellington." and was
successful in getting the Wellington
Association established.

Bugbce noted that part of the
feeling of frustration experienced
by some members comes from be-
ing “stifled by people who say.
‘yeah. yeah, that's a good idea' and
then leave all the work to a few peo-
ple." He feels the leadership of SA
could c more successful if they
chose a goal.

Former Dutch Quad represen-
iallvc Lauren Walter. who ab-
dicated in January after serving on
Council for a year and a half. said
she resigned because she was one of
a “core group of people doing
everything," and got tired of this.
She said she didn't think Council
was accomplishing very much. She
added that "the blame shouldn't go
to the leadership." but feels there is
a need for the leadership “to sit
down and create a working plan."

LaSusa agreed with this saying.
“i think something has been lack-
ing in cohesiveness between us (the

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS 7

executive branch. Fromm and
LaSusa)." She maintained that the
lack of direction is somewhat "in-
herent" in the system. although she
and Fromm are “looking into ma-
jor changes."

A final factor which several
former members mentioned is a
poor working relationship between
the executive and legislative bran-
ches of SA. Former Indian Quad
representative April Gray served on
Council for over a year, and
believes ihai problems with the ex-
ecutive branch may have been a
partial cause for some of the
resignations. although hers was
mostly related to a different issue.

Gray criticized the executive
branch for acting in a “paternalistic
way toward Council represen-
tatives,” in that they expect iheir
bills to pass "merely because
they're from the executive branch."

Nelson and New also complain-
ed ihai the executive branch is un-
necessarily inierferlng with Council.
