Girls was a farce tltat made ttten
look foolish. “This ntovie was a
spoof—people were laugltittg. It
showed male cltattvinist pigs being
put in their place.“ Braddock said.
Mayo said that tlte movie may ltave
been farcial. but that it still sltowed
male domination. Site emphasized
that "what we are basically con~
eerned witlt is the content of
violence and bondage of women in
pornography." Making a distinc-
tion between erotica attd por-
nography. Mayo added tltat “the
issue is not a question of sex and
nudity. but rather of bondage and
slavery."

Student Activities Director Jim
Doellfeld said that the university
follow a set procedure when asked
by a filtn group to show an X-rated
film. “if the filnt ltas been declared
obscene or is pending litigation in
the courts. the movie is ttol allowed
to be shown." Doellcfeld said. ad-
ding that “if there are no cottrt ac-
tions against the film. a film group
can present the film to be seen by
attyonc who is over lll-years-old
and has a University l.l)." When
asked if tlterc was arty contteetiott
between hard-core attd soft-core

pornography and obscenity.

Doellefeld sttid. "tltere is no
specific. clear-cut articulatiott as lt‘
the definition of obscentity. 'l'ltt
Suprente Court has left it up to tlte
communities to judge what obsceni-
ty is."

lloth Feminist Alliance members
agreed that the meeting was produc—

tive and that a definite commitment
was made by Braddock to show the
other side of pornography.
Goldberg said she was satisfied with
wltat came out of the meeting. ad-
ding that “llill Braddock was anx-
ious to listen to our viewpoint." site
said adding "i will wait and see at-
titude though to see if the organiza-
tion keeps their promise." l l

Central Councrl
<7
“The role of the executive branch
infringes on,lhe legislative branch.
Mike Corso does more than his
share. He should allow for the
legislative branch to do some of the
work." Neco said.
. Fromm does not see the resigna-
tiotts as a major problem for Coun-
cil. He contettded that a smaller
group may be able to operate tttore
effectively. "A group can work
more efficiently as a smaller group
with all ltard working diligent
members. than a larger group that
consists of sottte members who
aren't as dedicated." he said.

Corso. ltowever. maintained that
the resignations are destructive to
Council because it destroys the
trend of older ttlentbcrs tetteltittg
new ones. "The new people who
cottte in don‘t have atty continuity.
They cottte itt at the end of the year
working on illlDUl‘ltlnl issues." Cor-
so said. He added tltat ltc is very
concerned about tlte fact tltat new
members attend meetings for about
two months and then vote on a one
million dollar SA httdget.

Seats vacated by resignations are
to be filled lit a iii-election which
will be heldtontortotv. i i

UUP proposes surcharge

<Fronl Page
Reilly is ttttecrtaitt.

The UUI‘ is confidettt. ltowcver.
that Cuomo's current bttdgct plans
will ttot lead to the anttiltilatiott of
SUNY. “A proposed budget is just
that—a proposal." Reilly said. "It
is subject to ntuclt debate in tlte
legislature. which ltas always been
supportive of us itt tlte past.“

The surcharge propositiott sug-
gested by the UUP and other two
unions has “a good chance" of
passing into law. Reilly believed.
“The legislature is ltighly concerned
with the quality of education lit the
state." If it reaches the executive

desk. Reilly sees “no tcasott tltc
governor would be negative on it.
He has a strong interest itt higher
education." said Reilly.

Dreseher felt. "it's too early to
tell." bttt added. "there's hospitali-
ty to itby a number of legislators."

In conjunction with SASLl. tltc
UUP has begutt its campaign to
save SUNY. which inclttdes its stip-
port at a SASU rally at the Capitol.
scheduled for Feb. 28.

The UUP is spending an
cstitttated $28,600 for bus transpor»
tation to the Capitol from 34 cant-
puses. “it's a demonstration of
solidarity." said Dreschr'r.
