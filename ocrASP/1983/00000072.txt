FEBRUARY [5. I983 ti ALBANY STUDENT PRESS 

 

Campus cinema

<3

Girls was a farce that made men
look foolish. “This movie was a
spoof—people were laughing. It
showed male cltauvinist pigs being
put in their place." Braddock said.
Mayo said that the movie may have
been farcial. but that it still showed
male domination. She emphasized
that "what we are basically con-
cerned with is the content of
violence and bondage of women In
pornography.” Making a distinc-
tion between erotica and por-
nography. Mayo added that "the
Issue is not a question of sex and
nudity. but rather of bondage and
slavery."

Student Activities Director Jim
Doellfcld said that the university
follows a set procedure when asked
by a film group to show an X-rated
ﬁlm. "If the film has been declared
obscene or is pending litigation in
the courts, the movie is not allowed
to be shown." Docllcfeld said. ad-
ding that "if there are no court ac-
tions against the film. a film group
can present the film to be seen by
anyone who is over lil-years-old
and has a University I.l)." When
asked if there was arty connection
between hard-core arid soft-core

pornography and Obscenity.

Doellefeld said. “there is ac
speciﬁc. clear-cut artictrlation as re
the definition of obscentity. Tllt
Supreme Court has left it up to the
communities to judge what obsceni-
ty is."

Both Feminist Alliance members
agreed that the meeting was produc-

tive and that a definite commitment
was made by Braddock to show the
other side of pornography.
Goldberg said site was satisfied with
what came out of the meeting. ad‘
ding that “Bill Braddock was anx-
ious to listen to our viewpoint.“ she
said adding “I will wait and see at-
titude though to see if the organizn-
lion keeps their promise." I 1

Central Council

<7
“The role of the executive branch
infringes othhc legislative branch.
Mike Corso does more than his
sltarc. He should allow for the
legislative branch to do some of the
work.“ Neco said.
. Fromm does not see the resigna-
tions as a major problem for Coun-
cil. He contended that a smaller
group may be able to operate more
effectively. "A group can work
more efficiently as a smaller group
with all hard working diligent
members, than a larger group that
consists of some members who
aren't as dedicated." he said.

Corso. however. maintained that
the resignations are destructive to
Council because it destroys the
trend of older niembers teaching
new ones. "The new people who
come in don't have arty continuity.
They come in at the end of the year
working on important issues." Cor-
so said. He added that he is very
concerned about tltc fact that new
members attend meetings for about
two months and then vote on a one
million dollar SA budget.

Seats vacated by resignations are
to be filled it) a Iii-election which
will be heldtomorrmv. [ :

UUP proposes surcharge

<Fronl Page
Reilly is urtcertain.

The UUP is confident. however.
that Cuomo‘s current budget plans
will not lead to the annihilation of
SUNY. “A proposed bttdget is just
that—a proposal." Reilly said. “It
is subject to much debate in the
legislature. which has always been
supportive of us in the past."

The surcharge proposition sug-
gested by the UUP and other two
unions has "a good chance" of
passing into law. Reilly believed.
“The legislature is highly concerned
with the quality of education in the
state." If it reaches the executive

desk. Reilly sees "no reason the
governor would be negative on it.

He has a strong interest in higher
education." said Reilly.

Drcschcr felt. “it‘s too early to
tell." bill added. “thcrc's hospitali-
ty to itby a number of legislators."

In conjunction with SASLl. the
UUP has begun its campaign to
save SUNY. which includes its stip-
port at a SASU rally at the Capitol.
scheduled for Feb. 28.

The UUP is spending an
estimated 528.600 for bus transpor-
tation to the Capitol from 34 cant-
puses. “It‘s a demonstration of
solidarity." said Drcschcr.
