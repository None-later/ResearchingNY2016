Legal Services untangles legalities of leasing.

 

By Tony Silber

EDI TORI/i l. .«i SSIS I'zl NT

_______.._._._._—_._

A student living off-campus
needs to be wary of unfair leases
and illegal landlord practices.

The Student Association Office
of Legal Services provides a wide
range of optiorts for its clients -
frorn receiving leases to represen-
ting students in corrrl.

Legal Services Director and At-
torney Mark Mishler urges strtderlts
to seek legal advice from his office.
Mishler said lte can give otlt general
advice. get illsolvcd ill disputes to
tile extent of inter'ceding on behalf
of the students. and help students
prepare a case for small claims
court which does not require a
lawyer. "In a law suit i will repre-
scrtt students." said Mishler. “This
is primarily in eviction crises." he
added, “and usually involves deal-
ing with the opposing attorneys.
talking to the landlord or the judge.
alld on a few occasions. dealing
with a trial.”

Mishler said that tile Certificate
of Occupancy (CO) could be an illi-
portant legal protection. lrl l974,
the City of Albany instituted the
Certificate of Occupancy for rctlted
property. Tlle law states that every
apartment llnlst be inspected by tile
city brrildirlg dcparttllertt whenever
it becomes vactlrtt. livery landlord is
required to have the certificate and
renew it when changing tenants or
when found ill violation of the
Housing Code. In Albany. accor-
ding lo nlost reports, tile (20. rule
is not enforced. Mishler said it

'should be. "I hold that iftlrcre is no

C.O., the landlord is not entitled to
collect rent." he said. “I don‘t
know the true story on that," he
conceded, [ml 1 do know that
tenants do not have the protection
they should have based on (20.
laws.

Student housing ill Albany is ill
pretty poor condition. according to
Mishler. “Landlords know they earl
get away with not repairing damage
because they know a rlew crop is
coming in." he said. “They charge
higll rcllt because they know they
are dealing with perhaps forrr
separate sources of income instead
of one."

Mishler expressed dissatisfaction
with the anti<grouper law. a city or—
dirlancc which prohibits more than
tlllce unrelated people from living
together. saying. “I don‘t get the
sense that people are being forced
illto anti-grouper situations. The
problem is that they are living under
the grill and when something serious
comes rtp they can‘t complain for
fear of being held in violation of tile
law."

'l‘wcntyvfive years ago. Mishler
explained. there were no laws
governing ltabirabilily standards.
The rules of tltc market place were
supposed to ensure that bollr
landlord arid ll nant were satisfied.
liventually this was seen as all ill-
adequate safcguard. since tenants
were not in all equal bargaining
position.

A l‘)75 law declared that
llabitability guarantees are implied
ill a lease whether explicity stated or
not. It goes on to state that any
residential lease. whether written or
oral. assumes that there will be on
conditions ill tllc premises that
could be detrimental to the life.
safety. or health of tire tenant. if
such it condition exists. according
to the law. and it is rlot caused by
the tenant or those urldcr tlle
tenarlls corltrol. then grounds esisl
for withholding rent. "This rs a
very important prolectioll for
tenants." said Mishler. “I use this
law ltl every ease I go to court
with." .

and housing code violations.
Security deposits are not insurance
against not paying rent. as many
believe. but insurance against
damage. and Mishler said that often
landlords refuse to give them back.

Tile Office of Legal Services dealt
with about 140 cases involving
housing last semester. and about
430 in total. according to Mishler. a
load that lie says is very heavy. To
help process llll. of work.
Mishlcr's office has a staff of 10.
Two secretaries arid eigllt intertts
perform such tasks as interviews
and limited legal research. btll
Mishler emphasized that they give
no advice.

Legal service is available free to
all urulcrgraduales, Mishler said,
amt also to graduate and part-time
students who pay the sttrderlt ac-
tivities fee. "At this point." he
said. “services are free. even if we
go to trial."

Mishler said he does not rcpre~
sent people in crises outside of
Albatty county.

Students should try to do as
rrrlrcll as they call on their own.
Mishler said. "My general
philosophy." he said. “is that
students should learn about their
rights and learn to act on their
