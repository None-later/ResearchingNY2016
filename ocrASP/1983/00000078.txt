Computers‘networking’ their way through US

By Amcy Adams

 

Cornputcrs :trc invading our lives
and the US is turning into it “th-
ivurk Nation." rtccording to Dr.
Abbc anshowill.

ttnd 'I‘cchnoltigy. culls Ihc computcr‘
nctwork a new \vidcsprcnd infra-
structure. “it is I'm more pcrvatsivc
its a social problem. Soon there will
be terminals cvcrywhcrc that will
Iiiik togctltcr Iurgc computcr
systems," he said.

He compared ilic dcvcloprticrtts
ot' the computer age to the In.
duSlt'IiII Rcvulution. Although the
technology is new, suid
Mowshowitx. thc problcrns crcrttcd
by it are not. "It is revolutionary irt
ti sense. but it Is ttlso tl continuation
of what has been happening since
the Industrial Revolution. There is
a clear tic with past dcvciopmciits."

Computch wcrc first introduced

 

in thc l950's. notcd Muwsltuwitz,

trnd were used for what he called
"discrcct ttppliczttion." Among
other things, he suid. cornputcrs
wcrc uscd for accounting in I'uc»
iorics. offices. social service ttgcrt-
cics, schools and hospitals.

However, srtid Mowstmwitz. rntt-

jor technological ttdvttnccs such as
tclc-cornmunicaiions. micro-
processing chips, digital switching,
rtrtd fiber optics. have led to the
evolution of computer networks.
/ All at these developments arc
pushing us, said Mowshowitz,
toward the “Network Nation." He
said he did not think the
phenomenon would change our
social strttciurc significantly. “It
(tlic social structtirc) will changc in
superficial ways." said
Mowshowitz. “Thct‘c is a great deal
of cotttintrity (from the Industrial
Rcvoltttion) ol‘ the wrong kind." he
maintained.

Mowsltowitzwurncd that corn-
putcrs could cvcritiinlly cause severe
problems, such as ttttctnploymcnl
and displacement in the work plrtcc.
We have ttot mum to grips with
thcsc problems." Iic said, but nddcd
tltal.“compulcrs shouldn‘t be
I‘uttltcd for this. We are uddictcd to
looking ut the world itt Icrms ol‘ in-
creased productivity and ct‘ficicncy.
The bottom line is greater computi—
tion in world markets. Social pro-
blems have to be dealt with its well
as incrcascd production.”

Another major problem which
may be caused by coniptttcrs. accor-
ding to MOWSIIOWIII, is It “Total In-
formation Socicty,” which could
lcztd to dcpcndcncc. Moshowitl. its—
cd :1 vttriztnt ol‘ (ircshum's luw
(“dchuscd ctirrcticy drives out good
currency") to cxplnitt thc thrcut.

According to Mowshowitz, cutti-

'rnttnicutiott will drive trttditionrtl

l'tit'tns of communication out.
Tl‘tltlllltllltll forms will liccutnc ob—
stitctc and too cxpcnsivc. For cxttm»
plc. il‘ cvcryonc is ltookcd into the
network and using an automatic
pttymcnt systcrn it would hc
trnl'cnsutrlc l‘or stot'cs to accept
cliccks or cvcn crtslt. This law would
ttlsn apply to thc pt‘iltlcd word, said
Mnushuwitz. It must inl‘tir'mution

"II‘ we ill‘c dcpcndctit tin uitc

Mowshowilr also said that corti-
putcrs' vttst storugc bunks lend in
tlic pr'oblctns of political integrity.
Who should have control ol' the in-
formation rttid who should have ttc-
ccss to that inlormutinn'I, ltc risked.
