Editor’s Aspect

rom forth these deepest nights
F i stand. feet touching upon cold sand.
There is no wind on this angry beach
yet the air wraps around my lungs
and pierces like a sharp spear
in a dark. trembling hand.
There is no vanity here, no contempt.
Showering my ears is the pure. silent
sound of the mid-morning mist
and addressing all the moments of the world
is the promise of a day—
and closer to observe, the huge,
eastward clouds filled a longing,
a forgetfullness of spiritual growth.
There is no person here. no enemy.
And as the warm rain drops down upon
my bare, white shoulders
I remember your promise, your utterance.
The soothing murmur of this ocean. here.
it is a shadow of what you spoke.
Are you in thoughtless sleep?
Is there no memory upon your lips?
I remember when the heaven of every
man surged through your voice
while you clasped my hands as i felt only yours.
The numbness was a paradise then.
Now a shrieking bird flies over my head—
i watch it fly into blue oblivion.
and search the horizon for familiarity.
Yes. now other men are here;
the fishermen and sailors»
but these faces 1 cannot see. I
They breathe death into my fondest dreams.
God, tell me where i am
as i walk no where and keep walking.

Word On A Wing

Poets, painters, and musicians
sometimes choose to live, and
strictly operate, within a very
special world defined by very
special boundaries self-imposed.
When we read, inspect, or listen
to their work we enter into their
domain far more than they do in-
