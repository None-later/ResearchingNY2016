meone want to hear them? I asked myself
these confounding questions. and it turned
out that most people wouldnor care to hear
from the former. while the latter more than
justifies our exploration. Panter Burns has
released a 4 song LP named Blow Your
Top.whlle the Tygers of Pan Tang has
given us an LP titled The Cage. The two
are contrasts In ingenuity and style.

Robert Schneider

Panther Burns Is an energetic. unbridled
band whose name has an unusual story
behind It. It seems that long ago. a small
Mississippi town was afflicted by a runaway
pet panther. one that liked to munch on
kids and cattle. After the schools thinned
out and the price of meat skyrocketed. the
locals decided to go after the beast. They
cornered him in some bushes. and set
those bushes ablaze. The screams of the
naturally agitated klttykat could be heard
for miles, so the town was affectionately
renamed “Panther Burns".
Blow Your‘Top is the second release
from the band. the first being Behind the
Magnolia Curtain. a hill-fledng LP
i(r‘rt'iitaristvvocalist 'l'av Falco grew up in
Arkansas. and was hence influenced by the
legendary blues great Jimmy Withersp‘oon
Blow Your Top doesn't have very much to
do with the blues. except in the listener's
case. .
It's extremely difficult to describe this
group's sound without using comparisons.
For example. vocalist Falco sounds like a
cross between Buddy Holly and George
Thorogood. Sounds Interesting. doesn't it?
It Isn't. Instead of sticking with one impres-
sion per record. Falco tries to sound like
everybody and winds up sounding like
nobody. In only one place does his
mimicking work. "Bertha Lou" has him

! mount Pictures new release that
traces Cadet Will McLean's rite of
passage to manhood within the hallowed
halls of the Carolina Military Institute. The
film is based on Pat Conroy's book of the
same title. a somewhat autobiographical
account of the author's own early years at
the Southern Military Institute. At the heart
of this film is a uniquely southern
phenomenon: the ‘secret society'.

Megan Gray Taylor

 

Within the walls of this training ground of
'men' there Is a secret group of cadets
known as The Ten who are at the heart of
the drama. It Is their job to make sure no
‘undesirable elements' make it through the
first few days of the academy. Cadet
McLean Is called on to protect an
‘undesirable' and throws himself and his
roommates into conflict with the system
and each other.

Cadet McLean is played brilliantly by
David Keith (Richard Gere's Oklahoma
friend from An OI/icer and a Gentlemen).

the traditions or to tear them dowu is

actor. ‘

(his ‘Iambs') is veteran actor Robert Prosky.
Prosky is eloquent as the tough exterior.
soft-hearted man who truly embodies all
the ‘oId—boy' ideals and justly warrants the
faith and love of the cadets. Prosky plays it
with just enough restraint so that the
character survives an otherwise sappy post
lion in this movie.

The cast of young cadets that forrr
McLean's allies and enemies are for the
most part, unknown actors. Most notable

hard style. It would be untrue and unjust to
call the Tygers of Pan Tang a Heavy Metal
band. that would lump them In with
classics like Judas Priest. Ozzy. AC/DC.
and a galaxy of other "stars". True. there
are occasional screaming vocals and
guitars. along with booming drums. but
there's also innovation and ingenuity that
you don't often find on most Heavy Metal
albums.

When you listen to The Cage. you get
the feeling tha this group has been influenc—
ed by many. but hasn't become obsessed
with any. For example. "Paris By Air"
sounds like Styx. Before you write off these
guys. consider that this sounds more like
"Renegade" or "Miss America". rather
than sappy stuff like "Babe". It's got a
mean little backbeat that endears it to a
listener immediately. Brian Dick and some

authoritarianism and an excess of
vlolence...l'm not just making a film about
a military college but a film that will also
present my view of the United States."

It is difficult enough for many Americans
to understand the ‘Southern Mystique'.
and certainly the pitfalls of Gone Willi The
Wind imagery run rampant In this film. Old
Charleston Is a superficial representation of
the Ante-bellum south where a “nigger
could only come in the front gate If he was
here to cut the grass". This is so clearly an
outsiders prejudice ladden view of the
south that I found myself dlsliking this film
inspite of Its qualities.

 

 

guy named “Rocky”. on drums and bass
respectively. provide a steady anchor for
most of the songs on The Cage. Peter Col~
llns. the producer. should have given these
two more room to play. because when they
get It. watch out. “Making Tracks".
perhaps the most heavy metal song on the
album. has the strongest bass and drums
on the record. You get a sense of Cheap
Trick on that one. especially in Robb Weir's
slashing guitar chords. Lead vocalist .lon
Deverll does his best to sound like Robin
Zander. and It really works when Weir's
guitar Is at it's best.

Many of the songs on this record are
written by the band, Keyboardlst Fred
Pruser plays a big part In the writing depart-
ment. on this album at least. The most
notable cover Is the classic “Love Potion
No. 9". Unfortunately. it's a poor version
of a great song. being sped up to the point
of hysteria. Perhaps if It wasn't so damn
hyperactive it would make a go of It.

Soon after the above debacle. Robb
Weir delights a.|lslener with. of all things. a
talkbox on “Letter From LA." A talkbox Is
a strange little contraption that most closely
resembles someone talking through a
kazoo. Peter Frampton got alot of mileage
out of talkboxes during his heyday. It's a
wonder why it wasn't used more on this
record. In a change of pace. The Cage
closes with a slow ballad called “The
Actor". Fred Purser plays a nice piano
here. and it's curious why it too didn't play
a bigger role on the record. However. Its
lack of utilization doesn't detract from the
overall effect.

Both Panther Burns and the Tygers of
Pan Tang have chosen weird names. Why
did they do this? Could it be to attract at-
tention to themselves? It seems that Pan-
ther Burns. with Blow Your Top. only at-
tracted attention to threadbare. weary
compositions. On the other hand. the
Tygers of Pan Tang chose to put their best
feet forward with novel. exciting music. Aw
hell. lalways liked tigers better. anyway. (LI

The film was shot on location at San—
dhurst. the only military college in
England. and the setting is great. There is a
real sense of being in a military academy
rich with history and tradition. Brian
Trufano's photography is effect and the
English weather (somewhat gloomy for
those morning troop reviews) was perfect.
John Mollo is the brains behind the
costumes (he lists to his credits such films as
Star Wars. Allen, Barry Lyndon and
Ghandi) and the extensive collection of
earlies 60's dresses for the prom scene are
great.

Roddam could have made a really good
film here. and in some ways did in spite of
himself. Roddam. a current devotee of the
Francis Ford Coppola school of socially
relevant films has not succeeded in his at-
tempts here. He has however, made an
entertaining film full to the brim with really
impressive acting. '

If violence does not put you off. because
there Is a considerable amount of ‘cringe in
your seat' violence. or you are fascinated
by the workings of the 'secret society' brand
of terror. you will like this film a bit more
than I did. It is worth seeing, if for no other
reason for the fine performances of Keith
and Prosky.
