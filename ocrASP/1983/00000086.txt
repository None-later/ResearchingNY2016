Leasing an apartment

<5

nttd should know titut an oral lease
for grcatcr than n ycur cannot be
enforced.

The most common type of lease is
thc wriltcn [case which cstnblishcs
tltc tcrms of tcnnncy. Once signed.
neither the landlord nor the tcnnnt
may ultcr any of the terms without
the complete consent of the other.
These agreements usually extend
for one year. The pamphlet advises
that a tenant read the lease carefully
before signing. and if unhappy with
the terms (most lcuses favor the
landlord). discuss it with the
landlord and seek advice. For
SUNYA students, the chal Ser-
vices Office. the Off-Campus
Housing Office and the Off-
Cumpus Association are available
for advice.

According to the pamphlet. when
reading over a lease. a prospective
tcnant should look for certain pro-
visions. Thc lcasc should specify the
amount of rent and when it is due.
It should spell out tltc respon-
sibilities of both tenant and
landlord. It should also specify the
length of the agreement and exactly
what is bcittg rented. including use
of laundry. backyard, storage
space. ctc. Othcr important things
to look for include:

> Who pays what utilities? Docs
the lease protect you from a change
from landlord paying utilitics to te-
nant paying utilities?

> Is there a clause allowing the
landlord to raise the rent if taxes or
heating costs go up?

> What kinds of alterations are
you allowed to make? What kinds
of repairs are you required to
make?

In a Tenants Rights handbook
published by the New York At-
torney Gcncrul’s Office. laws arc
cited which require [cases to use
words with common and cvcryduy

meanings and be clcttr and
coherent.
Also in tile Tcuunts Rights

bookch is a rcmiudcr thnt the lttw
does not require that any particular
[case be uscd. Most landlords usc
forms that dcmund u tukc-it-or-
lcuvc-it basis. it gocs on to say that
courts may rcfusc to cttforcc on

clause. Because of the possibility of
trapping the tcnunt. landlords must
give at least 15 days notice of this
clause before the tenant is required
to renew.

Generally. a sublcusc occurs
witctt thc tcnunt rents the apartment
or house to another person during
the time covered by the lease.
Distinct from the sublcasc is tltc
assignment. The diffcrcncc is thnt
an assignment is when the new to-
nnnt assumes the entire remaining
time on the Icasc and on thc some
terms as the original tcnant. A

sublcase occurs when the new tc-
nant is not rcnting the entire titnc
left on the original lease. and is not
subject to the same terms.

The most important disticntion
between the two is that in a
sublcasc. the original tenant may be
liable for the rent and damages.
while in an assignment. the original
tenant is generally not liable. In a
building containing four or more
rcsidcntial units. Ihc landlord may
not unreasonably withhold his con-
sent to sublet. If you do not live in a
dwelling having four or more
residential units. the booklet nd-
ViSCS, you should read the lcttsc
carefully to establish provisions for
subletting.

More information on leases and
off-campus housing is available at
the Legal Services Office in CC

Regent Brown prescribes new directions 4‘

for upgrading public education systems

 

By Jackie Mackey

chcnt Sltirlcy C. Brown took her Patroou Room
nudicncc Saturday "Inside the Board of chcnts" to
urgc that public cductttion aimed at a global pcrspcc-
live is "somcthing we have to do and as quickly as
possible."

Brown. nu ussociutc profcssor of psychology at
Albany outlined the major issucs of long-term impor-
tuncc l‘ttcing education today and said the Board of
Regents is “attempting to rc-cvuluntc ihc cducntionul
goals of ottr public schools."

 

Changes in thc conccpts of technology and “work”
have ncccssittttcd tltc rc-cxuminntion of the mic of
public schools. primarily clcmcntary and sccondury
cdttcution said Brown. Currently the Board is working
on an extensive position pnpcr in an effort to undch-
tnnd what the public fccls should bc emphasized in
Ncw York schools. and ltow succcssl'ul public cductt-
tion is in rcaching its gouls. snid lirown. The paper will
bc discusscd and cvultttttcd by scvcrttl groups und in-
stituttous.

Internship is a capital experience

 

By Jane Anderson

 

An intcruship with the Washington Ccntcr ltus im-
measurable valuc in getting a job. said the Excculivc
Director of the organization, James Hcl'fcron. at n lcc-
turc in LC l3 on Monday. Students wcrc informed of
various internship opportunities with thc ccntcr. which
has been affiliated with SUNYA this year.

The Washington Center was established in 1975 to
provide learning opportunities that extend bcyoud the
classroom into "the real world" of business. govern-
ment. and other agencies and it placcs students with
organizations in the Washington D.C. area for one
semester. according to its newsletter.

Onc former intcrn said that the program is valuable
because “you learn to identify with what it is to bc a
true professional." He holds that “experimental learn-
ing programs can offer college students the opportuni-
ty to broaden their outlook and experience." and they
consider the academic internship program to be in-
strumental in achieving this goal.

In tltc past several years. approximately five
SUNYA students have participated in the program in-
dependent of the university. “These students found
the experience to be worthwhile." according to Robert
Gibson. Assistant Dean of CUE and thc Liaison Of-
ﬁcer bctwccn SUNYA and the Washington Center,
"so we dccidcd to become formally nffiliulcd this
year."

WC sponsors intcrnships “for just about any major,
cxcluding industrial cnginccring." said llcl't‘cron. "In
the past. we have had students interning ttt thc J. l".
Kcnncdy Ccntcr for Performing Arts. busincss mujors
hnvc intcrucd ill Amtruck. and communications mn-
jors at corporations such as tltc Cubic Ncws Network.
It is no longcr just limitcd to Congress and Ihc govcrn-
tncnt."

According to Hcl‘l'cron. WC bus in its file scvcrul

thottsnud ugcncica ttnd cotupnnics lltttt tukc inlcrus.
During tltc application process. it vcry dctnilcd tinti-
citing scttttcncc tukcs plttcc bctwccu thc prttspcctivc in-
tcrtt. WC. and thc prospcctivc placc of intcrnship.

In addition to thc rcgulur tuition for SUNYA. l'ccs
listcd for lhc fall scmcstcr WC program total $l.575.
This incluch apartment-style housing. which is op-
tiounl. and thc cnlirc program of seminars. pluccmcnt.
und olltcr spccinl cvcnis. Somc interns arc pnid small
stipends. but in gcncrttl. intcrns should not cxpcct to
bc paid for thc work they put in.

Most scholarships and loans can be continucd
throughout the internship. however. according to WC.
somc studcnts will still be cligiblc to rcccivc work-study
funds. and thcrc arc u vcry fcw scholarships available
through WC.

Titc work the interns do varies from position to posi-
tion. but no more limit 25 percent clerical work is
allowed at any time. Gibson described tltc work as
"vcry clearly bcyoud tltc clerical" and wcnt on to say
that in thc pttst SUNYA students have worked as
govcrnmcnt nich. t'cscurchcrs. and other rcsponsiblc
positions.

Onc fortncr SUNYA student said hc was regarded to
he “just its important its a paid cmploycc" witctt he
worked in the Washington D.C. Corporation Council.
“The initiatch of thc student is very important in gain-
ing responsibility." stutcd Gibson.

The studcnls work for four nttd it half days in their
nssigncd ngcncics. and thc otltcr Itnll' tiny is spent itt tltc
rcquircd ucudcmic sctuinur. Thc sctuinnrs nrc corn-
pcrttblc to n thrcc-crcdit class. nnd the students ztrc
usually rcquircd to write pnpcrs. but “Ihc cmphnsis on
