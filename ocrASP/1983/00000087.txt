may require a higher GPA and Gib-
son said, that “most students find
tlte second semester of their senior
year the best time" to go. “it is not
necessary to be a major or minor in
arty speclfle department."

Once prospective interns have
decided to begin application pro-
cedures, they must find a faculty
sponsor who will supervise the pro-
grant from the SUNYA campus attd
determine the nature of the reports
attd assignments to be turned in at
tlte ettd of the internship. 't‘hen tlte
student must gain Approval t'rom
Dean Gibson, the Liaisott Officer,
and fill out the application form
from WC. "We place almost every
applicant." said Hefferon. “The
screening of applicants usually
takes place on the ltotne campus."
ltc said.

No specific prerequisite courses
are required for the programs, bttt
background work is considered
when finding placement. according
to (iibsou.

Dean Gibson said that, although
“the ttutuber ol' interns has been
litnited on this campus,“ experience
has shown that having been an in-
tent “helps a great deal to get a job
after graduation." lie especially
reeottttnettded the program to
liberal arts majors as "an excellent
opportunity." and said that "this
eottld get a graduate a job that a
plain liberal arts degree wouldn't
have." He went on to say that after
graduation. “many interns end up
going back to the companies they
ittterttcd with.“

The valttc oi" tltc internship when
applying to graduate school is quesv
tiottable. however, because they
place tnore emphasis on grades and
test scores. littt. “its valttc itt gelling
jobs is immeasurable." said lief-
l'ct'ott. “Washington needs help and
the interns do get a great deal of
pt'ol‘esssional activity." A former
intern described tltc program as “a
phenotnlnal experience," and tithi-
ed that he received experience there

t'attgements were indeed being made
to want students of the possibility
that bus service below Draper llall
may be halted in the future. He said
the proposal does not necessarin
tnean tltc university will stop the
service, bttt may charge fares.
"That's certainly something that
will be discussed." ltc said.
“Students shottld notify me formal-
ly of wltat they prefer be done. That
would be very helpful."

“At this point." ltc said. “ we are
only trying to ittsurc that students
don’t make plans f0r residence at
the “0th Wellington or anywhere
below Draper Hall in the future
witlt tltc expectation that bus service
will be provided for them."

He said alternative university
transportation was a possibility. but
speculated no further.

According to Hartigatt. the bits
operation at SUNYA is a high-
volume type system that gives rides
to over two million students a year.
The vstcm consists of is buses,
and two routes: the Wellington, and
the Alumni which runs front the up-
town campus to Draper and back.
The Wellington buses leave up-
town's traffic circle approximately
every 20—30 minutes, while the
Alumni leave every 5-15.

Final decisions on the bus
SYstem's fate will have to wait until
the ’83-'84 NY. State budget is
passed by the State Legislature, ac-
cording to Haritgan's office.
