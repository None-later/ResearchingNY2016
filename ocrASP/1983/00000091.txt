Central Council. including eight
newly elected members. voted
Wednesday night to override SA
President Mike Corso‘s veto of a
resolution that opposed a con-
troversial cartoon in the Feb.2 issue
of the Student Voice.

Only a simple majority is needed
to override a presidential veto,
however; Council voted 16-10-2
against Corso's feeling that it is not
Council's place to decide what ap-
pears on the cover or SA's bl-
wcekly publication.

The cartoon. which Post said she
acquired from a publication by the
Centrrtl Committee for Conscien-
tious ()bjeclors, depicts a man
entering a post office to register for
anything."

He explained that he vetoed the
the (l‘ t. car the doorwrry ar'
anti-military signs, including one
proclaiming “The Marines are
looking for a few dead men." Ae-
eorrrpauying the cartoon was an at—
ticlc on the Solomon arrrcndnrertt.
wlticlt derties financial aid to rttale
students not registered for tire
draft.

“we are tlte only state rrrtiversity

added that “we use abottt 2,500 lbs.
of top round beet“ for on meal."
The ntachittcry used is irt good con-
dition and very clean.

tttrte added that “more or less
everything is tirade from scrat-
elt—-—no preservatives."

Clortglt explained the reason the
cake gets hard is due to the fact that
no preservatives trre rtdded and “the
rninttle the air hits it. it starts get-
tirtg hard." [ ]

This is the first piece of legisla-
tion that Corso has vetoed and he
said he isn't angry about his veto
being overriden. but he thinks "it's
ridiculous." and “doesn't mean
resolution because he didn't believe
it was the right way to handle the
problem. and that members should
have spoken to him or Student
Voice Editor Libby Post if they had
a complaint. “i think Central
Council ntade fools of themselves
once again. They handled this irref-
ficiently. ineffectively. and counter-
productively." Corso commented.

Vice Chair Cathy LaSusa \oted
against the original rcsoltrtion. but
voted itr favor of overriding the
veto. “i don't think the president
should have the power to veto a serr-
titncnt of Council." site said.

The original resolution. and the
vote to override the veto. she said.
were two separate issues. She ex-
plained that site did not support the
resolution brrt "Central Council as
a whole agreed with its content."

Alumni Quad representative Rich
Schal‘l'er argued that tltc resolution
and the \otc to override the veto on
it were a waste of Council‘s time.
when they could be working on
tnorc itrrportattt issues. “W‘ are
making our ' 'cs look very bttd to

 

 

the campus. We‘re spending $9.000
on the Student Voice and what
we’re doing is ripping It apart. The
students aren't even going to
respect it." he said.

Post said this controversy is un-
necessary and if Council members
are dissatisfied with the Voice she
‘htts always encouraged tltern to pro-
vide input.

Post told Council that she ltad
not expected the veto to be voted on
because of an agreement she had-
madc with Council Chair Jeff
Fromm and representatives Lisa
Kerr and Eric Sauter. The agree-
rrrent. she explained. was that she
would print an article they would
write opposing the cartoon in a
future isstre of the Voice. if they
would drop the matter. She corr-
tends that when she and Fromm
"shook hands" on lltis deal it was
her understanding that he had the
ItcL‘essttty support for it.

l-‘romttt maintained that the
agreement that lie. Kerr. ttttd
Hauler made was that if l’ost would
let tlterrr write an article for the
Voice opposing the cartoon. tltett
hc. Kerr, and Hunter uould rrot
rtrovc to override the veto. liromrn
said he made it very clear to Post
that ltc was not speaking for all of

Council.

Off-campus representative Eleen
Steinield made the motion to over-
ride the veto.

However, Fromm did vote in
favor of the override. He said he
did this because Corso vetoed the
resoltrtiorr for the wrong reasons.
Fromm accused Corso of vetoing
the resolution for "personal
reasons“ or beeatrse of a "game he
wanted to play.” to see ltow l'ar
Council would take this.

He added that he supported the

"Council overrides pro-cartoon resolution veto

original resolution because
although the Student Voice is sup-
posed to advocate student issues. it
is “only to advocate what SA as a
body decides to advocate."

in addition to the four off-
campus representatives elected last
Week. State Quad representative
Steve Gawley. Dutch Quad rep.
Mark Grleb. and Indian Quad reps.
Janice Haymes and Tyrone Mon-
tague were elected Wednesday.
Montague was elected as a write-in
cartdidate. 1']

journalistic and do not have ‘the
rtrbric of scholarship. It is
bltttantly clear that Zwana fits into
ottr faculty." Pogue said.

Stressng that the students want
Zwana as a teacher. “that lte is
worth the input." White said. "the
students pay rrrortey to learn. they
should have a say in what pro-
fessors get chosen." "Ont trrain
argument is that you do ttot have to
publish books to be a good pro-
fessor. a lot of professors spend
time writing books trttd are not
good ill the classroom.“ White em—
plittsile‘ti.

White said that A.S.U.B.A. has
been circulating a petition. in the
dorms last week and in the Campus
Center this Week. eritc added that
he hopes to get one thousand
signatures on the petition. and arm-
ed with faculty signatures and ad-
ministrative recommendations
A.S.U.li./\. hopes to have a
meeting with the Dean. the Vice-
l’resident attd I’t'csidcttl of the
University sometime in March.

l’ogue sttid that an effort is being
tirade to keep Zwana irt some
capacity with relationship to the
faculty after August. htrt declined
to mention any specifies. i l
