Pro-Israeli group founded

By Fran Schneir

Last weekend SUNYA was the site for
the founding conference of Tagar, a new
nationwide, pro-Israeli political organiza-
tion. The meeting, which culminated with a
speech by New York Assemblyman Dov
Hiekind and a telegram to Mcnachem Begin
to inform him of Tngar's formation. was
convened primarily to set fortlt Tagar's
aints and to encourage the student par-
ticipants to form chapters ofTagar at their
own colleges.

According to Steve Hilenrath of
SUNYA's Revisionist Zionist Alternative
(RZA), which sponsored the conference,
Tagar is affiliated with Herut USA, the
American counterpart of Menachctn
Ilcgin's Herut Party in Israel. "Tagar grew
as a response to inadequacies of the student
response to anti-Israeli, anti-scmetic pro-
paganda," l-Iilsenrath said, as well as to
make Jewish students across the country
tnore aware of their heritage anti more sup-
portive of Israel.

RZA and Tagar cotne together,
Hilsenratlt said, by following tlte free enter-
prise Zionist principles of Leev .labostinsky
as opposed to the “mainstream” socialist
Zionist movement embraced by the Israeli
labor Patty.

Tttgar's precepts ittclttde suppt..t of tire
Israeli goverttntent, belief in the inalienable
right of the Jewish people to the ltllltl of
isrttcl witltin its historic boundaries, presel-
vntion of Jewish idctttity and fostering of
Jewish vttltrcs, encouragement of good US-
isrucli I’L‘lillltnls, advocacy of ttliyah (Jewish
cmmigrtttion to Israel), study of the Hebrew
lttngtntgc and personal involvement with
Israel.

An enthusiastic grottp of appt‘ovittntlcly
too college students from around the coun-
try participated ill the two days of
workshops, meetings, and speeches, pro-
viding a responsive audience for
/\\\t'ilil1l)’llitlll Dov Hiekind as he spoke
fervently about his committment to Israel
anti Tagar.

"There’s nothing In this world that i love

more...than the state of Israel," Hiekind
"asserted.

Cautionlng against making concessions
Hiekind warned, "You don‘t give up youl
home; you don't give up what belongs to
you because if you do it today, tomorrow
they'll ask you for a piece ofTei Aviv in the
name of peace."

Hiekind chastizcd Jews for being “too
quiet“ and not working hard enough for
Israel.

"The media has done a hatchet job on
Israel," Hcikind told the crowd. adding

Some of the students who attended thr-
confercnce were also concerttcd ttltuut
media “propaganda” and were even more
emphatic titan Hiekind itt their view that
Israel deserved total support.

Alex Kozin, originally frotn ()dcsstt
USSR but now studying irt Los Angcicx, at:
firmed. “If you keep quiet, notitiug will
happen. Evert if the news lllt'tlltl
misrepresents you, if people hear you speak
and see your pampltlcts it will make it do!
fercttce. There is nothing Ill this country. or
III Russia, or in Europe, for Jews. You lime

the conditions of being it .Icw.

Like ttttttty of the students ptttllt‘tpzttlltu

A "Lion dance," a martial arts
demonstration, and various musical perfor-
mances were the highlights of the Chinese
New Year Celebration Saturday. The

SUNYA‘s Chinese Student Association.

The "New Year" began at 5:30 p.m. with

ed cafeteria style by metnbers of CSA amid
an elaborately decorated dittittg room fed
approximately 200-230, according to Clnt
Loh, a vice president.

"We made three of the dishes." Loh
said, “and Szechuan Hall, 11 local Chinese
Restaurant, catered the other four dishes."

Loh said that he was lutppy with the large
tttrnout for the ditrner. The guests also
sccmcd to be quite pleased with the meal.
“I came ottce before," said Paul Hooker. tt

before." When asked his reasons for atten-
ding tltc dinner, llookcr revealed. “l was

Mclintt (‘tttsotrnototn a Cypriot student

food, ttttd because I would want others to
cotttc if we held an inicrmttional ditmcr.

Following tltc ditttter, a variety show at

The show began with a liott dance, “tradi-
tionally performed at the beginning of eaclt
New Year to scare away cvil attd to bring
forth good luck," said co-mastcr of
ceremonies and a vice-president I-Iarry Hui.

The dance consisted of a group of
dancers covered with a brightly decorated
blue, pink, yellow, red “dragon"likc

The lion dance was followed by a
welcoming address to the audience by Presi-

originated in the western providence of
China and is "very popular in China
today," according to co-emece Linda Jung.

One of the most spectacular perfor-
mances of the night was a martial arts
demonstration by H.Ci. Kin and Joint

by Chang, was one depicting the “union of
tiger and crane,“ according to Hal, which
"helps develop breathing patterns as well as
strengthen the fingers, arms and tendons."

The second set was perforated by Kin,
who demonstrated one of the ﬁrst martial
arts forms. This form incorporated the use
of strikes, blocks, and punches. It was
originally used to attack and defeat a tiger
in what is called art "I formation."

The third and final martial arts forttt was

quick and explosive movements, and was
designed to increase flexibility. endurance
and speed. "The movements were designed

Attending a SUNY school doesn't mean
a student is locked up inside New York
State for four years.

Approximately 100 study abroad pro-
grams in over 30 countries are offered to
SUNY students, according to Albany
Director of the Office of international Pro-
grams Alcx M. Shane.

The primary task of the ()IP, located in
the same office as CUE (ULB36), is to ad-
vise students of programs sponsored by
Albany and other SUNY institutions.

Assistant to the Director I'lannclorc
Pussontto explained that the department of-
fers a wide range of litcratttre on foreign
programs within SUNY and through other
sources. “Students look through tltc infor-
mation, see what's available, and," she
said, “we try to see what‘s best for them."

Shane said that during the 1982-83 year,
"it total of about iSh students per semester
(\vcnl) overseas, l"t)I’ every position
available, I’ussttnno added, two students

will apply, equalling a 2:1 ratio.

"The biggest drawing cardsh" according
to Passanno, are Madrid, Copenhagen, and
Wurrbttrg. In these programs. approx-
imately 30 students attend for one year.

The length of the program depends on
the time the office has to prepare for the
departure, said Shane. He added that
“screening” candidates for tire fall occurs
between Marclt I5 and April l. For Spring
semester, the application deadline is mid
October.

According to Shane, approximately 40
percent of the selected students study
abroad for a year. However, Shane added
that the duration of some programs is for
only one semester.

A prospective candidate must evaluate
many factors before selecting a program,
emphasized I’asstmno. The student must
view such considerations as career goals,
academic programs, language requirements
and future aims.

The program is opctt to any student;
however, before being accepted, Itc/sltc
must go through an application process.

Shane explained that a prospective can-
didate must file a written application, ob-
tain letters of recommendation, provide a
transcript, a statement of purpose and
goals, and participate in a 20-30 minute in-
terview with professors from departments
relevant to the trip as well as members of
the programs office.

According to Passanno. ltcr office seeks
candidates who display “maturity, pur-
pose, academic achievement and overall
academic goals."

Shane maintained that “going abroad rc-
quircs flexibility." He explained when
students are abroad, they are placed in a
different academic and cultural at-
mosphere, usually demanding that they ud-
jttst and to some extent change their mode
of thinking.

Asked about the expense of studying
abroad, l’assttnno estimated the cost as be-
ing approximately equitttlcnt to that at
Albany. The price for tttition of ti SUNY
pingl'illll, (III-CHI“le I‘tlUlIl, DUI'SOIHII CV-
pcnscs, and lligltt expenses would be
“$5,()0tl-$5,5tl0 for l()-|| months“ abroad.

Passanno maintained the cost is relatively
reasonable when one compares the price of
going abroad with an “eight month on-
campus year at Albany for $4,400."

Shane added that the student also has the
opportunity to tour Eumpe through
variotts inexpensive programs.

When a student studies abroad through a
SUNY program, according to Passanno.
the person is still considered an Albany stu-
dent. “They slay registered in Albany. attd

Shane cautioned that concerning credits.
tltc programs are certified, and accredited,
bttt the application of credits to the
student's program rests on the department.
