Trustees adopt budget plan

as a result of the proposals of staff
redtiction and a need to cut costs.
added Wharton.

SUC—Cortland has already
outlined .aretts to be cut and
eliminated according to Cortland
Universin Senate President
Willititti Rogers. “A cut iii seven
otit of ten of the tnusic courses will
eliminate a tntisic major program at
Cortland," he said. “Also the
foreign language major has been
eliminated because of lack of de-
mund." He went on to explain that
it is unfortunate bill it was decided
to cut the hockey program along
with girls' softball and reduce the
football program.

I’lrittshurgh President Joseph
litirkc explained. "it's the small
programs that cost a lot tlittt are be-
ing cut." A music major was
eliminated. all physical education
requirements were dropped. cutting
sortie courses. and a heavy ctit iii the
teachers’ education program lirivc
all been planned for I’lattsburg.
said Iliirke. "Programs like music
will he cut more because of the re-
quirement for iiitich itidividiiul iii-
sllllclil)” that is expensive." he
said.

on the issue ot'closing some crim-
prises Wharton said. “the governor

did not agree with the concept of
“downsizing” the SUNY system
and it would be premature to con-
sider the closing of campuses." The
university did seriously consider
closing one or rtiore campuses. said
Wharton, or effecting sortie
mergers to resolve the fiscal crisis.
However. they hope that the pro-
blem would be temporary. the
tremendous amount of time rc-
quircd for such drastic change that
closings would entail and the lack
of immediate savings rttlcd out the
alternative for the time being.
Wharton said.

But, he added. “it would he dif-
ficult to achic\e an outcome with
both fiscal and academic integrity
witliotit major reductions iii pro-
grams or climinations or without
rcditctioii itt tltc size and the diversi-
ty of the university system."

In reaction to the decisions by the
board SASU President Jim Tierney
voiced his disapproval of faculty
cuts to tire university. saying. "it
seems that we may never get the
good faculty back or it will be dif-
limit. but stall" can be rchircd casi-
Iv."

’l'ict'ticy proposed that increased
attention should be given to the
work-study program as it solution
to saving tiioiicy. helping students

and increasing the needed services,
such as library hours, for the
students.

“This idea for a work-study in-
crease has merit and will be con-
sidered." said Wharton.

Albany President Vincent
O'Leary replied to Ticrney’s state-
ment of faculty cuts at SUNYA by
saying, “we considered cutting ad-
ministration and staff before we
started on faculty." When later
asked about specitic plans to cut
programs and staff at SUNYA
O‘Lcary would forward no infor-
mation but said “a budget panel
has been working on the situation
but we will take no action or give
out information until the budget
returns from the legislature on
March 3] ."

The $59.| million proposed
budget increase over last year would
be almost totally absorbed by salary
increases negotiated last year by the
state and employee unions.
Clirtrtdlcr commented that “The
hortrd should let the unions know
Iliat increases in salaries may be
bad.

"State employees deserve the
salary increases." said SASU Vice
President Scott chlcr. "They
have already agreed to give up two
weeks salary and sortie health
hciiel' .." The unions negotiated
the increases in good faith. he add-
