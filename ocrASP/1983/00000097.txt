On the road with the guys

Which Is

once had an argument with a
I friend of mine who iirmly believes

that the world we live In is getting
out oi hand. "Progress." he said. “Is
becoming Insanity." What convinced him
was an episode oi "That's Incredible."
“When a guy trying to Jump over a
speeding car misses and becomes a fruit
salad on prime titne T.V. in iront of
mtllions—-l've seen enough. The world will
end as soon as God crashes down hard on
our hedonistic society." I told him that he
couldn't handle an advanced high-tech
World and to get his head out oi the sand.

Well. nobody ever said that I couldn't be
swayed

Bourbon Street iti downtown New
Orleans is a human trailic jam irom dusk till
dawn during the two weeks of Mardi Gras.
It Is not as crowded as N.Y. City's Italian
iestlval. because there is tnore rootn to
wander on Bourbon St. but It is twenty
times as saturated with alcohol. As you
stagger down the ornate corridor you
notice a repetition oi establishmerits--iood
Joints. souvenir shops. bars. sex shows.
massage parlors. and more bars. The Only
change occurs as you walk further down:
you see a greater number oi strippers and
massage parlors (whiclt give massages on-
ly...so i hear). And it you venture even lur-
Iher all that you've seen disappears and is
replaced by gay bars. it's a lively part oi
town.

Every two or three blocks you run across
temporary lodgings or hotels. Many have
ornate irerich decor and are very beautilul.
and all are very expensive (especially dur-
ing Mardi Gras). These hotels have two or
three tiers oi balconies lined with people
drinking. laughing. and singing. Below on
the street are huge crowds drinking,
laughing. and singing. The people on the
balconies are looking down at the people
oti the street. who are looking up at the
people oti the balconies partying arid look-
ing down. And everyone is sort oi looking
at each other. "So this is Mardi Gras." I
thought (disappointingly).

“Show your tits. Show your tits." ltun»
dreds below began to demand. "Show
your tits."tlie crowd continued. I quickly
and astuter concluded that this was sortie
sort oi club. as they all had their “Show
Your Tits" buttons adorning their body. I
walked away thinking this a silly, un-
productive iorm oi rnerriment. Surely
nobody. no woman I mean. would res-
pondEspecially considering the obviously
well-to-do clientelle oi this hotel (which
was impregnable because oi armed security
guards). As I departed the crowd cheered.
but I ignored It as more desperate pleas.

“One more time. one more time." was
the Jubilant cry. I listened with shocked.
disbelieving ears waiting for it again. “ONE
MORE TIME." they screamed. I turned
and ventured. back to the promised land.

As l looked, everyone's attention seem-
ed to be on a girl. located in the middle oi
the top balcony. She had soft blond hair. a
cute turned up nose. Innocent blue eyes
and looked respectable enough to dispell
any iears. “Probably a legal secretary from
Nashville who was really glad to get away
from the daily grind." I thought. "just
creating false excitement." Actually. she
did look vaguely familiar.

“ONE MORE TIME. ONE MORE
TIME." The girl took the barrette out of her

can stand the pressure. She looks as It she’s
weakening. “No. don't do It! Don't give In!
You've got more to live for! Think oi you

From the depths of the gutter where the
crowd tossed me. I saw the inevitable. She
showed them. Just lifted her shirt and
showed her them-both oi them. I mean
they were nice. but they were her tits!
Where's the sanctity? Where's the world
going to?

Two nights later. RT and l were talking
politics on Bourbon Street when two
feminists began to raise sortie rabble. They
were calling out to see Ii any brave men
were around: "Show your nuts" was the
call. Aiter seeing a good thirty or iorty tits
we were Mardi Gras veterans and glad to
oblige. We Jumped In irotit oi them. rolled
our eyes on top oi our head and ranted
and roared while head butting each other.
Unamused they walked away.

can't go to the Super Bowl." i said it slowly

gone over the edge. He assured me he was

alone from other holidays arid/or relebrm

The same procession tnarches through
Bourbon Street during the evening hours.
At peak partying time thousands of people
get all the street without a word oi harrass-
ment or complaint. Basically it's get all the
street or die.

This organization transcends Into the
realm oi safety. Police are all over Bourbon
St. Yet the most common oiiense during
Mardi Gras is public display oi the body

the tiature oi the crowds or the police
presence matters not. ior peace reigns.

Unlike Halloween arid New Year's Eve.

celebration is seemingly danger tree. This is

the amount oi violence and injury was
pleasingly low

drinking. dancing. singing. smoking.

all other costume~orlented occasions. the
Mardi Gras attire has no norm. With

This all climaxes on Mardi Gras Dayv-l-at
Tuesday-Shrove Tuesday. On this day
New Orleans comes to a hilt. Nobody
works and everybody watches; the parade
and eachother. On this day the costumes
come out and so do the colors. the entire
city Is liivolved.

our departure. We had the lack of brain
power to think that we could leave at

downtown? Black people. It took us two
hours to go the final quarter mile. I've
always had an aiiinity for the negro race so
I enjoyed this. The parade was gone but
thousands lingered. Most were either
drinking or dancing (or Calling us honkles).
Without sounding like a bleeding-heart
liberal. l though this was a cool way to
