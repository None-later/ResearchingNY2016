Trustees adopt financial plan

in an effort to have some control
and a last word regarding program
and faculty cuts the board decided
that no spcclﬁc information on any
cuts by the universities will hr: for-
wurdcd to the legislature and the
DOB. Early in the meeting
iiingliamton President Clifford D.
Clark said. "We may not be under
arty legal obligation to forward
dccisions on cuts prior to the adop-
tion of the budgct by the
legislature.“ At tltc end of the
meeting Wharton said that it would
be to SUNY's benefit to not spccify
wltcrc the program cuts would fall
when approaching the DO”.

The new tcntrilivc plan would in-
clude. with thc tuition increase. the
$25 "compuicr fee" which thc cx-

 

WE NEED:

An A.M.I.A. Student Assistant for the
remainder of the Spring 1983 semester

YOU WILL NEED:

- a thorough knowledge of all
intramural sports

- an ability to handle yourself in
emergency situations

- good office techniques

APPLICATIONS

are now being accepted at the Intramural Office,
PE 1108 (next to the vending machines).
Deadline is Thursday, March 3 at 6PM. Applicants
will be chosen for interviews for more information.
Call the intramural office only at 457-5203.

(Applications for Student Assistant positions for I 983-!984 will
be announced at a later date).

 

 

ccutivc budget had originally pro-
posed as a scperatc ice. Wharton
said that. "Including the fee as part
of the tuition will make the amount
subject to thc Tuition Assistance
Program (TAP) and somewhat
easier for students with financial
need to absorb."

“The computer fcc added to the
tuition increase was a victory for
SASU." said chlcr. He added
that SASU pusltcd for llti: change.
“Although sometimes we ttrc down
played by the board. when we get a
good idea tltcy listen," ltc said.

“The situation is still a disaster,”
continued chlcr. "We (SASU)
ltad some ltlctls to save money and
prevent dorm incrcttacs hut thcy
wcrc not considcrcd. We are not
pleased with any cost increases to

the students."

“Cuts at the various campuses of
programs and faculty will be left up
to those institutions," said Harry
Splndlcr. _Vicc Chancellor for
Business and Finance. But he add-
cd that the board will have to
oversee and make some decisions to
insure that some programs do not
disappear altogether from the
SUNY system. “We can't all
eliminate the same thing." he said.

On Monday. Feb. 28. students
will have a cltancc’ to lobby
legislators on the issue of tltc budget
and to express their concerns.
SASU has organized this lobby and
rally day at the state capital accor-
ding to chlcr, “because we knew
the battle over the budget would be
difficult this year." chlcr added
that SASU has been planning this
lobby effort for the past couple of
months attempting to get support.
ilc anticipated a turnout between
800 and 1,000 people. i 1
