periences.“ stressed i’ogue.

cluding faculty. students. and ad-
ministrators have been planning

World Week since August.

Pogue views World Week as.
“One of the most Important under-
takings this university has had.
Tltcrc are so many people mobilized
around it. And unlike Community-
Universlty Day. which lasts one
day. this lasts for six days. so if you
miss one day. you can pick up
something else tontorrow."

The week will begin with opening
remarks by President O'Leary
followed by an international sing-u-

long with the University Chorale in
the Main Lounge of the Campus
Center at 12:15 pm.

dreds of letters were sent out to col-
leges and ttttiversities in the region;
45 letters to SUNY Central Ad-
ministrators; 200 letters to com-
munity organizations. some of
which will be participating iii the
Week's Ethnic Block Party. Pogue

Shane. He maintained that if there
was more student interest. the
department could increase the
nttmbcr of students that could be
sent abroad and specific programs
could also be increased.

if any studctrt has a desire to
study abroad. Shane encourages
them to visit his office. “We
(Albttny) itttve one of the larger

selections with lS-ift programs. If

our program doesn't ltave it. we

Social acceptance of alcohol has a bitter twist

By Mark Gesner

Alcohol is a drug. it is the most
socially accepted drug in society to-
day. Alcoholism is the disabling
condition resulting front uncon-
trolled drinking. "in terms of
system-wide damage to the body,
nothing comes close to
alcoholism." said Middle Eartlt

Coordinator D, -
David Jenkins. r

gers a different

reaction in each

However, a Middle Earlit tape en-
titled Decision Making About
\Drinklng docs state that "alcohol.
taken in small doses. tends to act
like a mild tranquilizcr . . . heavy
intake of alcohol can serve as an
anesthetic — anesthctlzing the
deepest levels of brain function.”

Although alcohol itas been pro-
vcn to be a potcttt drtrg. statistics
show about seven otrt of tert adults
drirtk alcoholic beverages. “iiooze
is a very generally acceptable thing.
It's available. and it does a very
good job on what it intends to do."
explairtcd .lohn Dtrblirtski. Coor—
dittator of Education at St. Peter's
Alcoholism Rehabilitation Center
(SI’ARC).

"Alcohol happens to be the most
trcccssiblc artd most approved drug
irt society." said Jenkins. “The at-
Iitttde itt society is that it‘s not a
drug."

Matty positive myths about
drinking are continually expressed
in tire tttcdia. ('otnmort false beliefs
say that drinking will make you
mature, tnorc manly, and more ses-
trally able. Another myth defines
drtrnkcness as a lttrrrtorotrs state.
“TV attd movies tettd to glamorile
the 'fnttrty drunk.‘ hut irt real life
getting drunk is Itot funny." warns
tire Decision [flaking rifllllll Drink-
ing tape.

Perhaps the rttost universal
rcasort for consuming alcohol is to
relieve stress. irt tltc college at-
tttospltcrc, stress oftert appears to
be the corttrttott dertotttittator. "i
don‘t think there is arty doubt that
tlte students today are nrrdcr a lot
rttore stress than they used to be,“
Jenkins commented.

“Social life on campus is more a
stressful sitttatiott tltart it is art act of
enjoyrttenl." said Dttblittski. “it's a
rrtatter of being ‘().i\'."'

Tlte rttaitt reason why the effects
of alcohol are urtclcar itt tlte college
studertl is because of his or Itcr
physical condition. Hence. the pat-
tcrrts of dependency are ttot readily
apparent. “Their habits could he
the scare as an adult, bttt the condi-
tiort will not show as ttttrclt because
of tire student‘s physical shape,"
Jenkins pointed otrt.

it is crucial to realize that
alcoholism and alcohol abuse.
wltich is rttore common is college
students, are two different pro-
bictns.

“Alcoholism is a disease which is
primarily chronic. affecting the en-
tire person in his physical. emo-
tional, mental attd spiritual aspects
of life. Artd it is protte to relapse,"
explained Dublinski.

For a lottg titrte, alcohol was
thought of as merely a crutch for
tire weak ittdividtral. Now, the ef-
fects of alcoholism are seen itt a
tnore complete ligltt. “The uni-
queness of tire disease is that it ltus
some defirtite effects on lite wltolc
body,” said Dublinski.

The physical changes irt alt
alcoholic are easy to detect. accor-
ding to Dublinski. Damage to the
liver. especially cirrhosis (scarring
of the liver). is readily apparent.

However. the crnoliottal artd
spiritual changes are rtot so visible.
I‘A person has to protect himself itt

peers." said Dublinski. "They have
to alter their behavior and begin a
process of denial. They begin to
withdraw and isolate themselves
from society. The end of isolation is
destructive."

“Alcohol abuse." said Jenkins.
"is the use of alcohol which
becotnes a problem for that in-
dlvldtral or any other individual."

Additionally. Dublinski said that
in alcohol abuse "the drinking is
done for some other reasons. it
could be to keep up with peers or
mask problems. One can abuse
alcohol on a temporary basis. it's a
one shot deal.

Wltetltcr it's alcoltolisnt or
alcohol abuse. it is often difﬁcult
for anyone to realise that they have
a problctn. A Middle Earth tape
called Recognizing Drinking Pru-
blems offers some crucial questions

to the person questioning personal
drinking habits. Do you drink to
meet people. to have a good time.
or to face difﬁcult situations like
dates or interviews? Do you keep a
bottle handy or drink alone? These
are all questions the tape suggests
an Individual should ask him or
herself in trying to define a drinking
problem.

"You should particularly con-
sider the possibility of a drinking
problem if you find that drinking
helps you to avoid or deal with
stress." the tape concluded.

Artothcr way people are alcrtcd
about their problem drinking is
when friends and family mention
the appearance of behavioral
cltnttges. in fact, friends and
families becotne so distraught over
the problem drinker that they seek
personal aid for themselves.

AI-Anon is a group which deals
solely with the people affected by
the alcoholic. “it's a family illness.
Everybody who lives with the pro-
blem drinker is affected." explain-
ed Albany District Representative
for AI-Anon Elizabeth Moore.

"We are there to improve the
quality of our own lives." said
Moore. "We try to find what it is
that we can do to alter our lives to
live serenely with the active illness."

One of the beliefs Al-Anon
fosters is that It is important to live
and let live. “When the spouse or
friend no longer contributes to the
aicoltoiie's life. the individual will
begin to look at himself. This
means to Just not participate in
rescue anymore. it doesn't mean
not giving support in other ways."
commented Moore.

Al-Anon teacltcs its members to

take the focus off the alcoholic and
put it on oneself. Moore stated that
members must “realize you have no
power over this person's problem.
You didn't cause it. you can't con-
trol it, you can't cure it. You must
obtain freedom for yourself."

There are active ways to help the
problem drinker recover. Accor-
ding to Jenkins. one must become
assertive and get the person to see
the patterns of their drinking
behavior. it is always important to
confront the drinking behavior. not
the individual. "When you eon-
front them. you are continuing to
say i value you, i care about you,
and i don't want to see you hurting
yourself or others." Jenkins said.
“We do things ranging from con-
doning to consoling.’I is what
Jenkins explained as the ﬁrst reac-
tion to the problem drinker. “We
enable them to drink by giving them
excuses to do so.

if you or a friend itas a problem
with alcohol. there are several
sources of help and infortrtation
you cart turn to.

faith ltouse. offers an Al-Anon
