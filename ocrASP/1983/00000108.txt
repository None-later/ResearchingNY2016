A common area damage deposit with a
possible maximum of 550 may be required
for all students living in campus dormitories
next semester. according to former SUNY
Associate Vice Chancellor of Strident Af-
fairs Ronald Bristow.

The proposed deposit is currently being
considered by SUNY Central. If the pro-
posal is accepted. cach SUNY School would
decide whether or not the policy would be
put ittto effect on its campus. Iiristow said
The amount of the deposit. to bc determin-
ed by each SUNY branch. would reflect the
severity of the vandalism or the campus.

Under the common arett damage deposit
proposal if vandalism were to occur. an at-
tempt to find the perpetrator would be
made first said Bristow. Iftlte gttilty party is
found. he/shc alone would be held respon-
sible for payment. If. however, no
perpetrator is found. those responsible for
the area would share the cost. Ilristow
pointed out that. by implementation of the
deposit. a simple shift of responsibility
would be taking place. As it works now.
said Bristow. when no guilty party is found.
the damage is payed for ottt of thc universi-
ty's general operations budget. which is
composed of rental monies. The deposit
would place the burden of payment for
damage on those responsible for the area.
instead of on all students Iivirtg on campus.

SASU opposes implementation of the
deposit. SASU President Jim Tierney said.
"This is something they (the Central Ad—
ministration) ltavc bcctt trying to stop for
years and years." According to SASU posi-
tion paper on the damage deposit. im-
plctncnttttion of the deposit Is "without suf-
I'I'ct'cnt Jitsttlicatton.” At this titttc SASU

holds this position for the t'oltowmg
reasons. as stated in the paper:

p the current university bookkeeping
system does not distinguish repairs due to
normal "wear and tear" from repairs due
to vandalism.

p ifenacted, the policy would cause cam-
pus students and administrators to lose in-
centive to identify common area damage
perpetrators since damage could more casi-
ly be assessed against the fee.

p the proposal places the financial
responsibility for damage done in a par-

recently replaced Bristow. feels that in the
absence of another plan. this proposal Is “a
beginning." Hostetter agrees that there
may be other solutions to the problem of
vandalism. but none have yet been put for-
ward. He also feels that “ there is nothing
like the collection of money" to inspire
students to fight against the vandalism of
their areas. in his opinion. it Is unfair to
assess deposits to campuses without a van-
dalism problem. so that is why there will be
an option. the deposit will enable campuses
to do something about the problem If it ex-

e yourself in a

ists. in response to one of the comments in
the SASU paper. Hostetter agreed that, at
times. it is difficult to determine normal
wear and tear from vandalism. but in
general. this is not a problctn. As far as in-
ccntivc to identify pcrpctrators. he feels
that it is up to the students to dctcrntinc the
effectiveness of identification. Ilostcttcr
was unaware of arty charges that the cost of
,implcmcnting the deposit may be greater
than the damage itself.

In the fall of l98l. a similar deposit was
proposed within SUNY Central according
to SASU. Although many campuses oppos-

I—Iovvto have class between. classes.

 

ed the idea at the time they showed no ob-
jection to other campuses implementing a
deposit. However. no action was taken by
the SUNY Board of Trustees. and discus-
sion of the fee was abandoned. In January
of this year. discussion of the deposit began
again.

"It has long been the contention of
SUNY that many NYS legislators desire a
damage fee in response to reports of wide-
spread vandalism" according to SASU
literature. SASU has discovered that SUC
Morrlsville and Canton have already
established common area damage fees
without approval from SUNY Central.
These fees, according to SASU. were
established in violation of SUNY.

SUNYA Director of Residential Life.
John Martone said that he had no opinion
on the common area damage deposit at this
time, since he is,at present unaware of im-
portant details regarding the proposal. Un-
til he knows the "pluses and minuscs,"
Martone said that he was “concerned
enough not to make a comment.“ He did.
however. say that Albany had a good repor-
ting systcm for vandalism. and that “we
don‘t have that extensive a problem." At
present. said Martone. only a small percen-
tage of students are involved In appropriate
behavior. The director stressed that tltere
has been good cooperation between
students, the campus judicial system and
residence staff. Before deciding upon an
opinion of the proposition. Martone wants
to see its guidelines and discuss the deposit
with students. including the Quad Board.

According to Murtonc, there is no way of
knowing. at this time. who would make the
decision for this campus if such a proposal
was passed by the Central
Administration. [ I
