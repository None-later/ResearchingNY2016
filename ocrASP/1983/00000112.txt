been," said a disappointed Sauers
as he perused the statistics sheet
after the game. “Defensively, we
didn't do a good job. There were
too many uncontested shots. We
didn't bother their shooters."

Unlike last year, that opening
round loss negated the Danes'
chances of gaining an NCAA bid.
The consolation game was played as
a matter of pride as the Danes were
looking to avoid the same
disasterous fate which they had suf-
fered in the 1982 tourney. The
Danes handily defeated the Univer-
sity of Buffalo Bulls by it points.
The Bulls were 90-66 losers in their
first round game to the hosting
Potsdam Bears. The Bears went on
to win the tournament and will host
the East regional of the NCAA this
weekend (see side bar).

For Seras, this will be his first

status in Division 1. He was selected
to travel to the Division I cham-
pionships in his freshman year
following a second place ﬁnish at
the Division lii nationals, but did
not compete due to illness

Scras defeated Steve lkada of
MIT, 11-4 in the opening round. He
then defeated John Carroll
College’s Marty Joseph, 8-7 to ad-
vance to the semi-final round. He
met Darryl Leslie, the eventual
champion and was winning 5-4
when Leslie was awarded a point
for stalling by Scras. The tnatch
went into overtime and Leslie ekcd
out a narrow victory, 3-2. Scras
came back in the wrestle-backs to
capture third place by defeating
Perry (irachling of Hiram College
by a pin and with a 9-7 victory over
(ilassboro's Kevin lirockway.

Seras was named on almost every
ballot of the coaches, making him a
wild card. "The vote was over-
whelming for Artdy. He had such
an impressive showing that lite
coaches picked him to represent
Division lit at the NCAAs. i think
he‘s capable of being a Division I
All-American," l)cMeo said.

coaches had the respect for me to
select me as a wild card," scras said.

Bears maul Bengals 94-60
To host NCAA East regional

The Potsdam Bears rolled to victory over the Buffalo State Bengals,
94-60 to capture the SUNYAC Tournament, Saturday afternoon in
Maxcy Hall. The win guaranteed the Bears a spot in the NCAA Tour-
nament and kttockcd the Bengals out of Post-season competition.

Potsdam will host the Eastern Regional of the NCAAs this
weekend, facing either ltbaca or the Rochester institute of Technology
in the first rottrtd. The Union Dutchmen and the Hartwick Warriors
are the other two learns competing in the regional.

The Bears raced out to a quick 5-0 lead over Buffalo State and never
looked back en route to their second SUNYAC crown in the past four
years. Potsdam was led by Tournament MVP Leroy Witherspoon,
and All-'I'ournament teatn members Gary Sparks and Bill Perkowski
who combined for half of the liears' 45 ﬁrst half points.

“We played very well. We played as well as we can and tile best
team has in a SUNYAC Tournament.“ Potsdam head concit Jerry
Welsh said.

The Bears had defeated the University of Buffalo Bulls, 90-66 on
Friday night to advance to the finals in the tournament. Potsdam was
once again led by the trio of Witherspoon, Sparks and l’crkowski.
Sparks had three thunderous first halfdunks to ntove the Bears ottt to
an insurmountable lcad.

Sparks play ignited the crowd and his team. Since his rctttrn from
academic suspension, Sparks has led the Bears in their late season
surge, that has seen them capture the SUNYAC-East and now the
SUNYAC Championships. l’otsdnni will be looking to return to the

‘ Final Four and the national title game. The Bears lost to Wabash in
the ciitlittpiottsitip game last year anti have been in the title game three
