The Albany State junior varsity basketball team ex-
tended its string of victories to l0 games Saturday
ttigltt witlt a l()l-79 victory over tltc jayvee squad frottt
New l’ttltz.

The witt gave the Danes a 13-5 record, which marks
tltc best record for a .I.V. team frottt Albany since tltc
1978-79 season, whctt that team wcttt i(t-4. It is also
the third best record ever for it junior varsity team Iterc
at Albany.

Saturday's game was tltc second titttc during tltc
streak that tltc Dtutcs have scored more than 100 points
(they scored 106 vs. Schenectady ('ottttttttttity College).
“We don‘t Itavc tltc explosive scorers, bttt everybody
Ittts bcctt executing well on offense," said Albany State
head cottclr Barry (‘ttt'anattglL

The defense has also cscctrtcd very well over this
span. Albany has turttcd many close games ittto
blowottls with tltcir pressure-style tlci'cttsc. “Wc‘vc
Ittken teams rigltt ottt of titcit offenses." tcrtttu‘kcd
(‘avarttattglL

The Danes did trot look like it lctllll riding a wittttittg
streak itt the game's first half. They got off to a slug-
gish start and found Ihctttsclvcs trailing til halftime
39-35.

“We were ovcrconfidcttt cotttittg ittto the gatttc,“
said (‘avanttttglr “We saw they (New l’trlt/t only had
seven guys on tltcir Icttltl and we thought we could rtttt
right over them."

“Our defense wasn't good and we weren‘t patient

on offense" remarked the Albany coach, describing
the team‘s first ltalf play.

C D' didn't have tttttclt to say to his players at
halftime except go out there ttttd play the way yott are
capable of playing.

Albany did just that as they scored l5 consecutive
points, 20 of the first 22, to begin tltc second half.
After opening up tltc 55-4] lead. Albany coasted the
rest of tltc way on rotttc to their 22 poittt victory.

The Danes second half surge was led by reserve for-
ward chf (icicr. (lClL‘i‘ connected for lit points, many
of Iltctt frottt the outside. “Jeff is starting to regain his
otrtsidc touch that llL‘ had earlier itt the scitson" said
(‘ttvatnattglL

The Danes also received strong efforts frotn tltc
other ntctttbcrs of their bettclt. Robert (‘wirko did a
good job rebounding and sopltmorc Steve Adam itit
for It) points. (itrrrrd Vic (lcarhcad camc oft tltc bench

Albany poured irt (to points itt tltc second half, main-
