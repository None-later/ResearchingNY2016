By Bill Brewster
STAFF II'RI I'EN
A principal policy-forming bod—y
on campus. The University Senate.
has the responsibility to make deci-

‘ sions that directly affect university

policy on campus. but according to
several student scnntors. the work

is ttot being done cl'l‘icicntly.

“The Senate could do a lot
more." said Sittdcnl Senator Phil
Gentile. who represents off-campus

students. "it has the potential for

handling a lot more than it does."

"l tltiiik most students in the
Senate would say the process to get
a bill through is very lengthy," said
Colonial Quad Senator Cathy
Lasusa. "There are always things
to be done. but the senate doesn't
incct often enough, and some coni-
tnittccs rarcly meet at all.

The Senate is composcd ol’ 22
students, 22 administrators. 22
faculty members. arid scvcral cx-
ol'l'icio members. Each member
must sit on at least one ot‘ tltc nine
councils. which are thcn broken
down into 32 subcommittees. liach
council and subcommittee deals
with a certain area.

According to Gentile. most
legislative work is done iii the coun-
cils and subcommittees. When it
bill is drafted atid approvcd by a
council, it then goes to thc lixv
ccutivc Council which must ap-
provc the bill before it passes otito
the full Senate floor.

"I think there are some, students
included." said Robert (iibson,
Scnator rcprcsciiting C.U.E., "who
see the Sctiatc to be where tltc itc-
Iion is. but the action is in the coliti-
cils. Thc Senate should tncrcly
review the Acts of the councils." he
said.

According to Lasusa. the conti-
cils and subcommittees hold
meetings whenever the chairman of
a particular council or subcommit-
tcc schedules one. The fiiil Scnatc
only meets the second Monday of
every month from 3:30 pm to 5:00
pm, eight times a year. and the ex-
ccutivc council mchs approximatc~
ly a wch before them. The result.
according to State Quad Senator
.lct‘l‘ Schneider. mcans that agenda
items bccomc backloggcd. arid
meetings are rushed iii order to gct
as much done as possible.

“The organilntion is not wltat it
could he." said Schneider. “The
mcctings arc vcry official and very
often things happen too
qtiick...hcl'orc you realize it. The
professors want to get home by
fire, so they rush and table things.
A backlond results."

Schneider recalled a full Sciiatc
niccling when his committcc wanted
to amend a bill already on the floor.
“indian Quad Senator April Gray
ritiscd her hand. but the chair didn‘t
l’CCOgtll/L‘ her.“ he said. “All of ti
sutldcn, the bill was passed and thc
mccling was over."

Sclincidcr said it was an impor—
taut amendment that allowed
students to reschedule a final exam
without conditions if they had lhrcc
scheduled the same day. He cs-

he explained. "A iiiiinhcr were

He went on to say that, as chair-
man, he more readily gets a sense of
what’s happening at the iticciitigs.

committee chairs often call
meetings only once a month." She
added that no students were council
chairs this year.

Lasusa agreed that having few
meetings makes it difficult to main-

tain continuity and often results in
laziness and apathy even though
there’s a large agenda. She noted
that the Senate handlcs all academic
issues including. for example. a bill
requiring students be notified of a

hold on their records by‘the reistrar.

She said that often the faculty
and administration members are on
the Senate for longer periods of
time that students and are therefore
more used to the proceedings.
Because of this, she said. they have
an advantage during the pro-
ceedings and oftentimes students
trying to speak on the floor are
quickly ruled out of place because ’
of improper proceedurc.

The infrequent meetings and fast-
paccd procedures of full Senate
meetings help to make the process
of passing bills more tedious and
difficult. say its members.

This year, according to SA Presi-
dent Mike Corso, who is the only
student on the Executive Council,
the fact that there are no students
chairing arty of the committees is
"unfortunate."

"The rcprcsctitation is fair." he
said, “bill l'd love it it" there were
moic students." l-lc noted that last
year the Student Affairs Council
had a student chairman but not the
year.

(icntilc agreed, saying, "The big-
gest problcnt is the low number of
students. but I don't think the
faculty looks to exploit their posi-
tion." I y
