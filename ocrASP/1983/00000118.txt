UAS gives Glen

\

House to SA

 

By Heidi Gralln

STA FF WRITER

 

UAS plans to give Glen House. a ltouse with 4 acres
of property adjacent to Camp Dippikill, to SA. accor-
ding to Ronnet Roth. Chair of the Board of UAS.

Roth said no funds for the properly. appraised at
$54.000.were to be transferred between SA and UAS
in the transaction.

Currently. Glen House is used as a youth hostel as
well as a place for SUNYA students to stay while at
Dippikill. Camp Dippikill Director Richard Nelson
said that “this proposal will change absolutely nothing
in the operation of the house."

“It ’s a valuable piece of
property for student

government to have. ”
— UAS General Manager
Norbert Zahm

The reasons for “selling” Glen House. explained
UAS General Manager Norbert Zalrm. are that “it's
an expense to the corporation but it's a valuable piece
of property for student governrucm to have."

Zahnt added that UAS has been losing approximate-
ly.$‘l2.()00 a year in operating Glen Hottse.

Since SA already owns Camp Dippikill, there could
be many “operating advantages" in having SA own
Olen House as well. explained Zahnr.

UAS has accepted a plan to make a line change in
their bridge! once a year for four years, transferring
the motley saved from not paying the upkeep of the
property back into the butlget. This will save UAS

544.000 in that time spurt. nearly the estimated cost of

the property. “The transfer of funds win I
only in bookkeeping." said Zahm.
Nelson estimated that it should
lmately $9500 to operate Glen Hons

Telethon 'cashes in on happy hour

 

By Deb Profeta

ASSOC/2| l'li NIilI'S EDITOR

Fill It to the rim, again. and
again.

That was the scene Thursday as
Telethon celebrated its annual
“Afternoon at the Bars." drawing
crowds into the Lamp Post.
Washington Tavern. Long Branch
and O‘Heaney's.

According to Telethon Co-chair
Eileen Kozin, "The spring weather
added to the unbelievable
turnout." which had a total atten-
dance of about 1.000.

According to Kozin. Telethon
sold $4 tickets for all the beer one
could drink. She estimated that
$3.300 was grossed, approximately
$1.800 profit.

The turnout was great at every
bar. said Telethon Co-chalr of
Events Lorri Kosterieh. “The Long
Branch had a line formed at two
o‘clock." she said. explaining that
the kegs were not even tapped until ‘

p.m.

Every bar was "swamped" with

people, said Kosterieh. With the
support of SA and the classes ofBJ.
84 and 85. all of whom donated
$250 each. the event was a success.
This money helped to cover
overhead expenses such as kegs.
bartenders. bouncers and any
damage to the bars. explained
Kosterieh.

“Afternoon at the Bars" is one
of the biggest Telethon events, said
Kozin. especially beneficial in get-
ting people into the spirit of
Telethon.

The success of the event was due
largely to the “phenomenal
cooperation“ at the bars by the
businesses and students, Kozln add-
ed. “This is the only way to get
owners of bars involved. We sup-
port thc bars annually and this is
one way they show their apprecia-
tion. We couldn't do it without
their support."

Kozin emphasized the involve-
ment of the Lamp Post and owners
Roger Martel and Tony Sabatino.
saying the bar was "totally

US multi-nationals create
cultural conflict in Korea

By Deb Judge
ASSIK ‘l/l (If le'll'h‘ E ITUR

The American presence in Korea
has produced by-products of which
“Computer Chips. Tourism and
Prostitution" are only a part. ac-
cording to a slide-lecture of that
name by writer and researcher
Maude Easter.

“i thought that title would bring
tons in." she said. surveying the au-
dience of about 30. predominantly
women. in LC 22 Wednesday night.

iiarhie dolls," in Eastcr's verbal
arid visual depiction of American
firms" impact on the women and
culture of South Korea.

liastcr traveled throughout Asia
for three years. doing research and
writing for the American Friends
Society Committee. She is now on
the staff of the Committee for a
New Korea Policy and a lobbyist at
the State Legislature.

Although Asia is a l2-hour‘s
flight away. Easter says that work-
ing at the legislature “I see hun-
dreds of problems of women in
Korea that 1 deal with every day in
the New York State Legislature."

She continued. drawing parallels
between. for instance. the Asian
cotrntry where a woman (undeserv-
iug of a name) is traditionally
known as “Mr. Kim‘s daughter,"
until she is “Mr. Park's wife."
—not much different than the
American woman who drops her
name to assume ltcr husband's; and
where women are not allowed out

it is a country where 75 percent
of the people live below the govern-
ment's decreed poverty level. and
yet where frugal incomes are "total»
ly bombarded by western ad\crli.s-
ing." As illustrated. in a slide of
two Korean boys eyeing toy tanks in
a shop window.

'l'odny. 30 years after the Korean
war. 40.000 U.S. troops remain in
Korea. l-Iastcr said she found the
reasons for the continued presence
compelling ~ including that the
hills make “\vomlcrful terrain for
war games."

As a “hardship post." [Easter

tainment."

A survey conducted by the army
—in an effort to protect their
charges from venereal disease —
located some l0.000 prostitutes
operating in the capital city of
Seoul. “Remember this is always a
factor when you bring American
troops anywhere in the Third
World." she said.

Easter protested that it was not
just the U.S. military. but the U.S.
totrrist industry having an interest
in prostitution. "Tire Hilton. the
Hyatt. the Regency —- they can't be
unaware of the goings-on around
their pools and in their lobbies."

The Korean government not only
approved of this practice. she said.
but praised the women for their
contriiurtion to foreign exchange.

One of the most painful results of
the continued American presence in
Korea. according to iiaster. is the
prolonged division of tire corrrrtry.
Korea was divided in W45 by the
United States and Russia irtto the
Republic of Korea (South) and the
Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea (North). Nearly 40 years
later. Easter maintained the majori-
ty “longs for a day the two parts
can be put back together."

But while the Northern section
ltas a socialist economy which
liaster found “self—reliable." the
South — and its women -— struggles
with a ruarkct economy where
Korean labor fashions goods to be
shipped to American markets,
where mullinatiomtl corporations
are “superimposed on a very poor.
rural society." like an
anachronism.

Here. for example. women are
bound by tradition not to work
after marriage. and where foreign
corporations such as Motorola and
Radio Shack have incorporated this
into their hiring policies. The result
is a turning back of women to the
charatcristically rrndcrdcvclopcd
task of selling in it by the roadside.

The multinationals first set up
shop in the 60‘s and 70's, liastcr
said. “primarily to take advantage
of the low wages. and long hours"
of factory labor supplied by Korean
women. Here is where the Mattel
corporation. nurunfncturer's of
liarbic Dolls. relocated after mov-
ing first to Southern California.

organized labor. according to
liaslcr.

Telethon." The owners designed
their own gimmick to raise addi-
tional funds. according to Kozln.
which netted approximately $500.

Martel and Sabatino sold
balloons for $1 apiece. each balloon
containing a ticket redeemable for
one of 500 prizes solicited by the
Lamp Post owners from area
distributors. The prizes included
clocks, buttons. wall hangings, key
chains. T-shirts and other tokens.

“The event. was very
successful." said Martel. “better
than when done in the past." He
also stressed that the students were
very cooperative.

The only problem with the event.
maintained Kozin. was that
Telethon had to be "extra careful
about the age limit because the
university demanded it as a result of
the new state law."

Despite this. Kozin felt the event
went well. with “no hassles." She
added. “the Chairpersons. Tim.
Lorri. and Eddie. did an excellent
job in organizing the event. There
was no problems at the bars and it

was a fun event.”

Kozin extended special thanks to
all students who contributed to
making the event such a success.

 

 

’1)er Wale——

I’m going to celebrate the end of spring finals by
inviting some people for dinner. I'm a little nervous
because I’ve never given a dinner before. in fact, I haven't
spoken to another human being since Election Day.
That's when the woman at the polls asked me what my
favorite party was and I said: “A pajama party."

Anyway, [just bought a cookbook and plan on
serving something from the chapter on poultry. Or else
I'll make chicken.'But I can‘t decide which Celia Wine
to serve: red, white, or rosé?

‘ Out of Touch,

Madison. WI
P.S. Do I serve the wine in glasses or mugs?

Dear Out of Touch,
Years ago, red wine was always served with beef;

white with fish or poultry. But these days, anything

goes. My light, refreshing Celia Lambrusco, Bianco,

and Rosato go perfectly well with any meal.

Just remember to have an extra ice-cold bottle or

two on hand.

By Ute way, I be found that people love my Celia
Wines so much they don I care if you
serve it in glasses, mugs, or

binoculars. ‘
