CAMPUS
STUDENTS

 

As your off-campus representatives of
Central Council. we have had a tough
term in office thus far. The representa-
tion of off-campus students by providing
services and programs is our main goa .
However. our effectiveness is limited
because there Is a lack of communication
to our constituents. the off-campus
students. as well as a lack of particlpa~
tion.

In the past. there has been little if any
relationship between how we act and
represent ou at meetin 9, etc.. and how

on actua ly feel. Since ast semester. we

ave been trying to come up with ways
that we can better serve you. One way to
do this Is by working more closely waith
the Off-Campus Association (OCA). Ar-
ticles that affect off-cam us students are
being researched and su mitted to "Get-
ting Off." In addition, we are tryin to
educate and recruit students regarding
the severe budget situation that all SUNY
students are facing right now. The pro-
posed monetary increases from students
and planned cutbacks in services affect
off-campus students in a special way
however. As many of you may know,
one of the "solutions" is the elimination
of the Wellington bus run as well as the
Implementation of a bus fee.

A secoond plan is to let you know who
we are. Probably most of the times that
you hear about Central Council is when
there is a problem or when an election ls
coming up. Now that the bye election is
over. we would like you to know who
your thirteen representatives are:

Lee Eisner . . . . , . . . . ..434-672‘J

Mitch Flick . . , . . . . . . ..438-2887

hob Folchetit . . . . , . . “4650718

Dan Robb . . . . . . . . . . . 44941044

Nell Seigal . . . . . . . . . .465-7087

Mark Seigelstein . . . . . . .449-3044

Ellun Steinfteld . . I . . . . .489-2541

Gregg Stevens . . . . . . . 462-4763

Torn Webster . . . . . . . “438-2529

 

A Message to Off-Campus Students

We would like to welcome the four
new members who were recently
elected:

Dan Bertrand . . . . . . . . .372-5153
Joe Ranni . . . . . . . . . . . .436-1450
Judy Rivera . . . . , . . . . 405-8064
Neil Shapiro . . t . . . . . . 434-6479

We urge you to get in touch with us at
these nurn ers or at the SA office
(7-8078) If you have an idea or a pro
blem and especially if you want to get in-
volved In any way. Your suggestion can

come a reality no matter how Impossi-
ble it may seem to you.

Two accomplishments thus far directly
benefIItIng you are the establishment of a
weight room In Alden Hall of Alumni
Quad and the development of a pro-
grammln line In the budget of OCA.
The welg t room has free weights and is
open to students upon presentation of
and 10 card. The programming line will
enable OCA to s onsor events. Comin
up Is SUNY ngﬁf at Cahoots and an
outdoor party in Washington Park.

There are also things that we would
like to see accomplished before the end
of the semester. For exam la, the forma-
tion of the first SUNYA lock Associa-
tion waould be a great chance to make
off-campus students feel like they live in
an actual neighborhood Instead of just
leasing out an apartment. Also. there is a
need to improve the services available to
off-campus students on the uptown cam-
pus. llke Increased locker space for
storage while at classes or work.

We hope that this helps ou to unders-
tand us better and, firm ly. lust think
about wirat you have read and the things
that you have wanted to say or what you
wanted to see accomplished.
