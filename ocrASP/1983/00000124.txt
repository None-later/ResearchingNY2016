Maybe they lelt they could reach a new au-

meone would try to sell a song he can't
sing. ugghi it's great that a musician tries to
break out ol his caste, but Techno~Hendrtx
is a bit silly. The synthesizers. let alone the
people who play them. can't begin to grasp
the ieeilng behind .iiini's playing. With little
doubt. this record will be the year's most
obnoxious.

it really is a shame. Solt Cell had such
promise when they completely turned
around the old Motown sound. creating an
enduring number one hit last year. instead.
vocalist Marc Almond and writer Dave Ball
got caught up In their synthesizers and
sleaze and ended up with "The Art at Fall-

Don't let advertising tool you, this album is
bad. it Is two sides and an EP of the seedy
world ol love turned upside down. As Marc
Almond explains. "l'm interested in the dirt

listening to the record. the point is palnluily
obvious. Although musicians have been
singing about the perverse (or years. when

synthesizers become too overbearing In

___.___.____,_.___.._._..-—
Delany. who wrote his first published
novel The Jewels a] Aptor at the age of
nineteen (and [our other novels In the next
three years) has written some at the most
popular and controversial science lictlon in
the last twenty years. He has won the
prestigious Nebula Award 'tour times as
well as the Hugo Award. and has been
described in The New York Times Book
Review as “. . .the most interesting author of
science lictlon writing in English today."

Delany's best known novels include:
Babel-i7 (his lirst Nebula winner). The
Einstein intersection, Noua. Dhalgren. and
Triton. He is also the author ol two
volumes of essays: The .Ieruuliiinged Jaw
and Starboard Wine. and an extended
essay-memoir on urban COITUHUHUS.
Heavenly Braaklast.

Born and raised in Harlem. Delany. who
attended the Bron'x High School oI
Science and dropped out ol City College in
the 60's. is emphatic about the possibilities
of science lictlon as a genre. in a recent in-
terview he stated: “Science lictlon is one at
the low places where you get a chance to
separate the object lrom the subject.
Hopeluily. the next step is to take control I
at lt...not as though everything out there is

a way that is not uselul beyond a certain
point. We must take responsibility lor what
we do. but one ol the things we can do is
change the world around us."
Asked about the prevalence at strong
character portrayals at both women and
blacks In his lictlon. Delany stressed the
usefulness oi science lictlon lor presenting
the particularized llgure: “...certalnly peo-
ple who come through what one has to call
- lor want of a better word - marginal social
matrices. their relationship to the obiect has
been very dillerent. It has been inlluenced
by dillerent social Issues. . .and their percep-
tion at things - our perception at things —
tend to be very dillerent. In science lictlon
their views are presented as rich. human.
individual. generating great insight...“
An avowed leminlst. Delany lurther
stated that one ol the main reasons he
became interested in science lictlon as a
young writer "was the potential for the
women characters...there was always a hit
tnore room for all the characters to
dramatize what was going on through ac-
tion." He noted further that science fiction.
which includes 16 per cent oi all published
lictlon in the United States today Is presentv
ly read by an audience which is cornposerl
at ()0 per cent male readers and lit) pom-m
lernale readers. mostly between the ages oi
iii and 25. This is in contrast to the tt‘urltfr
ship ol thirty years ago. which consisted ‘
primarily at male readers under the age oi .
17. He also noted as “almost it truism" that ‘
"the most interesting science lictlon writers
now are women." He recently delivered a
conlerence paper on the work oi .loanna .

somehow a projection oi the inner sell...ln

their music and subdue the vocals. There's
a competition between Almond and the in-
struments with the machine winning and
indulging in drawn out solos. In the end.
there's not much holding the music
together.

Technically. David Ball Is a talented syn-
theslst. but technical virtuosity is only hall‘
oi music. Anyone can learn to play an in-
strument. but It takes someone with a
special talent to make a song come alive.
The musician must have that certain quali-
ty. soul It you will. to make his songs work.
When Solt Cell recorded this album, they
left their soul at home. in the hands ol so-
meone else. their songs like “Forever the
Same" and “Loving You. Hating Me"
could be reworked Into hits. Undoubtedly,
Solt Cell can put together a pop song. but
unfortunately they destroy it in the process
of recording it. Enough is enough and one
gets bored by the end at the record.

Throughout the whole album the syn-
thesizers are overwhelming and the vocals
become too tiring. so what is left? The lyrics
and the song structure. While they deal
with the darkest side of love. the words are
catchy.

;Who's the person you woke up next to to-

a 9 i
It you were a little bit older you might have

to .

This just about sums up Salt Ceil's sublect
matter. They may or may not have the
ability to write good lyrics. but they do have
potential. Too bad he can't utilize himsell
ellectlvely.

Underneath all the technology are a few
songs trying to get out. There are a low
numbers on the album that really could
sound good. but they are choked by the
synthesizers. it would take a musician with
the skill of a heart surgeon to cut away at
the song until the basics were left. Then.
good music could be made. Salt Cell Is one
oi the techno-pop bands that haven't yet
realized that music tells a story and sets a
mood; it doesn't get caught up In the in-
