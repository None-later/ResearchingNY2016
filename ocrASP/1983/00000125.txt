No one cares

To the Editor:

Everyone is always criticizing Albany for its apathy. No
one ever gets involved and no one ctircs. Well. this is cer-
tainly the cttsc when it comcs to the Yahtzee Champion-
sltips. No one we know cares.

With this in mind. we present these fascinating itctns
wc'd rather sec than two tisclcss rolls per week: i) UAS cx-
plains why Mrs. Stein‘s famous steak and lobstcr tails dish
will ncvcr make recipe night. 2) in depth interviews with the
members of tltc Philip M. Schuyler basketball team. 3) A
cartoon from someone whose nlphnbct transcends the letter
“Z”. 4) A running count of everyone who knows the
names of their Central Council rcprcscntivcs. 5) A runniitg
count of the number of times in rt week that you can wait
for a bus for an hour and then have four show up at once.
6) Art expose revealing the “best” bathrooms on campus.
using a weighted average of cleanliness. comfort. and graf-
titi.

Most of the time we enjoy what tltc ASP offers.
Sometimes we even like ASPECTS. But when it comes
down to Yrihtzcc Championships. the dice just roll against
you.

plc. tltyscii incltrdcd. believe that ttttcrnptcd rape involves
far more than simply bud “rtitinncrs” and igttorancc.

Mr. Ut'ccnficld implies that its discussion leader I made
no “sinccrc attcntpt to be fair" and criticizes my dccision to
cull ultcrtttitciy on men and women to spctik. Siiicc tltc
discussion largely centered on men's and women’s diffcrcnt
pcrccptions of tltc events in tire play (although there were.
of course. many differing perceptions). alternating
speakers in this way sccrncd the fairest approach. There was
no way of knowing precisely what was in the minds of tlic
many people whose hands were raised, so it was impossible
to select speakers who would guarantee the “orderly com-
munication of ideas" Mr. Greenfield demands. Should i
have called on only the men when discussing a play about a
woman written by a woman—and when the majority of the
audience members were women? it would have been equal-
ly unfair to have excluded the men from the discussion. as
l‘m sure Mr. Greenﬁeld would readily agree. Further. Mr.

Greenfield's suggestion that speakers were intimidated and
embarrassed is contradicted by the fttct that throughout the
evening dozens of people cttgcrly aired their opinions.
Finally. Mr. (‘ircctificld castlgatcs‘rne for failing to be
“objective.” and i must plcttd guilty to that charge. As he
itimsclf points otrt. tltc play dcals with a titrinbcr of very
serious social problems: the mistreatment of convicts in and
out of prison: the limited job opportunities for individuals.
particularly women. coming out of prison: pnrcnts brutally.-
ing children; and rape. i cannot be "objective" when
discussing these problems. i hope tionc of us can.

To the Editor:

I would like to take this time to both congratulate tind
tlittnk all tltosc who participated in this past Monday's Lob-
by Day at the State Capital.

Monday's turnout was the largest in SUNY Albany

history its studcnts on this campus pitiycd their proper role
as tltc lcudcrs uniting SUNY students. Over 1700 Albany
sttidcrils left their cltisscs to talk with State legislators con-
cerning tltc cutbacks which SU NY now faces. 1 fch that this
turnout litis tlctrtonsti’atcd to our clccicd officials that

it has shown that we care about our ctunptts illtd couldn‘t

(irccnficld‘s article which is ltcttrd often in other contcxts
and which therefore tncrits attention. A large portion
(though not all) of the discussion following this play did, its
Mr. (irccnficld notcs. take on tltc character of a debate.
Roughly tltc two “camps” were composed of those who
saw tltc play as feminist and those who did not wish to
describe the play with this label. At some point this issue
bccamc intermingled with the dcfcnsibility of one of the
characters in the play. "Bennie".

it is evident which position on both issues Mr. Grccnt'icld
endorses. However. after making clear his own point of
view and after describing the discussion as a whole as
“rudc. argumentative rhetoric". Mr. Greenfield then

makes it apparent that only these who disagrccd with his
position are to be held responsible for making it such.._ln
point of fact. many people on each side were making
remarks which sparked heated responses from the other.
This would be it minor matter if it did not replicate a
more widespread practice. thcn those who disagree with a
feminist position choose to state their disagreement not in
substantive terms. but rather by characterizing that posi-
tion as "partisan." "biased." "monisllc." “rhetorical,”
“one-sided.“ etc. These kinds of labels have also been used
igainst Socialists and other dcfcndttnts of unpopular
political views. in short. those who are threatened. feel
angry. or fear that which is challenging to the status quo
frequently describe it as “biased.” in contrast to the “ob-
jective” chttrttctcr of their own pesitlon. While it is not
clear to me whether or not it is possible to formulate a non-
prtrtisan stance on any matter of social concern. it is ccr-
ttiinly true that such it stance is not to bc found in many of
tltc contexts where it is cxplcitly or implicitly claimed. in-
cliiding iii this case the stance of Mr. Greenfield.

Ongoing tension

To the Editor:

1 would like to express my opinion concerning the - "i
ing and eternal tension that exists between Alumni (3- .Id
bus ridcrs and Wellington bus ridcrs. l believe the fruit». trig.
may bc ithiL‘ to resolve this long standing conﬂict.

The problem is that Wellington students ltttvc rr it.rrd tinic
getting on it Wellington Bus going (10\Villt)\\lt in lllt.‘ after-
noon. it scents that Aluntni Quad students .ttul tiliiL't'
downtown students crowd on tltc first hits that collle irt
order to get back home promptly. Now. .‘\lllliilii Qiittd
students will tell its that they lttivc to unit for tltc bus iii the
morning. and will try to avoid waiting in tlic til'tci'riouit.

the “11011011 1 propose will ttllott both Alttrtttii Quad
stirdcttts rind Wcllitigtott students to gct buck l'iotit cltisscs
prnrttplly. I propose that till students should get on the first
bus that comes. When .1 Wellington sititiL‘ltl gets on an
Altrttirii bus hc/sltc should Itikc this bus dowit to l)t.tpcr

There are possible mtissivc cutbacks irt bits scrvicc. accum-
