‘I Love NY? campaign a success

 

By Caryn Miske

__________._..._—

In the midst of the I976 crisis. a
campaign was launched to help
New Yorkers feel good about
themselves and what their state has
to offer. Three years and $23
million later the impact of this cam-
paign was phenomenal; travel
revenues of $170.1 million has been
directly attributed to this progrant.
In addition, resultant tourism
created 540.000 jobs within four
years. The "I Love New York"
campaign had paid for itself
already. surpassing expectations by
a tremendous increase in commerce
awareness.

Campaign director Bernard Rot-
man explained the economic impact

of the “I Love New York" cam-’

paign titrotrgh an audio-visual
presentation during the first
tneeting of SUNYA's new Forurrt

pose of the organiration is to pre-

public to understand more fully."

C- , pointed out the realities
of this glamorous campaign at
Tuesday’s gathering. “A great
amount of research must be done in
order to produce the wonderful
commercials you see on T.V. ." said
Rotman. On the basis of solid
research. it was discovered that the
two favorite attractions were the
great outdoors of upstate New York
and New York City, home of the
theatre district and numerous
restaurants. museums artd shops.
By aceentuatlng and marketing the
positive aspects of New York. top-
of—mind awareness (i.e.. the first
place that comes to mind when you
think of vacation) doubled since the
onset of the campaign. according to
Rotman. In fact. advertising
awarertess for New York State rose
to 66 percent of people surveyed.
the ltiglrcst of any U.S. or Canadian
destination matched only by
Florida.

The campaign was tltcn split into
two parts. Rotntarr explained. The
campaign for upstate New York
targeted what people already
wanted outdoor recreation. Travel
to upstate New York increased by
an astounding 85 percent, three

times higher than the U.S. total.
However. the campaign for New
York City proved to be more
challenging. Rotman said.

People associated New York City
with high costs. confusion and
crime. he pointed out. For many
tourists. the negatives overwhelmed
the positive. in order to attract
tourists. the campaign concentrated
on the magnetism of Broadway.
This proved to be a very sttccessftrl
campaign technique. sine New York
has the highest increase in trips (6.3
million) of any state.

When the "i Love New York"
first began. five million dollars was
spent on advertising. in the form of
six weeks of intense and concen-
trated T.V. commercials. These
commercials were taken nation-
wide, but only in the prime
coverage areas, that is, areas which
ltad a high percentage of possible
tourists. Witltout these commercials
the program would not have suc-
cccdcd, Rotrnan said.

However, duririg the rest of the
year the commercials were stip-
plenrented by ptrbllc relations,
which included press releases.

poaters, public service spots and'
promotions on the radio. '

The campaign also implemented
seasonal festivals which focused on
a particular area' of the state.
Celebrities donated their time to
make commercials for these
festivals, since. Rotman pointed
out. it has been proven that
"famous faces sell." Also. in order
to fill empty seats, the. major
airlines would use the “i Love
N.Y.“ commmercials. tacking their
name on the end. This not only
benefited the airlines, who get an
edge on the competition. but it also
is free publicity for the State. -In ad-
dition, vacation packages which in-
cltrde brochures, transportation. ac-
commodations. and cvett theatre
tickets are provided for the conve-
nlcnee of the tourist.

Each year. New York State has
decreased its share of promotional
spending for the campaign. Track-
ing studies have proven that the “I
Love New York" program is very
profitable. yet inflation and budget
cuts will how a drastic impact on
tile campaign. If the State wants to
maintain the program‘s present

   
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
  
  
  

momentum. the necessary funds
must be allocated. something which

"I think that they (Albany State)

forward to getting into the NCAAs.
but we didn't. At least this tourna-
ment cases some of the pain."
