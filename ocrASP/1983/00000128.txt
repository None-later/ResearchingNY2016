A week from this Sunday, the field for the NCAA
basketball tournament will be selected. For a number
of reasons. the once-select field has been gradually in-
creased to where it Is now 52 teams. and that Is too
high a number. For the NCAA tournament to truly be
a national championship. no more than 32 teams
should be involved.

No matter how many teams are involved. there will
always be griping after the selections are made. On the

plain. saying that they deserved to participate. just as
the Bradley Braves and UTEP Miners did last season.
A contributing factor to the controversy is that a large
nrrmber of automatic berths are given out to con-
ference tourtirrntent winners. and some of these win-
ners are of less than championship caliber. which. in
ttrrtl. ctits out a number of deserving teams.

My proposal is to make the March extravaganza a
32-team affair. with the champion winning five games
for the title. It was like this not too many years ago,
btrt the thirst for tnoncy. together with the increasing
power of tire coaches' lobby. have increased the field
so tlrnt coaches' jobs will be a little more 'secure as
rriore of tlrerri reach the NCAA playoffs. tttrd their
schools reap the financial harvest. lit the process. they
are beginning the tarnish the brilliance of the event.

In my 32-tearri tournament. there would be no
autonratic bids. This way. you come closerto getting
the best 32 teams in the corrntry. which is the ultimate
goal. If I were prrttitrg together a torrrrranrcnt for this
season. I would do it like this:

WEST: UNLV. UCLA, St. Peter's. NC State. Mon-
tana. Memphis St. Mississippi. Georgetown.

In this setup, no conference may have more than
four representatives. Also. some teams have been mov-
ed out of their geographic regions to help acheive more
well-balanced rcgionals.

You probably noticed that only one independent.
SW Louisiana. made the list. This isbecause I give
teams in a conference the benefit of the doubt as it is
much harder. in my opinion. for them to achieve an
outstanding record.

Actually. the NCAA will probably never to back to
32 teams. In fact. they will probably expand. and ex-
pand. and expand until 256 Division 1 teams are in-
cluded. Where there's money available. there’s change
possible. .

What the NCAA is doing is ruining a good thing.
their game is better. more popular that the NBA. but
every change that they make brings the college ame
closer to that of the pres. Witness the'shot clock.
three-point goal. and the reliance on television and its
money. The college playoffs should be a select group
so that the regular season means something. and
believe me. with every passing year. its significance
lessens. and that is bad.

In this year's 52-tcam. tournament. it looks as if the
Big East. SEC. Big IO and ACC may all have five
tcarrts involved. depending on Irow many upsets occur
in the conference tournaments. Also wrriting in the
wings are the aforementioned independents. who rrirrst
hold their breaths for a bid.

This year‘s 52 teams is four urorc than last season.
Arr ridditiotrttl preliminary round has been added so

that eight learns will play for the final four spots. It
will take these teams seven wins to take the national ti-
tle. two more wins than the twenty-four scedcd tcatns
need.

Next week we'll look at those conference tour-
naments. and the week after it's the NCAA hash.
while all ends April 4 in Alberquerqiic.

Looking back. the most impor-

four years with the Great Danes is
the friends they have made.
“Something that made it all fun

ASSOC/A TE SPOR TS EDITOR

For four years Phil Pivnick and
Howard Strudler have been the
voices of the Great Danes. This
weekend will mark the ﬁnal broad-
casts of the pair as they travel with
the basketball team to Clinton.
N.Y. for the ECAC Tournament
from Hamilton College.

For four years they have
delivered over the airways of
WCDB the play by play of Albany
football and basketball games to
the university community. They
have described the wins and the
losses. the highs and the lows. Divi-
sion III sports have been an intregal
part of their college careers.

After more than 50 basketball
and 20 football broadcasts
together. the duo looked back on
four years of memories and ex-
periences. Pivnick and Strudler
both did their ﬁrst broadcast in the
spring of their freshman year.
doing basketball games. “Original-
ly it was a small thing. just trying to
see what CDB was all about and it
turned into something mtich
bigger." Strudler said.

The first game they did together
is one they might like to forget. “It
was up in Cortland our freshman
year. Phil and I were itito profes-
sional wrestling and a guy on the
other team. his name wrts Bob
Patch. Ire had long stringy hair and
all of a sudden Phil called him the
Ken I’atera-look-alikc and after
that we went back rind forth talking
about professional wrestling for the
next five minutes." Strudler said.

“We were on the floor larrglritig
and sports director Bruce
Schirrehaus is on the phone with the
engineer saying shut them up. get

them off the air. That was pretty
funny." Pivnick added.

“I also had a great play-by-play
that game. They had a guy about
6'8" with glasses. He looked like he
had a calculator on the side of his
shorts. He made the most awkward
move to the basket and for no
reason I go. he drives from the line
to the lane... ohl what a gawk. I
just blasted it out, I don't know
why. but I did." he said.

Most of the time though. the
broadcasts ran smoothly. After

they know when to speak and when
to let the other person talk. The key
to a good broadcast is timing. ac-
cording to Strudler.

"That and experience. I
remember before a game. when Phil
and I used to do them during
freshman and sophomore year. we
used to write out what we were go-
ing to say on the air. We don't do
that anymore because we know the
basic format now." Strudler said.

The most important element to a

 

broadcast is talking. The listener
nrust be constantly aware of what Is
going on. especially on radio when
there are no pictures to tell the story
for the announcer. “It's hard for
me to keep my emotions and tell the
Iistner what‘s going on.” Pivnick
commented. “It's my job to keep
the listener Informed. I don't

always keep my cool out there. but I
do try. It's hard."

“Once you start thinking about
what you are going to say. that's
when you start getting yourself In

trouble. You just have to let it
flow." Strudler explained. “Phil is
a master of just rambling on."

More than just broadcasting the
Great Dane games. Strudler and
Pivnick have traveled with the
teams. They know the players and
the coaches. particularly the basket-
ball team.

“One of the best things about do-
ing the broadcast is the friendships
with the team. We appreciate what
they do for us as far as performing
on the court and they appreciate us.
We feel welcome all the time and
that's what makes it all the more en-
joyable." Pivnick said.

“One thing that particularly
sticks out about the elassiness of
the people is after the team lost two
years ago in the final game of the
East regional to Potsdam in the
NCAAs. we went down to the
locker room. The locker room was
really down. but I won't forget l’etc
Stanlslr coming up to me and saying
thanks a lot for covering the team.
we really appreciate it. That really
stuck out for me." Strudler said.

Strudler arid Pivnik have had to
deal with the coaches as well; foot-
ball coach Bob Ford and basketball
coach Dick Sauers.

“They tire two real class yotrng
guys. llust think they do a fine job
of reporting college sports on a col-
lege campus." Ford said.

“They‘ve done just a great job.
They rrre loyal fans. While I've
irevcr heard tlierrr do a broadcast.
I‘ve head nothing but favorable
comments about the way they pre-
sent the game." Surrers commented.

For l’ivnick one of his most eni—
barrassing moments as a Dane rui-
nouricer occrrred with Sauers.
