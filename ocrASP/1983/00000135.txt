Pan-Africanism seeks worldwide black unity

By Aileen Brown

 

For the millions of African
peoples scattered about the earth,
Pan-Africanlsm — the unity of
blacks with Africa-may be a way
home. according to Peter Molotsi,
an assistant professor of history and
urban studies at Fordham Universi-
ty. in his lecture here Saturday.

Speaking before a predominantly
black audience. Molotsi told the
crowd of approximately forty peo-

aware of their bodies and health
because of publicity. They wonder
about the food and water."

Hood cited the recent furor over
Dioxins and PCB's as two instances
that have made people tnorc con-
scious of' what they injcst.
However. Hood stated she had
noticed no significant changes in il-
lness trends as a result of the rising
interest it) fitness.

I'lood has also noticed an in-
crease in the incidence of Anorexia
Nervosa. an obsessive urge to diet.
and llulemia. the habit of inducing
vomiting after eating.

“The problems have shown tip in
the last few years. I‘m sure we had
it in the past, but it tnust have been
so rare that it didn't appear to be a
problem. It's cxtrctnely hard to
treat beausc they nevur admit they
ltavc a problem. They kid
themselves." Hood said.

Hood fowardcd her opinion of
the health movement. saying "I
think the American pcuplc in
general are extremists. I think
they'll all pay the penalty or-
thapctlicttlly. We don't know all
there is to know. Until we do. the
best route is all things in modera-
lion."

Hood did agree that students
would feel better if they get ottl and
exercise, adding that some exercise
is better titan none. llowcver. Hood
said. "Fast walking. in my opinion,
is better exercise Ihun jogging.“

However, Hood was not impress-
cd by the fitness craze. “The saute
kids who are concerned with
natural foods are also taking LSD
and alcohol. i find it hard to take
that seriously. Obviously there are
people raised on junk food, and
that’s not right. A well rounded diet
is important, but I can't get too cx—
cited over a fad."

“People are more body cott-
scious." she said. “but whether
they are more health conscious;
that's different."

Delematcr commented on stu-
dent motivations for ﬁtness: “They
go into it for their own personal
reasons. Most want to feel better.
Life is so sedentary that they want
to get up and move. A lot of people
want to appear better. in the pro-
cess they find out that they feel bet-
ter. 1 think the initial reason why
people get into it is not as important
as what they learn in the process."

“It's a combination of getting rid
of tenseness and increasing
cnergy."l3arbcr said. “ People cotnc
10 work out their frustrations.
Many do it to keep their health
above par."

Barber said that most who begin
working out stay with it .and are
quite serious about it, adding “we
have a very high re-sign rate. it's a
way oflife for many here." I J

pic that the history and significance
of Pan-Africanism was “a quest for
identity and homeland by the
dispersed African peoples who were
in the Carribean and in North and
South America."

They knew they were Africans.
said Molotsi. and they desired to
return home —- not necessarily
physically but spiritually. "This."
he said, “is generally referred to as

the great religious or spiritual
revival."
According to Molotsi, Pan-

Africanism was founded by a man
named Henry Sylvester Williams, a
native of Trinadad who was
educated in London around the
turn of the century. Williams’ Pan-
Africun Conference Organization.
said Molotsi. “stood for securing
for Africans around the world true
civil and political rights" as well as
"commemorating the conditions of
our brothers on the continent of
Africa. encouraging our people in
education. industry and enterprise.
and also recognizing the high value
of African sovereignty."

Among the concepts that Pan-
At‘ricanism stresses, said Molotsi.
arc cultural unity; the political in-
dependence of Africa. including the
desire to modernize Africa on the
basis of equality of rights; and the
opposition of racial discrimination.

Pan-Africanism. he stressed. is a
universal phenomenon that takes
different forms according to time.
place and historical settings.

The Pan Africanists. said
Molotosi, “are arrogant due to
their deep conviction that they are
doing the right thing--they are pick-
ing up the fallen. they are pro-
moting the race." This. he said.
formed the basis of his thesis. He
believes that "Pan-Africanism was.

African in nature so it will foster an
understanding of the African
history. culture. and society.” The
universities especially must focus on
kindling national interest in the
youth. They must. he said. "feel the
pulse of the African revolution.”
The second dimension of Pan-
Afrlcanism. continued Molotsl. is
the theological one. African
religion must have the Christian
elements, he said, but also be “dif-

identity and homeland by the

South America. ”

 

.
is and will continue to be relevant
because therc_is nothing better up to
now in black thought." Molotsi's
research ttnd thesis will be printed in
the lilac/t Slur/tar Journal in the
near future.

I’an-Aft'icanism. cotttinued
Molotsi, has several dimensions.
The first of these is that of educa-
tion. liductttion is “seen as a tool of
advancement for black people." ac-
cording Io Molotsi. it is a decisive
influence. and must be “essentially

ferent and unique dttc to our
cultural. geographical. and social
background. The theologist in
Africa secs “African unity as the
unity of spiritual souls."

The filial dimension which
Molotsi discussed was the economic
one. This. he said. included the “in-
dtisuialilatioa of Africa to moder-
ni/c and tap the resources of the
African continent." The key to
economic success in several regions
of Africa is "combining the

resources. raw materials, and
energy which need only to be
harnessed to release Africa from in-
ternational dependence."

Molotsi stressed the importance
of eliminating the conception of
‘Africans described on "animal"
levels. Africans must be allowed to
revive their culture. he said. for
there is "dignity and glory in their
history and cultural affairs." The
Africans. Molotsi pressed. must
propel. promote. and advance their
race. One goal of Pan Africanism is
African sovereignty. Once this is at-
tained. said Molotsi. there must be
a freely elected central council to
assure that all Africans will have the
fundamental rights that all humans
deserve. The political parties will
"be committed to the unity of all
African states. the dignity of
African people and lntlSl cttt across
all sectional ties.”

The essential natttrc of Pan
Africanlsm. said Molotsi, is ex-
pressed by the beliefs of a great
black leader. Frederick Douglass:
“In matters of race. l recognize no
geographical boundaries and no na-
tional limitations. I simply
recognize that a black man
everywhere is entitled to human
rights."

Molotsi's talk was sponsored by
the African Students Association.
