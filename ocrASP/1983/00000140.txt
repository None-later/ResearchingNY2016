Leary and Liddy argue ideas

<Front Page

Did the end justify the means. Liddy was
asked. I

“We won the election!" lte answered.

Leary interjected, "That means it's alright
for you to steal exam papers!" '

Leary's turn on stage comes. and he s
brroyant in his white tennis sneakers. pro-
claiming his mission to protect arid prorrtotc
the individual. his freedom. l'airplay and
justice. tolerance, arid progrcs “The pur-'
pose of the state is to promote llte growth ol
the individual." Leary declared. directly op-
posing Liddy. .

l'le scoffed at John F. Kennedy’s larnous
one-liner."Ask not what your country can do
for you. brrt what you can do for your court-
try." dismissing it as “horseshit.” and "pure
communism."

“What I'm saying is you should tlnrrnh
your nose at the law." This is his rrolion of
"red. white and blue. yaltkec doodle dandy.
America was fotrrrdctl by rcvolutionists,
ruisfils alrd rcbels...cx-crooks and convicts."
ire yelled. Women‘s suffrage. abolition. arid
civil rights were all against the law irt their
time. Ire pointed out. bill are trow basic tenets
of society.

“ l‘ltc police aren‘t going to tell me what to
do in rrry own home with my family." l ctny
said. “We get ltiglr with arty type of drug we
want." Law and order is “urr-Arrrcrictrlt,” he
believes: he favors basic “itrstice arid fair
play.“ He is quick to point out that he
doesn't frrvorr r4 chy. but finds that “nine
out of ten laws are abused by the state to take
away the freedom of the indiridunl."

I.iddy had a rebuttal for this: "Well. l find
rritrc of the Ten t‘orntrraudrnents trrir. l'.\ct‘|tl
for the otre about covclirrg yoru neighbor's
wife. I like to do that."

()n LSD and other hallrrciuogerrs, "‘I in-
goal is individual growth." said Leary. an ad-
rrrittcd conuissuer of psychedelic drrrgs.
“liack in the mods. rrry colleagues and l
dcrrrotrstrated that LSD. rncscalinc, atrd pol
can increase your intelligence‘. raise yotrr con»
scionsucss. and give you a broader perspec-
live." he said to great applause.

Liddy had rtothllrg to say on the topic we
ccpl that "if l ever calrglrt ally of my three
sons with dope l‘d lrrrvc my foot so far up his

 

 

 

ass it'd take six FBI men to pull it out."

Back in I965. during the boom of the drug-
culturc. Leary recommended to the federal
government that they regulate. but not it-
legalize. drugs. He predicted an underworld
drug business which “would make the pro-
hibition days look like a tea party."

Still today. he favors licensing people 1.,
buy Jlttgs. equating a car license to a "tttttri.
jutt'ttt license" and an airplane license to an
"LSD license." He suggested written tests
testing knowledge of tile drug's effects. and
an "under the influence“ test to guer
tolerance.

SA ’5 budgetcommittee coordinates cash flow

 

By Heidi Gralla '

Krill": ll‘RIIEIl

How do six SUNYA students

-deal with half a million dollars?

SA'S budget committee. compris-
ed of six members appointed by SA
President Mike Corso. is currently
appropriating over $500,000 —— the
projected I983~tt4 sludcrrr activity
revenue — to finance more than 80
SA funded groups. according to SA
Controller Dave Selmcyman.

The large strut of money does not
scent to phase committee members.
"I don‘t think it's the .s . in dollar
amount of motley; | tlrrrrk it’s the
fact that it’s tire students’ money
that makes it so awesome." ex-
plained committee member
Hamilton South.

Committee Chair Johanna Sar-
racco added "Right now we're
looking at it (the budget) per group.
When we're dorlc. then i think the
arnorrrrt is going to hit us."

Earlier this sctttcs‘lcr. explained
Sarracco, groups were glvcrr a three
week period to submit a funding re-
quest to the btrdgct committee. in
date. approximately tit) groups have
applied for frrrrdirrg.

All applications are reviewed by
the budget Committee. said Sarrac-

tip a bit," he said.

Reilly questioned McKinlcy‘s
rrrcntiorr of other ttrriorrs. pointing
out that these were all unions in
pr'ivalc industry. In private in~
dustty. he c\plrrinctl.thc crrrployccs
ol'tcn lrrnc "escalator clauses,"
which allow for salary increases to
keep up wi'h inflation. "We don‘t
tune that t w'trlalor clansei." Rcilly
said, “We lurxc now gained sortie
ground. It would defeat the ptrtposc
of L'ttllL't'llH' bargaining to gi\c it
back.“ he said.

McKinley, for llt'l part. stressed
that her proposal was not ucccssrn i~
ly il solution. brrt one possibilrty.
and added sltc \\tts sttrc that others
in the rrrriorr had thought of it.

Reilly said that {\chitrlcy‘s idea
had been lllL‘Ll before at other
ntti\ersitics with little success. He
cited \\'n_vnc State University irr
l)ctroit as one csarrrple. the result
being not only a cut in wages. brrt
also an increase in layoffs.

According to Reilly. lltJl’ has its
own proposal to save university
iobs and lttlsc tCH‘IltlL‘. ’l'he trrriorr
has proposed a temporary sur-
charge on personal irrcorrrc tax.
similar to the onc rrscd to bail New
York (‘ity out of its financial trou—
blc a few _\cars ago. The surcharge.
Reilly said. would only arrronrlt to a
couple of dollars a week.

“I'll pay a corrple bricks a week
to keep this university strong." he
said. “The ttrriorr has to fight for
wlral isjnsl for its people. Politics is
a tough garlic. and yo plav it hard.
The easy way is layo 's. We‘re lr'Y'
irrg to show Cuomo that he‘ll rttirr rr
marvelous university if it's ‘douc
that way." he said.

Reilly said concessions to the
State have already been made. On
lieb. 23. he said. the trtriorr agreed
to hold two weeks pay which would
rrol go to employees until they iti-
dividtnrlly left state ertrployrttcrrt.
The trrriorr also agreed to cost corr-
tairrrtrcrlt in health insurance. New
crrrployccs ilL‘t‘th their sick and
vacation leave at a slower rate than
employees of six years or more.
Reilly added. "in previous corr-
tr'acls we lnrd times with deferred
rtttscs for two years. We earned it
but didn't take it. The state had use
of the money." Ire asserted.

McKinley admitted tlrtrt her idea
may trot be feasible. but it was one
possibility she wished the ur'iotr
membership to consider. I |

 

 

 

 

co. Often. a member of the com-
mittee will meet with a represen-
tative from the group to discuss the
group‘s budget proposal. Addi-
tionally. committee members cont-
pare price estimates supplied by the
group with outside estimates.

The'committcc members. assisted
by Sehncyman, then make any
necessary revisions and the budget
is voted orl by the committee. Sar-
racco noted that the committee has
made mostly rrrinor revisions in the
22 budgets they have reviewed so
far.

When the corrtrnittcc finishes
reviewing all budgets. which Sarrac-
co hopes to have done by March 25.
the entire budget is passed on to the
SA President.

The president can make any
changes he feels are necessary.
However. Corso said he would not
make changes without contacting
the members of any group whose
budget he changes. Adding that lie
does anticipate nraking sorrre
changes in budget conrrrrittce's pro-
posal. Corso explained. "I don‘t
want to irrterrrrpr the budget corri-
rrritrec. llopet'ully with my guidance
to thenr.. and their their guidance to
me. we can eorrre up with a good
budget."

Corso tllcn proposes his version
of the budget to Central Council.
Council Spends several nights
reviewing the budget, and during
this time groups can appeal to
Council if they are dissatisfied with
their budget.

After the entire budget has been
reviewed. Council votes on it as a
whole. Then the budget goes brick
to the SA President to be signed.

According to Council Chair Jeff
Fromm. the president's and court-
cils lcrrn of office cannot cnd urtlil
after the budget has been passed
and signed.

Corso contends that right now
council members do not fully
urrderslarrd the budgetary process.
State Quad representative .lel'l'
Schneider agreed with this. adding
that “more than half (of council)
doesn't know how the budget pro-
cess works."

State Quad representative Sir/y
Auletta. who serves on Council's
finance committee and brrdgct com»
rrriltce said it took her "a long
time“ to understand SA's finances
and she doesn't think rrrost oft
(‘ouncil understands everything
budget committee docs.

Aulcrta were optimistic that by the
time the btrdgcl comes to Council.
members will be more informed.

Sarraeeo said she plans to put
together a packet for Council
members, explaining the budgetary
process. in addition. she pointed
out that nrinrrtes from all budget
committee meetings are posted irt
the SA office and that a rationale
for each budget is included in the
mimttes.

According to Schneyman. the
$6.50 increase per student per
semester. which students voted to
impose. will provitle the budget
committee with approxirmrtely
$80,000 trtore than last year. to ap-
propriate SA groups.

Corso said that this increase
would pay for sorrre additional pro-
grarns. brtt mostly “the irrcr‘ased
frrrrds will be going to keep existing
programs alive. A lot of the money
is needed just to keep things at lltc
status quo.” he said.

Sarracco noted that Vt‘ll.
W(‘l)ll. and Speakers liortnrl. are
among the groups receiving the
highest appropritrtiorrs.

Wt‘l)li (ictreral Manager Rich
I’rartcoliui said W('l)l5 hard rc-
qncsted an appropriation of
5434.800. explaining that most of

 

.Canadian is

their expenses came from engineer-
ing and equipment. He added that
he had spoken to Sarracco and went
through the budget “line by line"
with her. Budget committee will
review WCDB's budget on Satur-

ay.

Corso said the qualities he looked
for when choosing budget commit-
tee members were mostly time and
interest. although an accounting of
financial background was also
helpful.

Schncyman said he and Corso in-
lcrviewcd l5-20 applicants before
choosing nine to serve on the corn-
rnitlee. Since then two members
have resigned because they couldn't
.rttakc the tlnre commitment.

Sarracco said Mark (iricb. the
third person to resign, did so
because he disagreed with test or
the committee on the purposes or
btrdgct corrrrrritlcc.

(iricb contends he was "kickc
oil" the committee. "I was askirr
too many questions about polic_\
There's no policy about who get
funded.“

the six students currently setting
on the committee are Johanna S ‘
tacco, chair. David l’lttlslls' . "
chair. Steve Ahearrt. Sir/y Aulctla.
Ira l~'rorne. and llaruiltorr South.
