A common goal

To the Editor:

Thanks to an article in the ASP about tltc speech at
SUNYA of Professor Mohammcd Yadigary (ASP. March
4. I983. pg.3). students on this campus should now have a
much greater understanding of tire aspirations of the
Islamic world. Speciﬁcally. it is the common goal of Arab
and other Moslcm countries to eliminate lsmcl. the Jewish
state.

Professor Yadigary's call for Maslcms to “liberate
lsrttcl“ echoes the thoughts and words of Moslem and Arab
leaders of the lust thirty-five years. More importantly. it
highlights the fact that the demand of these leaders for
another "Palestinian" Arab country (the first ottc is Jor-
dan) has been and continues to be nothing more than a ploy
to ftrrthcr the cause of Israel‘s destruction. What bothers
these Arab leaders is not the conditions of their "Palesti-
nirui" Arab brothers. because if that was the case. they
would stop keeping tltcin in squalid refugee camps fit their
own country. and stop scnding them off to die in hopeless
wars against lsracl. What rcallg bothers the Arab lcildL‘l‘S is
the stimc thing that bothered Nazi leaders; thc .lcws iti Ilicir
illltlsl. This attitude is cvcrtiplificd by the statement on
Ilridio Amman (Jordan) irt 1970 that "Israel‘s existence in
the ltcttrt oi' the Arttb people is an absurdity and ought to hc
got rid of by any means whatsoever." This “rcligious”
ch-hrurcd was repeated more recently by King lltisscirt oi
.ltirdtlll. ill the lsltiiitic Conference in 1980. 11c stlld “The
Islamic tuition and just liclicvcrs will not ticccpt lltc situat-
tiurr ut' the llllltl of the Prophet's Iliglit to liczivcn..,bcing
criptivc ot' Zionist occupation.“

ll' AlllL‘l‘lL’tlIl collch- students arc going to discuss the
Arab-Israeli conflict. and hopefully thus join iii lllL' workl-
widc effort to promote pcticc in tire Middle litist. it is vitiil
(11111 Hwy tit lcrist understand tltc tirisic motives tutti llllL'lt-
lions of thc prirtics involved. Without knowing Wlllll Ilic
problems tire. discussions of their solutions are futile. it is
rriy sillccl‘t.‘ hopc Ilurl students on this ctinipus. and people
cvcrywlicrc will take ti little time to learn at least some ot'
the Irutlt about this crucial issue.

To the Editor:

1 would like In Irikc this opportunity to address the stu-
tlctir population of SUNYA concerning the ASP cdituriril
on the actions of tire Revisionisl Zionist Altcrrititivc (RZA)
during World Culture chk.

Firstly. you rightly expressed the notion that the week's
events L‘iillL‘Clll ii “celebration of cultural diversity." but
you failed to cxplrtin how 11 Star of Drivid. ti .lt:\\'1\ll
religious wrrtliol found in every xyrtouotiuc. dripping in

ctlitur'irtl continued to sltlte tluu “Ilic wltulc idcii llCllllKl
World chk (is) ticccntuuting the positive ritrlurc ol' llli.’
university's diversity." lritlccd. this “pitsilivc diversity" is
one of the outstanding features of this school; liowcvcr.
uric should not misconstruc this to include the right of any
one group to blatantly rilttick the religious cultur‘c of
another group.

Secondly. to use the words of Ilic ,-ISI’: "ignorance oi"
other pcoplc'\ traditions leads to mlsuntlct'sltuidiug of
other people's intentions.“ ‘l‘ltc ignorance 111 this instance
lies not with itZA but with the tilllllut‘ 0f the editorial who
ignores the traditions of Arab Blood Fcuds. (witness
Lebanon's (‘ivil Writ.) and Arab intentions concerning tltc
Jewish State. (sec 11.4. ASP. Mill‘L‘ll 4. “Professor (‘ttlls on
Moslcms to Illicitrtc lsi'ttcl.)

'l‘llirdly. Ilic .AISI’ claims that it group of students from
tlic RZA "just ttt'cn't rctidy l'ordivcrslry" ltL'CilllSt: llicy tore
down “at culturril display by sortie Ar'ttb students during
World chk lillinic lilock l’nrty." \‘tht the RZA ix not
ready for is Anti-Jewish propaganda to be hung on this
campus without adequate r'csporisc. itlltl besides. Ilic central
question still remains: Itow is a picture of Mcruicltcm llcgin
ethnically Arab'.’

i’ourtlily. lllL‘.‘1SI’Clilllll$ that tile poster can itt surnc way
be intcrprctcd as something other than Anti-Jewish. This is
rctttiuisccrtt of clttiuis by other “sti-ctillcd impartial
observers" of s\\'il\lil<ith hung iii (icrnuuiy during the
1930's.

1-"it'tlily. the editorial ignores the fact tliut World chk

and may 1 add stupid. manner are not protected.

Lastly. the ASP said the RZA action was “inap-
propriate” and equaled the group with “vigilantcs.” This
indefensible point hardly dcscrvcs comment. However. as
the ASP feels it must slander the RZA. i feel compelled to
comment. RZA acted in the only appropriate manner opcn-
:d to it. There was ti request made to have the poster taken
down. and it was ignored. The University authorities clear-
ly displayed their indifference to the circumstances by
allowing the poster to be hung in the first place. When a
particular University official was approached to have it
removed. he said he would not remove it and would also
allow swusilkas to bc displayed as culture. Titc RZA (11 no
time resorted to violence. as vigilttntcs tire known to do.
And wttcn responsible University officials finally arrived.
the RZA grrvc its full cooperation ii' alleviating the situa-
tion. , i

it will be a sud day in lllt‘ history of this University when
it tltc riiunc of "culture" one group will be riblc to dcl‘runc'
