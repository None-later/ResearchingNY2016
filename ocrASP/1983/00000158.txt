SUNYA devising ways to attract minority students

private schools al‘ter ﬁnancial aid than it costs to at-
tend SUNYA. He feels the admissions office doesn't
explain this Well enough to potential students.

But the university has just established a system of
providing personalized information to minority ap-
plicants. These students will be supplying information
and answering questions on both academic and non-
academic concerns.

The Admissions Office. Hart added, will also be
sending mailings with information on a variety of pro-
grams and services.

“We’re trying to give students a great deal of atten-
tion. to respond to their information needs." said
Hart.

Additionally. Martin said. "There are certain
groups helping students to get irtto colleges. working
with them on the application process. We're going to
try to make admissions and these groups aware of each
other."

Hurt explained there were several problems limiting
minority enrollment in the past, not the least of “hich
was identifying ripplicattls' ethnic origin. While
students had the option of stating their race on enroll—
ment forms, there was no such question on the SUNY-
wide application forms before this past fall.

Associate Vice Chancellor for [Educational Services
Dr. J. Norman l'loslellct. working out of SUNY ('err
lrrtl Administration, said' while tlte federal Office of
Civil Rights had asked that tlreoptiorral ethnicity quev
lion be added to application forms in l‘)77 or W78, it
took until last year for the idea to \\Uli\ its nay
through various academic committees to the vice
chancellor for approval. ‘

“The basic rationale thclrind including the optional

question) is to try to keep records of minority students
applying to the university system." Hostelter said.

“We became sensitive to the need for it when we
were thinking of evaluating admissions related to
minorities." Hostetter continued. “One of the things
we're trying to do is attract and hold minority
students. This at least will give us statistics to form a
base and we can work from that base."

Hart also hopes to use this information on the
SUNYA campus "to redtrce under-rcpr Minn of

certain groups, especially Blacks. Hispanics and
Native Americans."

l-lart explained that admissions is constantly review-
ing its own enrollment process. evaluating who is ad-
mitted and whether certain groups are under-
represented in their relationship to the population of
New York State.

“We tend to change our focus over time. and ad-
dress different groups." llart said. “We hope to cover
everyone in time."

Huck said, while he feels the number of minority
students enrolled on campus will increase steadily if
SUNYA continues with its present efforts, it is dif-
ficult to make changes in a large institution.

“lly virtue of its very existence. organi/ations are
normally conservative." littck explained. “tl’rcsidenti
()‘lcury has been fantastic in pushing; he has definite-
ly displayed his commiltrncnt. lint it is a difficult deal
pushing it down through the otgarri/rttiort, What really
happens is 'litrsincss almost as usual'."

Buck said the university‘s commitment to increasing

minorin enrollment on cttlttptls will proic itself itt the

"You put )our money “here )our priorities are."
