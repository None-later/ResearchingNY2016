Indoor trackmen take’third at Union Invitational.

By Tom Kacandes
.\'T»ll’l" WRITER

Tltc Albany State men’s indoor
track team took third place at the
Union Invitational last Saturday.
Tltc top five teams were: Cortland
with 138 points, University of
Rochester with 104. Albany State
with 62 points. RPI with 56. and
Colgate with 54. Twenty-three
tcams competed in all.

It was a breakthrough meet for
the Danes in many ways. All three
of Albany's relay teams ran season-
best times. two school records were
set. and several individuals came
through in the cltrtch rather unex-
pcctedly.

Conspicuous among these was
sophomore Noel Woodburn. who
ran a very gutsy leg of the 4 x 800
meter relay. “is split of l:58.3 was
the fastest Albany time all season
until he later ran l:5li.l in the open
BOO-meter run taking third. Wood-
burrr, a transfcr from CW Post, has

mark on the line against Division I
rival Iloston University. The Tcrr-
ricrs were looking to pay back the
Danes for Albany‘s victory irt llrc
Great Dane Classic ovcr lioston.
An added inccntivc was a numbcr
of local rivalrics bctwcctt wrestlers
on both squads.

Thc Dunes maintained their
uudcfctttcd record as they posted it
one point. 21.20 will over the Tcr~
ricr‘s. Senior L‘O-L‘ilplillll Vic Ilcrmtm
sccurcd lltc victory by defeating
highly rcgardcd Davc Koplovit/ in
the final match of tire meet. l'lcr-
mart had previously lost to
Koplovitz in the finals of tire (‘rrcut

the Danes streak didn’t. Albany
traveled to Florida to compete iii
the Sunshine Open at the University
of Central Florida. Three Dane
wrestlers placed in tire top six in this
tournament composed mainly of
Division 1 wrestlers. While in
Florida. Albany faced two teams in
dual meets. They defeated Central
Florida and then suffered their first

the middle-distance events.

Another clutch performance
came in the 500-metcr run. It was a
critical point in the meet: Albany
trailed Division I Colgate by two
points. Sophomore Thad Wyntcr
rose to the occasion by taking
fourth place with a time of 1:08.}.
his best time by two seconds.
Freshman Tony Rizzo took sixth in
the event. Then Bruce Van Tassel
came front behind in the 50-mcter
high hurdles to take second irr 7.2
seconds. Sophomore Mike Riggins
took fifth in the 50-mctcr dash and
Woodburn followed with his third
in the 800 to put Albany ahead for
good.

That was the drama. but it was
llrc quiet work itt tltc field events
that had set the scene. Sophomore
Marc Mcrctlrio's toss of 14.94
ntctcrs in the JS-pouud \vcight
throw broke his own school record
for tire fifth time this scttson. He
placed second overall. Bill anon
showed a rcturn to form throwing
15.00 mctcrs in the shot put to take

third place.
