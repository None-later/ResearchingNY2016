Alter experiencing this awareness. we
begin to learn ways with which to meet
these needs. Exhibiting this awareness is
_what Telethon is all about. It is an annual
SUNYA student event raising money to
benefit local organizations. Yes. college
students do care and are willing to pitch In.
When we go for It. we go all the way!
Albany has the largest student run telethon
in the country.

compliments her spontaneous counter
part. They are quite a pair: both admitting
they would be nowhere without the other.
Along with a staff of 45. the chairs selected
three area organizations to be the
beneficiaries of their efforts. The decision
was difficult. one which entailed soliciting
organizations. and conducting a lengthy
selection process with the entire staff.

In past years, the orgainzations chosen
needed Telethon's money to survive. This
year. however,.the staff did not find any
group in that position. The funds of the
event will be used for “special programs."
They will provide the children with other

Upon first glance they appear to be like
any other kids. but these are “special
children with special dreams." Perhaps the

 

facets besides studying; "some fun stuff." .

 

    

biggest problems for most of us are
mldterms. a date for Friday night, or a
hangover Sunday morning; for these kids.
some of the tasks we find commonplace
can prove almost Impossible. Actions and
experiences we may take for granted are
non-existant for many of these kids.

This year's recipients are the Wildwood
School. the Neurofibromatosis Founda-
tion. and Camp Opportunities, Inc. The
money will be divided among the groups
60-20-20 percent respectively

Wildwood, located in Schenectady. is a
school that serves children. 3-21 years old.
with combinations of handicapped condi-
tions: neurological disorders. emotional
disturbances. learning disabilities. speech
and language problems. autism. and
seizure disorders,

The funds Wildwood receives will be us-
ed to develop an after-school recreation
program. in an attempt to bring the kids In-
to the mainstream. It will provide these
children with alternatives to occupy their
leisure time.

Kozin explained that Wildwood was a
“sentimental favorite" with the staff this
year. as the money has been given to the
school on various occasions In the past.

She added that the New York Nor-
theastern Chapter of Neurofibromatosls
Foundation (Von Rickllnghausen's
Disease). was chosen because It “touched
us." This organization had a valid need for
the money: to put together pamphlets for
parents and kids explaining the disease and
Its affects.

Neuroflbrornatosls is a disorder of the
nervous system by which tumors can form
on the nerves anywhere in the body at any
time throughout the Individual's life span. it
is a progressive. complex disorder which Is

more. It is linked to learning disabilities.
epilepsy. mental retardation. cancer and it
can cause disfigurement. It has no known
cure or effective treatment other than
surgery on the tumors (which may grow
back and can cause early death. as was the
case of Joseph Merrick. in the movie “The

Elephant Man").

The third recipient Is Camp Oppor-
tunities. lnc.. of Albany. lt attempts to
assist with the problems of juvenile delin-
quency. prevention and rehabilitation.
while upgrading the quality of family living
and Improving the youth's general
character. The organization provides day
camp activities In addition to a year-round
operation serving not ony Inner-city
youths. but also children from the country,
senior citizens and the handicapped. The
camp facilities are used year round for out:
door education. recreation. and con-
ferences conducted by various groups in
the community.

C np Opportunities will utilize their
funds to include more kids In their pro-
gram. purchase additional buses. and
bolster existing programs. The chairs ex
plained that this organization was chosen to
provide underpriviledged kids with the
camp experience that many of us were for
tunate enough to have.

Telethon. is trying to help people outside
the university who are less fortunate than
us. To do this. the group has been active all
year In fundraising. and working with the
children of the selected organizations, The
various fundraistng functions included:
Run for the Gold. Dance Marathon. Le Fat
Cat Night. Afternoon at the Bars. T-Shlrt
and hat sales. along with numerous other
fundraisers.

Last year's Telethon grossed over
$46,000. Both co-chairs would like to sur<
pass that sum. as Is traditional. However.
Kozin explained that any money raised
tonight will be helpful to the organizations.
but feared that the currently weak
economy may still take its toll. Helping
others and the smiles on the kids' faces will
be the biggest payoff, admitted Kwasman.

in a few hours. the year-long efforts.
planning and organization for tonight will
culminate in a 24-hour Telethon. It will

classmates entertain us with talents we
never knew they possessed. The beer will
be flowing and food distributed as every
"Twiggy" feasts on a Chipwich. (Before last
year's Telethon. i never even knew what a
Chipwich was). Collection buckets will be
passed around as all present feel a “special
something" this night.

For a few hours. maybe more. students
will forsake whatever they had planned.
turning out en masse to pack the Campus
Center Ballroom, Some will be present to
see just what all the "hype" has been about
— why all those videos have been playing In
the CC. lobby. and why all those people
have been trying to get us to buy
something. Others know; they are there
every year.

This is a university event. one which
everyone can appreciate. And every year
we are packed In the ballroom to
demonstrate. This Is one activity where the
students. for one weekend. truly come
together. which helps the university
become accepted and appreciated within
the community. It cannot be done without
everyone's help. Telethon is what It is
because of a staff of 47. Advisor Scott
Birge. ECC members. local businesses. the
student body. and numerous others.
Eileen expressed it best. “I think Telethon
24 hours a day."

All week. the staff ran around like
chickens without heads, If they thought
they could make money on something. it
was sold. It is hard to believe this is
Telethon weekend already.

Regardless of whether or not last years
total Is broken. Telethon '83 will be a suc-
cess. The money raised will be contributed
to make the lives of some children better.

When making plans for tonight.
remember h'ow special this night is. and
that It is an annual event. Before heading
downtown. stop in for a while. bid during
the auction. grab a bite to eat. be entertain-
ed. and have a good time. Hey. while you
are there. think of the kids. dig deep down
into your pockets and put some money in
the buckets. And give. give 'tiI It hurts. [LI
