Federal budg"

<5

Slate's 1983 budget considerablyi
exceeds the federal cuts. and must
be attributed ntorc to the recession
titan the reductions in federal aid.

And since the state passed some
of tile federal reductions down to
the local governments, the state did
not "bear its ftlll burden," they
said. For this reason slate employ’
ment cuts due to federal changes
were not extensive.

The federal budget cuts came at a
time when the state could not
replace the funds. the professors
said. Compensation for tire federal
cuts by the state would have revers-
ed the cconotnic revitalization
policy of the slate —— to increase aid
to local governments while at the
saute titnc reducing selected tax
rates to try to Ittrc business itllo tile
state —— by requiring increased tax
rates.

The major exception. they cited.
was the state‘s decision to help two
groups made ineligible for AFCD.
tturttcly women tltrcc to six tnonths
pregnant with their first cltlld nttd
students bclwcctt Ill and 21.

These two groups. according to
the study. were picked up by Home
Relief, :1 program funded by lltc
slate and its localities. The state ttttd
sorttc localities protected sotnc of Its
ncedicst residents from lhc impact
of tire federal cttts by funding cer-
tain mandated services with trott-
l‘cdcral sources of revenue. lltc
study poitttcd out.

The study says lllc Reagan ad-
ministration‘s policy of
dcrcgulating has done little to
reduce uttrcgulatory activity by the
state.

Lurie said she did ttot know if the
federal govcrttntent Itad an intett~
lion to get the state to reduce
regulatory activity or not. since that
was the weakest part of their study,
and not many people had anything
to say about it.

New York. according to tile
study, enforces tttost regulations
because the state's cill/ens support
them. not because of federal re-

stances “New York was a model for
the rest 'of the nation during the
years of increasing federal regula-
tion." Several state administrators
argued that the degree of federal
deregulation has been exaggerated.
it said.

The fiscal effects of the FFY I982
budget cuts. were. on; tile whole|
overestimated by local govern-
ments; the professors said. Non-
profit agenicies were effected more
severely than governmental agen-

cies. The non-profit agencies were '

affected by cuts itt programs and
delayed payment for their services
from the courtly government.

Cuts itl CEI‘A artd Suclal Ser:
vices funds were most directly felt
by the non-profit agencies. ttnd
lltcsc cttts forced reductions in staff
and services. they said. The ctlts
also stimulated Inorc efficient agen-
cy operations, crcutivc strategies for
raising funds. and new emphasis on
long term pltutttittg. according to
the rcporl. The local llltll‘pl’Ol'IIS'
casit flow problems were traced to
delays lltc county had in receiving
federal Social Service funds which
are channelled through the state
government. Matty non-profit
agencies. which were last stage in
the series of delays, were forced to
borrow funds to cover their revenue
shortfalls, the study sttld. [But
“despite the cuts attd lltc cash-ﬂow
problems. however. no agencies
went out of business."

“Public attd private sector
cooperation was stimulated." the
study said. The United Way started
a special emergency fund attd also

   
 
   
   
    
   
     
 
      
     
 

worked with'tlte county government
to lessen' cutbacks. the study also
noted“ 5

"Contrary to the I'ears;of many
state and, local officials” 'lthat ‘the

~ roof would fall in' after passage of

the I981 federal budget cuts. the cf-
fecls were complex. subtle and
muted during the first year." the
report concluded. But it also pro-
jccted that the effects in New York
State will be more dramatic in FliY

‘ I983. The changes are expected to

be felt irt llte housing and health
policy areas. In local ,capital pro-
gram choices. and in state/local
relations.

Lurle and Llebschutr also claim
that rcductiorts in‘state employment
was minimal in FI-‘Y 1982 in all
departments except tltc Department
of L'ttbor in FFY 1983 as a result of
cuts in federal aid, and that the im-
pact will be greatcst in the State
Education Department.

Thcsc cuts. ltowcvcr. will be
stnull relative layoffs due to tile
recession and tire consequent short-
i‘ttll itt state tax revenues.

There will also be less federal
housing funds available as up-
poittlcd federal funds for housing
unit rehabilitation and construction
are lessened and not replaced. the
report said.

Efforts to develop stronger cost
contuituttent and fraud/abuse
recovery programs. including possi-
ble rcdcfinilions of Medicaid
eligibility cart be expected because
ol‘ the federal cuts and rapidly rising
health care costs, particularly for
long-term cttrc under Medicaid.
