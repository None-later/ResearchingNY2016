Stickmen look strong for up

 

By Mark Levine

If,” TOR/1| I. II \SIA I." All

When asked to make a pre-season
prediction about how well they ex-
pect their team to perform in the
upcoming season. most coaches will
be somewhat reluctant to go out on
a limb and boldly say that they have
high hopes for success. HoWever.
tread coach Mike Motta does not
scent _ apprehensive when asked
ltow he foresees his Aibarty State
varsity lacrosse team's I983 carn-
paign.

“I think this is the best team I've
had since l‘ve been here." said
Motta. wlto is beginning his seventh
year as head coach.

Motta seems to have good reason
to be optimistic. as ltc will field a
team that has depth at virtually
every position and has four key
players relrrrnirtg from last year's
6-7 squad tltal finished third in the

SUNY Conference and failed to
qualify for the playoffs.

Heading the list is 2nd Team All-
Conference attacker Don
Casadonte. who led the learn in
scoring last year as a sophomore.
Junior midfielder Jon Reilly and
senior dcfenseman Bill Watson also
represented Albany on the 2nd
Team Ali-Conference unit last year.
Watson is returning for his fourth
year as a varsity starter.

Motla sees depth as one of iris
lcttttt's biggest assets. "We have a
deep. solid midfield and are fortr
deep at attack. llut we do have a
few standouts at each position-that
we can't afford to lose." he said.

One of these standouts is
sophomore goaltender Alan ('orn—
field. Asa freshman last year ('orrr-
field finished rtitrtlr ill the country to
save pct‘cctttagc. arttl this is one alert
where Albany can‘t rely on depth.
“Alan is an orrtslartding goalie.er

lie is really the only goalie we have.
This is one position where we have
to depend on only one person.“
Motla noted.

Motla is presently preparing his
learn fora long journey to Virginia,
where they will open their season
against Randolph Macon. Aside
from that tile schedule is virtually
lite same as last year. according to
Mona. Along with conference
rivals Cortland. (icttcsco. ()swcgo,

as hell as local rivals RI’I. Sienu.
Union and Skidmore. who will be
Albany's opponent lit the home
opener April 2.

With depth and talent at every
position Motta anticipates a season
full of promise. when asked if he
thought his teattr \lttllltl irnprmc
met last year‘s (1-7 record. he em-
phatically replied. “Deﬁnitely.”

it was four years ago when
Albany State Ittctt's rcrrrtis head
coach llob Lewis and his recruiting
staff were able to coax four high
school tennis players to bring their
racquets to Albany. it is by no coin-
eidence that the tennis learn has
dominated collegiate tennis at the
SUNY level during that span. winn—

“Sure l'rn disappointed that this
upcoming season will be my last

“We‘ve become such a closely krill

“i'm looking forward to
graduating but naturally l'rrr disrr
poittted to be going tip my cottt-
pclitivc tennis career." said I c\irtc.
wltosc career tccord is 57-33.
“We've all ltad ltttll really good

to just scpct‘tttc and leave. 1 don‘t

and his recruiting staff to try to
replace us."

Don't think Lewis isn‘t a bit wor-

"Sure. I'm concerned about next
year." said Lewis. who is in his
twelfth year as tennis coaclt.
"We‘ve contacted a lot of good
prospects btrt we haven‘t heard arty
final decisions. My rnairt concern
now is getting prepared for this tip-

The Danes, who are coming off a
5-3 fall record itt dual meets, will
look to improve that mark this spr»

“()ttt' rrrairt goal in the fall was to
