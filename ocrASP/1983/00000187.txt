Parking complaints continue; so do the tickets

By Suzanne Ahels
.HAII HRH/IR

Nobody wants to come out to
tlteir car and find a yellow parking
ticket stuck rnrder the windshield
wiper. bttt everyone wants to park
as close as tltey can to tile porlirrm.

Lack of parking facilities is a irra-
jor complaint on tlte SUNYA cartr-
pus. Over the last five years apptos-
itnalcly 34.000 parking tickets have
beetr issued by the Department ol
Public Safety.

Lloyd llcbctt. Director of the
Traffic Division of the university's
Department ol‘ Public Safety said.
“We write abottt 5.000 tickets over
tlte summer and abortt |S.t)t)t) a
semester. All of these are for park-
ing iii the wrong places or not being
registered."

According to llcbcrt. the reason
for the great ttrrrtrbcr of tickets is
ltt/ittess. “Student; are either too
lazy to park in the student lots. or
are late to class." He added tltat
“there are plenty of signs." so ig-
ttorartcc ot' the parking regulations
is not a valid reason for the high
number of violators. “Matty people
just take a chance and ltope not to
get caught." he said.

"('lose spots (treat the podirrtn
trnd itt front of eaclt Quad) are for
those with medical reasons or oc-
cupational reasons." explained
llebert. Special pctntits are issttctl
to those who for it number of
reasons “need direct and close ric-
eess to their cars." he added.

Many students corrtplairt that
there is not enough parking. btrt
llebert said “the two big lots near
Dutch and State are scldorrt l'trll.“

l-lcrbert did admit tltat the ('ol-
otrial and Indian Qirad lots are
small. brtt that "it‘s partly because
there are woods around them. and
the rtrrivcrsity built these while
Dutch ttttd Stale lots were btrilt by
the state.

ltt addition to the tour Quad lots
there are two Monthly l’ay lots
outside of Dutch and ('olonial

Quads. llcbctt said, which run on a
first-come. first-serve basis. The
Visitor's tot. located between the
circle trttd State Quad. is asailablc
to anyone for parking drtting the
week for art hourly fee.

At night attd on weekends. said
llcbcrt. tlte parking regulations are
tnore lenient. Students with
registered cats cart park itt special
permit areas after 4ti) p.rn.. iii the
Visitor‘s lot after 3:3“). and in the
tnontlrly lots after 4:30 lel. on
weekdays. All ot tltesc lots are
utttcstticted on Saturday and Sun-
day. he said.

.l.M. t'anto. an ofﬁcer at tile
Department of Public Safety. said
ltis olticc ltas isstrcd approximately
It.le facility—staff. and about 7.962
strttlcttt registration decals. ” there
is always someplace to park." he
said. but added that on “(‘olottial
it‘s tough to ﬁnd a spot."

A parking ticket. Ilcbert said. is
$5 for a registered car and art addi-
tiotral SJ fine is arldcd for
unregistered cars.

"Once we krtow who the strident
is who ltas failed to pay a traffic
fine. a hold is ptrt on their records.“
llcbct't esplaincd. Once a lrrrld is
pill on one's records. a strrdcttt is
denied "registration. pre-
r'cgistrtrtion. transcripts or
diplomas." lte said.

Many students. however. find it
ttttfair and inconviettcnt to have to
park far away from the podium.
One student. also a university
employee. who declined to be iden-
tified. said site comes itt dtrtittg tltc
day and ltas to observe daytittte
rules. brrt doesn't get a chance to
leave rrrrtil late at night. "I don‘t
appreciate inning to go ottt to Ilrc
boottics of Dutch Quad late at
night." she said.

Several other sltrdcnts complain-
ed that at night the continuing
students fill rrp all the lots close to
the podium. and that it's a poten-
tially dangerous situation to walk itt
tltc lots late at night.
