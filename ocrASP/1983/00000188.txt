the council added a sL‘tllL‘Iicc to

y 'l he nominations deadline for the

SUNY winning enrollment fight

Higher Education conducts a na-
tional survey of admissions trends.
This year. the survey reveals that
tltc number of freshman applica-
tions at private colleges is 7 percent
higher than this time last year. wirilc
public school applications have
decreased by 8 percent.

However. the impact of this in.
formation is less considerable when
viewed in light of the Chronicle's
survey of enrollment trends. and
statewide estimates of enrollment in
1982.

A November I982 report to the
New York State Commissioner of
Education and the Board of
Regents by the State Education
Department revealed that enroll-
ment at private colleges in New
York State actually declined 2.2
percent fora loss of 9.220 students.
State University schools reported a
.I percent drop in enrollment in
1932. or a loss of 385 students.

This change is slight considering
that SUNYA intentionally reduced
their targeted enrollment for t982
from 2.200 to 1,950 to alleviate the
swelled university population. For
the i983 school year the targeted
enrollrneril is back tip to 2.200. ac-
cording to the state report.

The Chronicle did. however.
state later in its report that private
colleges nationwide suffered a 3.85
perceril drop irt enrollment corti—
pared to 1932 figures. while the tra-
lion's public four—year institutions
reported a decline of only .7 per-

an. inn. It.."’"brain.”a

llowcier. Phillips later corri-
plairicd. “I don‘t feel there's been
sufficient ad\eltiscniettl. i feel the
change (to open elections) was
riiadc witlt good intentions but it
was not followed through with ride-
quatc publicity."

Approximately i3 Juniors at-

ccrtl. The Chronicle stated that one-
tlrird ol' the nation's private institu—
tions reported losses of more than
it) pcrcctit irt their freshman classes
last fall.

The reasons for this confusion
between admisssions data corn-
pared to the enrollment data con-
tained in the Chronicle's report is
that application trends are almost
irrelevant. according to Hart. The
basic component for evaluating
educational trends is actual enroll-
ment. not applications. he said.

“There is nothing terribly dif-
ferent going on," said Hart about

 

“liverylrody who is running around
putting their names in for seli'~
nomination didn't come to this
mccting." he charged.

Several candidates later e\p|aincd
that tiicy either hadn't heard about
the meeting or had prior conirnitt-

Vice Presidential candidate Mike
llr'tiseo said he hadn't heard about

ing for specific enrploytnent upon
graduation. especially in such
growth industries as computers and
related programs such as data pro-
ccssing.

Total statewide figures overall for
both private and public institutions
show that enrollment is down .5
percent or 5.181 students. Accor-
ding to the report this decrease is
due mostly to a decline in graduate
and part time enrollment. The N.Y.
State report revealed a drop in
graduate enrollmemt of five per-
cent.

the enrollment in colleges. in fact
the quality of incoming students is
higher than in the past." This trend
is the result of the national
economic situation and the valtte of
public cdtrcation. he maintained.
The state’s survey reported that
the largest increase statewide was at
community colleges. wlicre enroll-
rnenl was up four percent. This
growth is' most likelth reflection of
the state's economy. Hart added.

public school applications reflects
reluctance to apply early. rather
than a ftittire decrease in public

pecting any kind of drop ofrihat
magnitude in actual enrollmerii next

fall.“ he said.

Regarding the future of public
cdtrcaiiort. llart was optimistic. “If
