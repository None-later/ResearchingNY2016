Interferon. all enzyme produced
within the molecular cell. rtlay be
tlte long sought cure for cancer. as
well as tlte colllrllott cold. according
to biology professor (‘orrttdo
llaglioni.

In his lecture. “ lhe liody‘s [first
line of Defense against Viral Infec-
tion: llltcrferott arid How it
Works." llaglioni discussed the
"encouraging" possibilities of in-
terferon rrsed nith otller drugs to
stop the common cold aml to slow
down tile growth of cancer cells.

According to liaglioni. interferon
used on volunteer cancer patierlts

lllterferorl is a protein tltat is
secreted by cells when they are ill-
I'ected by a virus. 'fhis secretion
prepares uninfected cells for tile
virus infection. causing llleln to
nnuurfacture enzymes that are not
usually present. These enzymes
make tile uninfected cells resistarlt
so that when the virus rcaclles them
the infection is stopped.

culturing. harvesting. and purifying
tltat bacteria. interferon is currently
being manufactured ill large quarr-
lities by biotechnology companies
and beillg experimented witlt across
the country.

Baglioni also discussed cs-
perimenrations lll lingland. where
volunteers are sprayed with ill-
terl‘er'on and then infected with
drops of a virus so researcllers cart
monitor the colds which tlte_\
develop. “Ten years ago a spray ol
interferon cost a luutdrcd dollars.
Now it‘s doun to ten dollars. soon
it will be a dollar a spray." said
Ilaglioni.

Cattle vaccinated witll interferon
have avoided “shipping fever."

tlcss were prevented when in-
terferon was used itt cotllbirlatiotl
with other drugs.

llaglioni is now investigating anti-
viral and anti-cancer agents. lie is
funded by tile National (‘artcer lu-
