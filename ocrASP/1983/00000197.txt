The report was made by a com-
mittee named by the Conference

Councils. In all. ihc report
evaluated 639 doctoral programs in
seven fields in the social and
behavioral sciences. In the field of
sociolgy. approximately 92 |’h.D.
programs wcrc cvaluatcd. and
Albany was ranked in llll.‘ top 30. In
terms of improvement ovcr the past
five years. Albany and thc Univcrsi-
ty of Arizona shared the highest
rating. Thc mcun scorc of all lhc
schools was 50. with Albany scoring
78.
