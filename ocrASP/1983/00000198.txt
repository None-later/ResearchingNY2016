students first started working for

In fact. student support of

For students. llingamartt said. it's
a basic question of survival: either
boost state revenues through tax in-
crcases, or watch higher education
slowly deteriorate or even disap-
pear. llinois. l'or esamplc, is cott—
sidcting closing sortie of its state
campuses.

“Students teali/e that they need
increased state rcvctirres so that

“And next year looks even more
devastating." Lehman said. Stu-

$230 for lUHJ-l‘)tl4 without some
changes iii the state budget pictitre.

Lehman‘s group is therefore stip-
porting a proposed tax on cigarettes
and a rtcw oil scverartce tax.

"I suppose supporting these in-

acknowledges. “lint there isn't
