The Albany State varsity lacrosse
learn was in a very urrenviable posi-
tion. First. they had to open their
season in Virginia—a state better
known for its 7'4“ basketball
players—against a very tough learn
frotrr Randolph Macon. Six days
later they had to retrrrrl to RN to
face an Engineer learn that they
hadn't beaten in six years. Any pro-
blem? No cltance. The Danes swept
both games. arid their 2~() beginning
is the best start the team has ever
had.

A quick start scents to be a most
this season, as the Dartes face one
of their most rugged schedules itt re-

“We have no breathcrs this year.“

The team does have five IlL'\\

he noted.

Albany will hit the road again
tomorrow to lake on a very tough
squad from RIT. who also defeated
Randolph Macon earlier llris year
and were victors over the Danes last
year. “They always have a very
good ream. and are always very
quick." Molta commented.

The Danes then visit Cortland on
Tuesday. The Red Dragons have
such an outstanding program. ac-
cording to Mottrt. that "they should
be in Division l." Albany then
opens its home season on April l4
against llartwick.

Despite the presence of rrrarry
challenging games, Motla feels the
learn is just starting to come irrlo its
own. "All we really need is to win
sortie games arid establish a wlrttting
tradition." he said. "We have a
very young learn with only forrr
seniors. and we seem to he headed
in the right direction."

If the Danes continue to play well
against top-notch schools, they may
head toward that direction much
faster titan they expected to. l

season."

llre Danes nest game will be on
the road against Sierra. The team‘s
lrorrrc opener will be tomorrow
afternoon, a doubleheader against
