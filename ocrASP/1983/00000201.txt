The Albany State Great Dattes
baseball team opens its seasott tltis
afternoon against tlte St. Lawrence
University Fighting Saints at
University Field at 3:00 pm. The
Danes‘ home opener against l-larl-
wick scheduled for last Monday was
postponed dtte to bad weather artd
poor field conditions. A Tuesday
afternoon doubleheader in
llinghamton was cancelled for tlte
saute reasons.

Senior Mike Garttnart will be on
the mound when Albarty plays its
first game under new head coacit
Dave Haight. The righthandcr was
l-2 last year attd was tltird on the
teartt in innings pitcltcd artd liltA.

Gartman itad a strong outing
against the New York Mels Rookies
team in Florida dttring the spring
break. The Danes posted a 1-4
record itt Florida, losing twice to
the Mets, 27-9 arid lZ-J and taking
one of three front (‘anisus ('ollege.
Albany lost the first two games,
l0-4 and 9-0 before copping their
only victory of the trip, 8-5.

"The scores of 'he garues didn‘t

cond year as a starter at first base.
He had a good showing irt Florida
and his ltittrtg appears to be much
improved front last year.

Tony Torres, an outstanding
defensive player, will be at second
base for Albany. “He is a very
smart ballplayer with an excellent

'Wiimg,

eye at the plate and a good ott-basc
percentage." Karwath commented.
Dave Theleman. a freshman,
won the starting shortstop position
because of art outstanding perfor-
martce in Florida. "He really in).
pressed as.” Karwath said. “He
won it with his bat and glove."

'l'hird base will be ancltored by
Bob Conklin, the Danes' second
leading ltitler and a notoriously
slow starter. Cortklin hit .380 last
year artd his .560 slugging percen-
tage was second best on the team.

The otrtfield will be patrolled by
littglt Davis irt center, (.‘ircg Mttlhall

) .

l

Danes begin season today vs. Fighting Saints

itt left and Mike Voshurgh in right.
Davis is vastly improved, acording
to Karwath. Davis, who stole 14
bases last year to lead the Danes is
swinging a “mean bat“ rtow, and
has improved on defettse. Mttlhall is
probably the best defensive out-
fielder Albany has; lte possesses a
good strong arm. Vosbttrgh is a
power hitter, wlto will be up in tile
middle of the batting order, accor-
ding to Karwath.

Albany will begin their SUNYAt
season on Saturday as they trat cl to
Cortland for an afternoon
doubleheader. The scheduled
starters are Ron Massaroni and
Volk, l'he Red Dragons tleleated

coaclt Kevin Kar'wath explained.
"We had only been otrtsidc for
tltrec dttys before we wertt dowrt to
Florida. The purpose of the trip is
to give tts sotne game practice. We
played cvcryotte on the roster itt
every game attd no pitcher went
more than tltree innings in a game.‘

(iartman. a co-cuptain along with
senior pitcher Ralph Volk, will try
to sltul dowtt a strong St. Lawrence
learn. “They are supposed to be
outstanding," Karwulh said. “l'vc
heard nothing bad about them."

The Danes offensive attack will
be led by .lerry Roscn. Rosen ltil
.467 last year and drove ill 32 runs
to lead the learn itt botlt categories.
Nortnally the Danes starting cat-
cher. Rosctt will probably start at

Fighting Saints. “.lerr‘y did trot
make the trip with tts to l~'lorida.
We want to work him back irtto the
lineup." Karwath said. “He will
probably be back at catcher the “CM
garlic.”

Freshman Mike Murphy will get
the start behind the plate, according
to Karwath. “He did a great job
defensively for us dowtt irt l-‘lorida
