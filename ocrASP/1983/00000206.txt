SUNYA establijhed a c_htiptcriol‘

the New York State Council of (‘ol-
lcge Students for Special Olympics
this semester. just in tiriic for this
summer‘s state games. The gaiitcs
will be held on this campus June
17-19, according to Dorothy
Philips. state atlvisor and founder
of tile NYSCCSSU.

The idea for NYSCCSSO, said
Philips got off tlte grotirid in [979 at
llrockport witcii tltc excitement
created by the international (Harries,
held tliat summer, was at its peak.

“We wanted to capture tltat spirit
and keep it tip when we began at
Brockport," she said. There are
now chapters of the state council at
Brockport, Geneseo, and Baffan
State as well as Daemon College in
Amhcarst, NY.

According to Philips. these
groups net as a “support arm" for
wltiehever Special Olympics district
the college is loctilcd in. SUNYA's
chapter is part of area 10 serving
Albany, Columbia, (ireenc,
Renssulear, Schenectady arid
Schoharic Counties.

"Albany was nest in line to start
a chapter," said Philips, partly
because of the area gatitcs being
held May l, as well as liostltig the
state games irt .lurte.

The addition of certain teatiis to
the games will make this summer's
gritnes the largest ever held in the
state.

in explaining why college
students are irtiportarit to the
Special Olympics Philips said.
“Because we've hcett going since
i970, coordinators have noticed a
htirrr otrt in their areas. and students
corrre irt with a lot of energy. This
group is particularly dedicated.“

The Special Olympics was created
in was by the Joseph P. Kennedy
Jr. Foundation and has grown to
become the largest program of
sports training and athletic corn-
pctition for iiietitally retarded kids
and adults; it gives people the op-
portunity to partake in activities
they had newer been able to.

“These are the kids wbd get held
out from little league baseball."
said Philips. The attiliide is, "No
one wattts Tommy. He‘s too slow."
slte explained.

A pamphlet ptit out by Special
Olympics expresses the gartics as “a
sport iii the truest seitsc. The goal is
not to win. biit to try —~ to ex-
perience, not to conquer. No little is
too slow. no distance too small to
earn a ribbon, a ling, a cheer, or ii
sincere ‘wcll done'."

The students involved with the
college council say they warit to
hpr accomplish these goals. “l was
a clowti for the ltiteriiatiortal ()lym-
pics at Brockport," said the Presi-
dent oi‘ the SUNYA (.‘hapter Deb-
bie Budd. "it was the best thing
I've ever done. I tlrirtk i learned to
look beyond a lot ol‘ material
things, that winning isn‘t the impor-
tant thing, ttiid to look a little
deeper, past everyday life."

You get a lot ol' self-satisfaction
otrt of doing something like this.
'l‘hcse people give you something
other people can't."

Budd said the group is still leani-
irig what its l'uuctious and goals are
bill that basically its purpose is to
serve as a help to the area lllcotiticil
as well as to be an autonoriioiis
orgaiii/ation. “'l'hey‘e (the coliti-
cii) starting to recogui/c its and risk
its to do things." she said.

Budd esplaiiied that the group
started out with no money at all.
They had to rely on flat does from

.- ,. ,..........M *4“... s... - 4. 1

members and ptot‘its from a "guess
the uumberol‘ M&M’s in the jar"
contest to be held . is week in the
eaitipus center. Additionally. the
chapter's first big fund raiser, “a
night at Le Fat Cat" is to be held on

'April 27th. "liven something as

ridiculous as ﬁnding a jar to pitt
M&M‘s iii is a problem catisc we
just don‘t lirive any money." said
Budd.

Public relations chairperson
Susan Fulchook said that the
group's immediate goal is to raise
enough ritoiicy to buy uniforms for
the area kids going to the State

SUNYA establishes Special Olympics chapter

Grimes. "We want them to feel im-
portant and be recognized at the
games," she said.

Budd said she hopes this
“spring's games will get the group
off lite ground” and get people
motivated. in the future. she said.
they hope to rttn nit event at the
State Games and also to coordinate
a training prograrii so they can
work with atiilctes all year.

"People have to realize the
Special Olympics is a year round
thing. There is year long training
and athletes go through different

levels of competition and only the
best get to go on," commented
Falchook.

Students are certified to be
trainers in workshops at area col-
leges which are scheduled
throughout the year.

Biidd commented that the group
welcomes all the help it can get, and
although the response has been
great. there cart never be too ntuch
Icittlursirism. Anyone interested in
becoming involved, she said should
watch for meetings or call Susan
Falchook at 457-3066. l

Loeb stresses nukes ’ burden, gift

By Amy Kllgus
\I‘lII built

Paul Loeb. author of the book
Nuclear Cit/lure. addressed approx-
imately twenty people at SUNYA
Monday night on the “common
burden or gilt" that the discovery
arid use of nuclear weapons has
bestowed on everyolic.

In the discussion, sponsored by
NYI’lR(l, |.ocb etiiphasi/ed that
oitr generation is the first to have to
deal with the issues the discovery of
nuclear weaponry has brought with
it, including the threat ol‘ human ev»
tiriction.

Loeb said there are luo ways for
one to look at it: tirst, as a burden,
or sccoud. as a gilt.

One can look at nuclear

:weapoitry as a gilt, he said, by

ictllilillg that nuclear armament
causes a shared \uhieiability by
everyone iii the world and that this
shared vulnerability allows people
to bridge grips they‘ve timer been
able to bel'orc.

 

"All of us live with the
knowledge we mfg/H not
survive. "

 

iii writing Nllt'lt'tll‘ (‘tI/Itm', l ocb
spctit three years studying the town
of llansl’ord, Washington m home
ol. the world‘s largest atoiriic coni-
pics which has riuinul‘actured the
plutonium Ior hall' the weapons iii
America's arsenals —- which he says
is it "model for how all of tis live
with the knowledge we might not
survive."

The people of llansloid es-
pcrictice a strange juxtaposition in
their lives -— that of "everyday life
in the shadow of producing
materials for a holocaust," he said.

These people who work on the
production of plutonium "concer
Irate on particular discrete tasks"
such as liking one broken part
rather than thinking of producing
phitotiium as a whole, be said. They

"didn‘t make a distinction betwcett
nuclear technology and technology
at borne" — sticli as irobby
building," Loeb observed.

At the bombing of Nagasaki
“they celebrated iii a way in which
they uouldn't reali/c wltat they'd
done...thcy celebrated their efforts
that testtllcd in the war ending
earlier titan they thought it would
have. This way of dealing with the
bombing of Nagasaki was
replicated around the country, he
said.

He also said residents sanctified
the position taken by the experts
because of their credentials which,
Loeb claims, is otin “shutting ol'l‘
their own values and saying the ‘it‘s
someone clse's job,"'

l.oeb advised the group to relieve
discouragement in trying to raise
awareness of the isstie, not to I'orgct
that “you never know when you
touch ii iii others. lzven (‘aspcr
\K’einbetger —- as hard as it may be
to believe — must base it sometime.
even Reagan must." ‘ ‘
