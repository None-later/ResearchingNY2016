"'l'he debates would be limited to the

the world of business.”

Connolly noted that in today’s business
world a well-rounded education is needed.
“The ability to express yourselfaud the abili-
ty to listen to other people is essential. Cont-
munication techniques are needed as well as
technological," lte added.

Key Bank marketing executive Allen
Volkenunt said that "writing and the ability
to communicate are critical in business today.
I know of cases where college graduates with
villA’s have to go to six-week sessions so
they can learn basic sentence structure." ite
remarked. "('ommunieation skills are ttot
beittg emphasized enough on the college
level."

chalors front botlt teams said that they
enjoyed tltctttsclves tremendously. and that
they learttcd a lot about debating and in-
terstate banking in a short period of time.

Both judges ruled that the Union team.
supporting the negative view. won the debate
over the Skidntore tcatn. supporting the af-
firntative. Kendall said that the two teams
were equal itt two ottt of tittcc judgement
areas. but that Union was stronch itt its sum—
tttary of the ttegalisc view. She added that the
affirmative is always tnotc difficttlt to slip-
port, since they beat the bttrdctt of proof.
attd that “the issue is innocent until proven
guilty." Kendall comtnentcd that the 30
minute questiotmtnswer session with the au-
dicttce (not allowed in formal debates)
"strengthened the debate. added to the en-
joytncnt attd showed the depth of knowledge
of both the dcbatot's attd tltc audience."
