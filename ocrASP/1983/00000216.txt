Student rents won ’t benefit b

__ _ ___ ___._

As energy prices rose over the last
nine years. college ltottsitrg costs
rose Witlt them. But as oil prices
now decline. carriptis housing of-
t‘ieials around the coirritry report
tliai what went tip isn't necessarily
going to come down for students.

Few schools have allowed tlteir
lower eitcrgy prices to interfere with
their now-annual springtime an-
nouncements ol‘ lriglter housing
prices for next fall.

“You‘d expect that since higher
oil prices bought housing costs tip.
then lower oil prices wottld bring
them back down." concedes lioh
Sherman. Yale's director of utilities
and energy conservation.
"Realistically, it isn‘t likely to be
that way."

Any money Yale saves from
lower energy costs will go toward
paying off the conservation hard-
ware it has bought over the ltist few
years.

- ~ A.J‘.‘.:W’"'anu—-W ‘-

lt‘s happening that way at
schools across the country.

“The volatile nature of energy
prices practically gauarantees that
there will be no itntnediate reduc-
tions in housing costs." says Chris
(‘rittendcn. who heads the joint
energy task force of tltrce national
college tutministrutors' Orgatti/tt-
lions.

l'lc's found that “students aren‘t
likely to see the benefits of the oil
slump unless they are at one of the
schools that has been addirtg energy
charges to the basic rootn rents."

Bill George Washington Univer-
sity. one the schools that lacked cv-
tra “energy surcharges" onto hous-
ing bills. dropped its surcharge two
years ago.

Lower fuel costs, however. ltnve
saved the hoiisng office there art c»
Ira 345.000 so far this year.

(iW Director of Housing David
Mclilvceri figures it amounts to
abotrt $l0t) per student itt university
housing, but residents shouldn't
ecxpect a refund.

“Unfortunately. beause of the
long lead time it 'ilvcd in planniitg
the (housing) 'otidgct. students
won't be getting a tedttctioti in
room rates." Mciilvccn says.
“Maybe we‘ll get ottr new furniture
a little earlier than we expected."

“It's a litle early to he jubilant
over a drop in oil prices.” points
oirt l’airl Knapp. chief ot‘ the
Association of Physical Plarit Ad-
ministrators of Universities and
Colleges.

“it ought to relieve some of the
pressure." lie says. “but unless oil
goes down faster than itifltitiort
drives everything else tip. it won't
ltclp much. ldon't think dorm rates
would ever go down because of it."

Though ()PlEC's benchmark
price recently ttiiitblctl l7 percent
and the Reagan adritinislration
t'orccasted an annual irritation rate
oi just 4.5 percent. the University
of Nebraska is seemingly the only
school prepared to pass the savings
on to students directly,

“I lltirtk | cart expect a tnore

 

moderate three-to-fivc percent in-
crease in housing costs," says NU
Housing Director Douglas
Zatechka. “instead of the eight.
nine. ii and 13 percent increases
that some schools have been
seeing." -

"it isn’t art entirely altruistic
motivation." he adds. "I need to
keep our halls filled. and to do that
we must be financially attractive."

Washington State. Georgia. (‘rW
arid Yale are among those who have
the systems.

7"” oil becomes really corti-
petitive here. we‘ll burn it." says
’l‘cd Simon of Georgia's physical
plaril department. “Right now. coal
is our cheapest option."

littt not all conservation measures
have paid off. Wesleyan University
physical plaiit director Peter
Tvcskov contends schools that stall-
ed conservation measures now
stand the best cltattcc of getting
federal funds to help tltetii.

"Those of its that litrve been pitt-
ting our own resources into conscr-

ration haven't had muclt luck get-
ting federal ftrnds beeattsc we can‘t
show dratnatic differences made by
the projects." ltc says. "Tire work
has already been done."

"in that sense. i think we've been
punished for our foresight."

Tveskov also wonders if colleges
will now forget about their energy
conservation programs altogether.

"in the seventies, the conserva‘
tiori movement was as much
ideological as economic." llL'
observes. "it became primarily
economic. Now. for sortie people. it
isn‘t tnuclr of art issue at all."

“The oil stump hit at a tiriie when
many schools are considering ntitlti'
million dollar conversion projects,"
Crittertdcn adds. "I suspect this
situation is going to ptrt the skids on
those kinds of major capital in-
vestrncnts."

(.‘tittenilcn advises colleges to
proceed even if "administrators are
going to be tempted to build the
new gym or the neu arts building
instead." [ .
