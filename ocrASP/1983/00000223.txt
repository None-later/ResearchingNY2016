Thc tail. light haired. athletically
built young man was led out to the
piano bench. Adjusting the
microphone with conﬁdence. he
began to play the piano as he spoke.
"i really believe tltat life is a
celebration." said Tom Sullivan.
speaking candidly to approximately
ﬁfty people in the Catnpus Center
Ballroom on Wednesday nigltt. "A
major factor in deciding that life is
a celebration was deciding that be-
ing blind is O.K."

Sullivan. who has been blind
since shortly after birtlt. works as a
correspondant for Good Morning
America. He has also made guest
appearances on such shows as
Fame. M.A.S.H., Magnum
P. I.,and Mark and Mindy. in addi-
tion to his acting accomplishments,
Sullivan has put out two record
albums. four books. and a movie
about his life. "if You Could See
Wltat l Hear."

"i started in the entertainment
business because i was broke." said
Sullivan. When he was in college at
Harvard he knew how to play three
sottgs on the piano and got a job
playing rtt a nearby bar. “My pro-
blem was tltut i played the same
three songs fifteen times each that
night and I got fired." he cltucklcd.

in addition to singing and speak-
ing about life, Sullivan also fielded
questions from members of the au-

dience. When asked about his
grades at Harvard. he replied "My
first semester 1 had the highest
grades in the psych./soc. depart-

pleaded innocence. One year in
prison and a line not to exceed $500
can be levied against persons cort—
vieted of cow starving.

“l categorically deny that they
have not been properly fed." Lan-
l‘ord anrtounccd to the Albany
Times Union. “it's bad enough to
lose the cows." the farmer of forty
years continued. “but then to be ar-
rested. is to rub salt irtto the
wounds. Tltcy fingerprintcd and
photographed me as if i was a COm-
mon criminal."

Lanford oversees about 100 peo-
ple and about $120 million worth of
university construction and
rehabilitation projects as executive
officer of the State University Con-
struction Fund, his other job.

“All cIIrCasses were extremely
emaciated." Dr. John lluntlcy. a
member oi the state agriculture and
markets department. said in a state-
ntcnt for the presiding judge. The
cow that underwent euthanasia was
"unable to rise and unaware of its
surroundings," Huntley's report
said.

"They have not been
maltreated." Lunl‘ord rctorted. “l
feed them twice a day myself." he
told tlte Times Union. He also men-
tioned the possibility of poisoning
or disease.

“We're just at a loss to know
what on earth is going on." Lan-
ford's wife told the newspaper.

merit." But. as a result of his in-

i. with LIIILI ' he
"went from the top of the depart-
ment to the lowest grades ever
recorded.” he said and laughed
along with the audience.

Sullivan doesn't think of himself
as at a disadvantage because of his
blindness. but rather that he is dif-
ferent and does things differently
frorn other people. "To be different
is the greatest accomplishment you
can make as a human being.” he
said. He also remarked that we live
in a system of labels that are not
healthy. "i get very down when l
atn treated with prejudice because
of my blindness.“ initially, Sullivan
was out to prove himself to other
people. Now lte says “I still have
that same insatiable drive, but i do

team. Sullivan proved that “any
human being can turn disadvantage
into advantage."

After the show someone asked
Sullivan whether he would have
made a differnet career choice if he
wasn't blind. “i would have played
professional sports." he said very
definitely.

Sullivan said of his fourteen-year
marriage to his wife Patti. "it's
been an amazing experience." They
have two children: a daughter
Blythe.l3. and a son Tom. to. "A
concert or board of directors
meeting is not as important as being
with the children." he replied.

One day while Tom and lllytlte,’
who was then 5. were swimming in
their pool. Tom received an impor-
tant phone call regarding a record

things for myself."

"Until l was eight I didn't cveil
(now I was blind.“ Sullivan said.
He explained that he lind been
listening to a little league game from
his fenced irt backyard. "I guess my
parents figured, ‘wc'll keep him irt
and we‘ll keep life out.‘ " he said.
Every time he heard the baseball
hit, he hit II rock with It stick. After
the game. one of the players came
up to the fence and said, “How ya
doin‘ blindy?“ it was at that mo-
nent that Sullivan realized he "had
.0 be part of that boy‘s world."
Sullivan practiced by throwing a
ball at a transistor radio which he
placed on a tree stump. When he
thought he was good enough. he ar-
ranged to pitch in a game. By the
sixth batter. the count was tip to
three balls and two strikes and
Sullivan knew ltow important the
next pitch was. “i threw the ball
and hit the boy attd that was the end
of my baseball career," he joked.

Sullivan did not give up on
sports. “l practiced golf at mid-
night because. of course, it didn't
matter at what time I played." he
said. He trained his guide dog.
Dinah. to retrieve the balls. He tried
many sports with little success until
It coach suggested that he try wrestl-
ing. He not only tried it. he became
so good that he wrestled for Har-
vard as well as for the 1968 Olympic

recording. He became so ittvolvcd
with the phone call that he was no
longer paying attention to lllythe.
When he realized that he no longer
heard splashing. he began calling
her natnc. When she didn‘t answer.
he jumped ittto the water but
couldn't find her. “it was the first
titnc i saw myself as a person with
an inconvenience." he said. Then
everything was quiet and Tom
realized he heard air bubbles com-
ing from the water. He followed the
sound of the bubbles and rescued
his daughter from nine feet of
water. If i had lost her i don‘t think
i would have ever come out of it,"
re replied in answer to a question
’rom the audience.

“You know in my whole life i
have never met an ugly person
unless they wanted to be, unless
they chose to be. There's a song
that I think says it a lot better thanl
could." He sat down at the piano
and began to play rich. bold chords
that were characteristic of the
beginnings of songs he played on
Wednesday night.The songs flowed
from loud. full tones to soft high
notes and then he ended with just
his voice right before his last few
.‘liOrtlS on the piano. "...and just
possibly if you look. you’ll find the
reality in you and me." he sang. At
.lte cttd of the song his etttirc face lit
up as he smiled. l. l
