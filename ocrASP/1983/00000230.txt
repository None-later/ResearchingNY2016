escending opinion

the Editor:
- fter reading the letter in Tuesday's ASP by Dave Asher
- Will Yurman. l began to question exactly what duties
- responsibilities must be accepted along with freedom of
press. While 1 am a strong believer in this privilege, l
t thrrt it must be used with great care. i am not sure that
ASP understood its responsibilities when printing Tucs-
's endorsements. and. in fact. one can question what
ASP's position actually is.
ording to the Constitution of the United States. the
' has the right to prltit its views on certain issues. But
sldcr this: while commercial newspapers. each have ft
min constituency (which they must satisfy. or suffer loss
-. tiles). The ASP is the only independent voice on crun-
' .us Asher and Yurmirn pointed out. Therefore. its views
virtrutlly unchallenged. and that is not why the first
cndtncut was established.
rirthcrmorc 1 would like to poiiil otit the shabby and iii
jriute job the ASP did in endorsing candidates. For ex-
is, look at the cast of SA vice president. The headline.
hncidcr—thc Right Skills". gives the impression that
ncldcr is the best candidate. However. the opening
raph of this article states that botir candidates are
bio of handling the job. The article then goes on to first
so Schneider. then point out his wctrkrtc..cs (many of
). and ﬁnally iii the last paragraph. acclaim irirrt as the
candidate.

 equally inadequate job was also done on Rot

'1 kin's evaluation. As is Schneider's endorsement. this
clc also goes from first praising Fishkin to cutting him

n. How can the stntcrrtcnts “he is not it candidate too

1y dismissed" and “the students would be better served
someone else in the position. . . " be said about the
person in the same article? This shows that either the
 endorses candidates without really supporting tiicni.
 ‘ply for the sake of endorsement. or the ASP's writer's
its never taught to focus on one poiitt from opening to

- . his letter is not meant to undo tiny injustice to Fishkin.
. “have never met either candidate. its purpose is to poitrt
oirtrhar an apparently uninformed newspaper should not
the powcrto so easily shape the student's decisions.
Perhaps the student conrmuniry tit SUNYA would be better
served if the responsibility of getting votes was placed on

the candidates alone.
—liarry thmnn

The ASP invited decent/trig opinions and that is" why we
'print letters .r‘uch as Asher and Yunnan '.\‘. as well as the
above letter. Obviously we felt Jeff Schneider was the
stronger of the two candidates or else we would not have
endorsed hint. However. no one is per/01'! and we believe it

is valuable to point out n L'tlllt/ltlalt’ ‘x faults: —f.:'rl.

me.l assure him. and all Jews. that the letter was not a
cheap shot at the Jewish traditions. but was in defense of
UAS — an organization which tries harder than most. Just
ask anyone who goes to Coblcskiil or Onconta.

i am deeply hurt that friends of mine who are Jewish
took this as an attack on them. I simply wished to express
that Mr. Savitt's letter was not 100 percent accurate.
Catholics are not given its preferential treatment as he leads
us to believe. i simply think that he should work with UAS.
as i have; to obtain his goals.

To be fair to Joe. however. my letter was not 100 percent
accurate either. i was unaware it limited number of meals
were available on Dutch. 1 never said that UAS was not in-
sensitive on that night of Passover. just to work with them
to avoid it happening next year. UAS is not the monster
many of us tltirik it is. Give it rt chance.

if i have lost friends because of this letter. l‘m sorry. I
cannot believe this letter was the cause of such ringer rind
pain. .101- Suvitt‘s religious belief is not in question here —
he is very active on crittipus in Judaic organizations and is
proud -- as he should be - to be it .lcw.

in short, I wish to apologize for the improper phrasing of
April iz's letter. Although I still don't agree with his letter.
I did not intend the response its itiiti-scmitic. Tlll.‘ only iri-
tention wits to get Joe to work with UAS — not to write
against it.

Music to the people

To the Editor:

We at UCll don't trike our jobs lightly; we may only he
students and yet we consider ourselves iit it professional
light since we deal with professionals (rrmnttgcrs. techni-
clans. rortdics. musicians. talent agents. radio stations.
critics. the list could go on...) year round.

The University Concert Board is composed of thirteen
hardworking individuals turd approximately 100 committee
members who do everything from choosing the acts and
running weekly meetings (i0 p.m. every Monday lit the
CC. Assembly Hall) to mopping floors in the Palace
Theatre and searching for drummers asleep in the wrong
hotel room.

We are serious individuals who attend conferences from
which we bring back valuable knowledge that in trrrn
beitcfits any intcrcstcd student and the entire university
community. We realize as humans tliul sometimes we make
mistakes and because of this qrirility we acknowledge rlrrrt
an oversight (due to lack of reporters or spring break) must
have been made by the ASP when not one review of the
March 21 Joe Jackson concert graced the pages of our fine
studcur publication.

This concert was presented by UCll and 91 PM rriid for
the first time since Dari Fogclbcrg four years ago. rtt'fordcd
SUNYA students the sole opportunity to purclitlsc tickets
for the first two days oi'srilcs (the concert sold out in llll’CC).

We don‘t ask for much. our job is self-rewarding. btit
itiaity of our fellow siuricuts' tuttjoi' cruiiplrriuls are that
they weren't aware that it production was \itltlL‘Ill iriri. and

Biting sarcasm

To the Editor:
We would like to rebut Mr. DeCastro's letter of April film
in the ASP.

Mr. DcCastro. your great sarcasm was offensive to many
of us.

We understand that UAS has a “tough job." even
though most students don't realize it. We hope that people
can become aware of the services provided by UAS its
stated in Mr. DcCastro's icttcr (c.g.: a dictician on the
premises. ability to figitt for different and better food).

UAS tries to accomodnlc the Catholic students by serving
fish on Fridrty nights. Due to circumstances beyond “their”
control. spccini foods for dietary purposes may not be
available. Being chs. we assumed (as you did during Lent)
that UAS would be prepared to meet our needs. it seemed
this wasn't so. information was limited about the Passover
urcrils before the vacation. Many who would have signed up
in advance didn't know they had to. Since menus Wcrcn't
publicized beforehand no one knew what to expect for din-
ner ou the last night of l’assovcr. When we found out what
was being served (brctidcd chicken parmcgiau and'hnm) it
was too true to get l’itssovcr meals on Dutch because they
were "sold out." So what choice did the Jews have on the
last night of I’rtssover‘! inconvenience (by going out) or
starving...

Mr. DcCrrstro. you as the average student priyiiig board
rules do not contribute to the kosher kitchen in rill. Only
those paying $200 more it scmcstcr do. Fact: The kosher
kitchen was only moved whcrr UAS rcnovutcd riic Drrtch
Quad cafeteria.

Mr. DcCastro. is it your business to judge ltow religious
another is? It's just its easy to say that Catholics do not
have fish on Lent. From now on. do all the Jews Lt favor
and keep you sarcastic remarks out of tire ASP.

Stay with jazz

To the Editor:

1 am enraged and appalled by WCDB's recent
managerial decision to drastically reduce jazz shows. The
new policy. effective April it, no longer represents i1 vital
segment of SUNYA's radio listenership. Under the new
policy jazz. shows will bl: reduced from 21 hours a week to
only ii. Third'Wnrld will replace these hours. increasing
their shows from 2| to 24 hours a week. .

As it graduating senior l cart easily be apathetic and ig-
nore this issue. After all. my time at SUNYA is almost at a
close. Yet. as it jttzz lisrcrteri fch it is necessary to call to at-
tention to the manager of WCDl} a viable and existing jazz
listcricr'sirip. One only has to iurrc into QI04's newly added
jrizz show to see this. if it commercial station is willing to
commit timc rind money to it jazz program they must ob-
vioust feel there is a lucrative ruidlcticc iii the capital
district.

rock, 21 for jti/l. irud 21 for third world. To dccicuxc the
hours of jit/z i'rir iiicr seriously cutiipi'omiscs \\’('l)ll'x sup-
posed dedication to dirersity.

To the sirrtcmcnr by the managers that there is not it
viable jziz/ rtrirhcricc. i ask. on what basis has this decision
been ititrde'.’ When wits the last time a good xoliti research
poll was Irikcri of Sititlulllx on campus? No such effort has
been tirade and to me this can only represent mismanage-
merit turd lack of full cornmiirmerrr by the inrrrigers in divcr-
sil)’.

A major problem with keeping jazz on the air is finding
DJ'x. Six out of the seven jazz DJ's are graduating and as
of now there tire only four to replace ihcui.Tiicrc are many
jazz. enthusiasts on crutipus unaware of the opportunity
open to them to become a DJ. A campaign to recruit. cu-
couragc and train jrtzz 1)J’s by advertising a special jazz in-
tcr'cs’t meeting would require minimal effort and expense.

This can only be accomplished tiirougii the combined el’
forts of the jazz director and the top executive at WCDB ——
an effort which up till now has been lacking. if the jam
department has been lax iu lhicr efforts to promote jazz.
this only reflects an even larger lack of motivation nu lllL
part of the top executives at WCDB. it is their responsibili-
ty to find enthusiastic directors and DJ's for their depart
iricnls. Cutting a whole program until it is almost llOnOXlx
taut is not the proper solution to a personnel problem.

WCDB is it noncommercial station which gives it the
liberty to move away frorri the top forty stylc. Musical
diversity has always been one of WCDB‘s strong points. I
suggest WCDB trike a closer look at its community and
campus ruidicncc. SUNYA does not live on rock and roll
