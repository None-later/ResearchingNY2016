Urban policy studied at SUNYA

 

By Bob Gardinler

STAFF WRITER

 

Reaganomics is a “contraction of the welfare state
and an expansion of the warfare state." said
sociologist Richard Hill of Michigan State University
during his presentation at “Urban Theory and Na-
tional Urban Policy for the 1980's." a conference of
leading urban theorists lreld at the university.

Urban research and developrrrertt. In the light of re-
cent economic trends and the new federalism. was the
focus of the indcptlr discussion this past weekend at
SUNYA's Alumni House to evaluate the Reagan ad-
ministration’s appronelr to urban revitilization.

The conference was a chance for experts and
specialists from rrrarry disciplines to discuss. from a
sociological perspective. ways to reforrrr and revitalize
cities and cornrrnrrrities. Although the tone of the corr-
ference ran theoretical. there were sorrre relevant
points rrrade regarding existing conditions in corn-
mnnitlcs.

The present administration has condemned the
federalism idea. lIilI corrtirrtred. becarrsc the program
has less to do with the advancement and betterment of
the communities. "It irrstigates stiff competition bet-
weert the states and the communities over the scarccr
federal dollars." he said.

Schenectady (‘ounty Manager. Robert Mclivoy.
who was present at the conference. said that "there is a
need for new thinking and new structures at the local
level because there are less dollars available from the
federrtl level."

l-Iill went on to explain that the assumption of the
present administration. that to free up and facilitate
large corporations and conglomerates hold the only
solution. is way off base. “’l‘hesc corrglorrrcrates are
only interested itr their own profits; they are rrtrl irr-
tercslcd in trrban policy or development.” he said.

The big corporations, Hill said. wipe otrt the local
small businesses or ttltsotlt them. the present trend be—
ing for these companies to leave the Us. for foreign
work markets. 'I Ire corrrnrttnities Irave no control over
what these large corporations do. according to Hill.
H’l'ltct'c is a need for new political action within the
communities if they arc to improve. in this sense the
New Right might be on the right track.“ stud Ilill.

“the trend should be for rrrore planning on the
corrtrrrttrtity letel. l‘lre community has to take oter
some control ol lllc conglomerates. brrt the center of
the debate for trrlrarr theorists is just who will be irr—
volved in this planning." llill c\plttittcd after the con-
fercrrcc.

A rncrrrbcr of lltc ('entcr for Women in (iovermrrent
at SUNYA. [\nty Svirsky. disagreed with Hill's
assumption that more authority should be taken on the
communin lerel. “A lot of corrrrptiou and bad
government cst on the local level.“ she said. Monies
allocated to the localities Irave been often misspcnt. ac-
cording to Svirxky. the reason being the existancc of
favoritism, party rrraelrirre politics and bad manage-
rrrerrt.

“There has to be some marriage between these
theories of urban developrtrerrt and the reality of

political power in action on the local level," said Svlr-
sky.

According to a member of the sociology department
of the University of California. Roger Frcidland.
“small businesses are more competativc and prevelent
than ever before. I strongly disagree with Mr. Hill‘s
ideas." Bernard Weinstein of the John Gray Institute
in Beaumor, Texas. agreed with Freidland and refuted
Hill’s ideas also. saying that "there is muclt evidence
to support the assumption that small businesses are
growing in the communities."

Hill agreed with this. but. Ire said. “hundreds of
these small businesses might exist in an area and are
only peripheral suppliers or rely on the conglomerate
corporations. One of these conglomerates goes under
or moves. and you lose a hundred of the small
businesses." Ire said.

“We cart no longer refer to the corporatiott as otrrs
on the cornrrrrrirrity level. They are beyond llre corn-
rrrurrity control," said University of California
sociologist Harvey Moloteh.

“The trend should be for
more planning on the
community level. ”

— Richard Hill

Molotch had some criticism for the appropriation of
the work cottlracted otrt by the defense department.
"The areas that benefit most from the del‘enseindustry
need it the least." Ire said.

"Iintct'prisc lones should Ire set rip and the defense
rlepartrrrerrt should be given tax breaks to contract
rrurre work out to the needy areas." said Molotclr.

llill stated that thch ctttctptiw Iones - needy areas
where industries can get tax breaks it. they locate 7—
"are a plausible solution arrtl very helpful btrt are not
being used as c\tettsively or successfully as they should
be."

Mololt:lr predicted that the \llllltt‘ll will soon cv-
perierrce some rtegative repercussions front the influx
of new industry there. "Increasian Illtlll\lllitlllilllt)lt ol'
the sunbelt \\‘lll \trolt experience some negative reper-
eussions from the inth ol‘ new industry there. “Irr-
creasing industriah/rttion of the sunbelt area may |ra\c
some very costlv ecological consequences that might
rrrake the present situations of the northern area look
\Iiglll in cornparimn," Ire said.

Progressive trrbarr policy changes “will not advance
by flapping otrr right and left wings exclusively," said
SUNY-Stony llr'ook sociologist (Ilenn Yugo. Siding
with the opinions of most theorists at the conference,
Yago believed that arty effort at urban inrprotcrrrent
rrrtrst corrrc from cooperation of differing views.

“Urban research artd change has been narrowed by
etrong political and industrial interests on every level."
said Yago. He cited a reccrtt event in California where
