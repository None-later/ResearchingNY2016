rent the Shakers' request to halt
onstructten of the ballpark. One
ay before the hearing, the agree-
; ent bctwccn the town of Colonic
nd the A’s authorizing the team to
se a new stadium was postponed.
he team‘s gcncral manager, Bcn
crnard, failed to show up for thc
igning.

In the interim. Ward has charged
1 at both the county and the town
avc failed to fully cxaminc “all of
- c environmental issues" surroun-
tlic construction of tire
adium. and said he Is requesting
it Environmental Impact Stale-
cnl (ElS) be made by boili partics.
Ward argues that the entire area
ctwccn Albany Airport and Ann
cc Pond is the sitc of the ﬁrst
hakcr scttlcmcnt in the country.
c also says the cemetery has been

 

designated as a national historic
landmark in the National Register.

County Executive James Coync
has insisted that all the issues were
examined. and that Is why the coun-
ty wcnt ahcad with the signing of
the agreement with the Albany-
Colonie A's. In a recent article in
the Albany mics-Union. Coync
said. “I could understand it (the
Shaker lawsuit) if we were moving
the ccmctcry or bulldozing it."

Coync said he is optimistic about
the outcome of the lawsuit. whilc
Ward offcrcd he is only “guardcdly
optimistic."

Sources say the town of Colonic
made only “a cursory rcvicw of co-
vironmcntal issues" at the stadium-
ccmctcry site. and that it was a
"crazy decision" to begin construc-
tion so soon.

The decision of whether or not to
halt construction will be reached
some time later this week. following
the cnvironmcntalstudy. l I

President Reagan first learned of
the bombing from news accounts
on early morning television ncws
