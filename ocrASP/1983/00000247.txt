APRIL I9, I983 n ALBANY STUDENTPRESS 

u.s. Embassy blasted In Beirut, Lebanon

<Front Page
States is mediating talks aimed at
getting Israeli. Syrian. and Palesti-
'nian forccs out of Lebanon.
Special U.S. envoys Philip C'.
Habib and Morris Draper were in
thc prcsidciitial palace ﬁve miles
away at the time of the explosion.
but Draper's wife was visiting the
embassy and he raced back to the
compound to scorch for her. A
U.S. Murine said she was taken to a
hospital with cuts on the temple.

The bombing was the worst at-
tack against a U.S. target In
Lebanon. and a pro-Iranian tcr-
rorist group. Moslcm Holy War.
claimed responsibility. telling the

newspaper Al Llwa. “This is part of
the Iranian rcvolution’s campaign
against imperialist targets
throughout the world. We shall
keep striking at any Imperialist
presence in Lebanon, including the
multinational forcc." Moslcm Holy
War has claimed several previous
attacks on the multinational force.

President Reagan denounced the
bombing Monday as “a cowardly
act.“ and pledged that it will not
dctcr the United States front pursu-
ing pcrtcc in the Middle East.
Rcagun said it was apparent that
some Americans were among the
casualties. "but we don't know yet
the cxact number or tltc extent of
injury."

President Reagan first learned of
the bombing from news accounts
on early morning television news
shows. Spcakcs said. The president
was then briefed by telephone at
8:00 am. by national security ad-
viser William P. Clark. who had
lalkcd by telephone with Dillon.

U.S. Ambassador Robert Dillon,
who was preparing to jog when the
bomb went off and was In a jogging
suit. escaped from the ritbblc of his
top-floor office by climbing out on-
to a balcony. lhcrt rc-cntcring on a
lower floor. He suffered minor cuts
and said thc bomb-laden vehicle
may have crttahcd through a bar-
ricadc. i
