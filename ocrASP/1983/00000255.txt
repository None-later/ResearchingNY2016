Albany winter wash away into the sewer and sink back in-
to the dank earth. The end of the semester now looms
conspicuously over the horizon; a blinding, blistering inferno of

‘- s the sun radiates above us, the last vestiges of another

mounting academic pressure forms an aura towards which one is
lnexorably drawn. Jutting menacineg through the glare. dark and
ominous. marching ever closer with unquestionable certainty and
casting a shadow so dark over the entire landscape that it throws
all that stands before it into an impenetrable abyss
stands. . . . . FINALS WEEKl

As we begin to bear down once again for the final showdown. it
seems a most propitious occassion to step back one last titnc and
look beyond narrow conﬁnes of calculating that magical number
which will arise out of the tumult of the mid-May madness. Tlte at-
titudes which tend to overtake students. especially during these last
few weeks. reveal the misconceptions we may ltold concerning our
education, our futures. and our place In the world which we are
preparing with such ardor attd zeal to become a part of.

Now that the recent Stttdcnt Association. Central Council. attd
various class elections are over and done with. many students
believe that they can return to their lives in peace. and that the
school will function for tltetn wlth little distttrbattcc. providing the

services and activities they desire at the appropriate moments.
After all. when we leave SUNYA behind. it will be our grades. not
SA or Central Council, which will follow us from ctty to city and
determine the course of our lives. right? ‘

There is no denying that an attitude is cultivated at this untversi-
ty which focuses almost obsessively on choosing a career and
securing a place for oneself in this dog-eat-dog world. Thts process
of limiting ourselves so severely. however. is a two-way street. and
its long term affects can be detrimental.

Leading a successful and fulfilling life as a student involves
more than preparing oneself exclusively for the job market. To
shut out the wealth and variety of opportunities for self explora-
tion and expression which lie before us now amounts to nothing
short of self-betrayal. As one Albany professor reminds his
students each year. "Don‘t let school interfere with your educa-
tion." There are many other qualities and skills which are at least
as important as choosing tltc rigltt tnttjor. or pttlllttg good grades.
Limiting your scope and awareness of the world outside your
courses and career tttcatts tltat you are ttot doing justice to fulfill-
ittg your potential as a hutnatt being. Attending a university pro-
vides us a unique opportttnily to explore. and experiment wlllt our
intellects. politics. and ideals. Most importantly. we are able

through this process to develop our self-awareness. inner strength
and understanding of ourselves and the world in which we live
And in the long run. it is this other cducatiott which often deter.
mines the course of our lives.

So in between casting your vote and burying yourself in lite
books. reﬂect for a moment on the meaning artd itttputluncc or
both. Your only concern here should not be your grades. There it a
great deal more within the confines of Perimeter Road than
classrooms and a library. Only if you avoid lltttl grndt‘s/t‘att‘cts
oriented tunnel vision. and instead develop your rich and ditcttc
potential as a student. will you truly receive an cdttcatiotr.

Just as tltere is more to being a studettt tltatt getting good mm.“
there is more to becoming a successful human bcittg tltatt mating a
good living. As the world becomes more fast-paced. morph-t, and
impersonal. it takes a greater effort on tltc part of art-“0.... m

Though supposedly the party which represents the work-
ing class and minorities, the recent Chicago mayoral elec-
tion only proved that the Democratic party represents little
but its owrt self-serving interests.

in a city heavily populated with voting Democrats and
controlled by the Democratic machine at all levels of
politics. the defection to the Republican candidate was
sizeable and signiﬁcant. Matty a Democratic city alderman
transcended conventional party lines and swung their sup-
port away from black Democratic candidate Harold
Washington toward the opposition party candidate.
Republican Bernard Epton.

[Ebert Martiniano

Ostcnsibly. local aldcrmcn clnintcd this switch in support
was made to preserve Chicago's Democratic machine. tltc
controlling factor irt Chicago politics for decades.
Washington publicly stated he would dismantle Chicago's
machine if elected. That obviously tltrcutcncd tltc political
desires of matty a person.

 

 

liut for whatever reason given. the clcctiott fragmented
the Chicago Democratic party and stratified its voting
populace. While Epton was courting Chicago's scared
wltitc Democrats. Washington and company were or-
chestrating a mass voter registration which would ultimate-
ly propel Washington ittto the mayoral scat. '

If Chicago aldermcn were naive and sclt‘-serving. the re-
maining Democrats in the nation wcrc cttnning and self-
serving. In hopes of combining a hot political issue — race.

presidential politics. l984 presidential ltopcfttls marched

hand-in-hand with Washington declaring and
demonstrating undying support for Washington. a fellow

Democrat. and minorities throughout this great nation.

in actuality. Mondale, Glenn. and company took their
campaigns to Chicago to save what is left of the Democratic
Party‘s image. to attract media attention. and to attract the
black vote to, first. their campaign. and sccortdly. tltc
Dcmocratic Party.

At face value. these candidates did accomplish their
goals. With tltc result of Washington cking out a victory
over Epton. a minority tncmbcr of the Democratic Party
won an election. another Republican bit the dust. tnorc
people become registered Democrats. and the Dcntocratic
presidential carttlidtttcs drew attention to their candidacics.

On a gut level. howcvcr, tltc campaign in Chicago and
the accompanying tnttd slinging and rttcittl slurs scvcrcly
hamstruttg tltc Democratic Party's irttagc as an all-
cncompassittg party attd one which trttly champions tltc
causc(s) of tire working person. Though the opposition
alluded to race as alt clccliott issue. the defection of lltc old
party littc Democrats accentuated lhc problctn to tire cx-
trcme.

A political party cannot consider itself a trttc represen-
tative of tltc people when a faction of that party defects to
tltc opposition over an issue which supposedly binds it. One
issue which is binding. supposedly. in the Democratic party
is its cotttmitmcnt to the working class. irrcgardlcss (sic) of
race. or religion. or gcrtdcr. or economical status.

That cotnntittncrtt cannot be paraded before tltc clcc-

toratc just during an clcctiort year and tltctt closctctl tot lilL‘
remaining off-election ycars. Furthermore. any \totitttg
class issue cannot be relevant just during clcction little and
inconsequential for the remaining weeks prior to and ytthyc
qucnt to the election. The party then becomes one of op-
portuttity ratltcr than one of substance.

John Stuart Mill wrote that tltcrc exists two (Mics oi
political animals — one cautious in actions and one hold in
actions. Consequently. political parties follows-ti liittl tii\i-

thougltt only one political party should exist er ottc party
