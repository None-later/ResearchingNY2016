tudent aid hearing

To the Editor:

The 1983 budget battle proved to be a success for SUNY
tudcnts with 39 million dollars and over 2.000 position ems
cstorcd to the State University System. The quality of our
ducution has been saved. but a $300 tuition‘incrcnse rc-
ains tr stark reality as a roadblock to accessible higher
ducation. in the wake of cscniating college costs. shifting
riorities in education and the dismantling of equity laws.
reduction in federal ﬁnancial aid is an important concern
which needs to be addressed.

The majority of college students depend upon financial
assistance through grants. loans and work-study. More
than six-million students. 60 percent of the college popula—
tion. rely on ﬁnancial aid programs. Between fiscal year
1980 and 1983. student aid programs have been reduced by
(.5 billion dollars despite soaring inﬂation and record
unemployment.

The drastic cutbacks of the eighties call for consumer
contribution on the nature of financial rtid. On May 2.
SASU will be sponsoring federal aid financial aid ltcarirtgs
on 11": SUNY at Albany campus. it is an opportunity for
students to “scund off" about tltt: aid system in addition to
providing recommendations for improvements. irr humutt
terms. it is also a chance to relay rcztl-lifc struggles cx-
pcricnccd by students and their families in meeting higit col-
lege costs.

The rcsults of tltc financial aid hearing will bc compich
with it national report which will be distributed to officials
ill the Department of Education. members of Congress and
higher education policy makers. iiopcftrlly. this report will
be used to shape financial aid policies irr ti rcatrlltori/tttion
proccss scheduled to begin this summer.

Students. administrators and financial aid personnel can
help change the course of student financial aid. SASU
tvttttts to hear about your problems concerning firrttrtcitll
limitations ntld your ftrtttrc at SUNY. Sign up to testify tor
the itcrlrirtg at SASU. Call 465-2406 for additional informa-
tion.

ing non-stop.

Second. the beer. Because the legal drinking age in NY
state excludes some of our younger audience members from
obtaining beer. double proof of age must be presented at
the show. Different color wristbands will be distributed to
distinguish the drinkers from non-drinkers. Of course. soda
and food will be served to all. and for free. by UAS.

Third. the buses. The day of the event. May 7. extra
buses will run thc Alumni and Wellington routes to deliver
our off-campus and Alumni Quad friends to and from the
uptown campus. if you expect to drink. accept our offer
and please ride the buses. Don't ruin a fantastic afternoon
by driving drtrnki

Fourth. thc fireworks. Last year. UCB and SA sponsored
the first Post-Celebration Fireworks Extravaganza. This
year's fireworks display promises to bc bigger and bcttcrl it
begins at 8:00 p.m. over the football field.

Last. the tickets and fences. Tickets will be sold to tax
card holders only. bcginning‘Tucsday April 26 in the Cam-

You‘d think by iron the ASP would be ready to admit
that maybe there is something wrong with its" SA clttlotsc-

without bias. who the best candidates are. For those who
hold the opinion of the ASP in high regard. the ASP’s opi-
nion will be ever present on the editorial page.
This suggestion scents practical enough to several people
i'vc spoken to. l await the ASP’s opinion.

Due to the fact that students are generally unfammar
with the candidates wefeli the need for more room than the
Edltori‘al page would allow. All subjective judgements
made in the election supplement were clearly labeled either
endorsement or imminent. —-Ed

People and food

To the Editor:

The weekend of March 11-12 marked tltc date of
SUNYA's sixth annual CROP food first. This first is
organized by thc SA sponsored group. Pcoplc rtttd Food. i
would like to express my disappointment with the Asp for
providing no coverage of this event wltlclt irtvolvcd approx-
imatcly 400 students and missed over $2.400. This money is
to be distributed locally. nationally. and world-wide to help
the inrngry help themselves. Art activity that involves so
many students and tlttll is for such it worthy cause should
merit covcrngc in thc Asp. l wars told that the ASP reportch
bird previously assigned storics that they liittl to covcr and
therefore could not do it story on tltc first. The Tintcs-
Uttiott. Knickerbocker Ncws. and the South lirtd News all
found the first important enough to write articles trhout it.
so wiry shouldn't tltc ASI’?

As ottc ol~ llil.‘ orgtrttircrs ol’ the first I would like to thank
all tbusc who pttrticipalcd with special thanks to Sr.
Danicllc llottctti for all her guidance and support. Tlttlnk
you.

iii the mum: of lsr‘ttclis interest. lsr'acli defense and Israeli
might. Let us pr'otrrotc through open corrttntrnicaliott and
academic discussions. at least itt this campus; lltt.‘ ideas of
peace. Arid all together discourage the itlclts as well as
slrrltcgics of war. I would like the ASA to be equally
respected and encouraged by the university's officials; as
well as Jewish intellectuals: us far as giving to it (ASA) the
opportunity of “informing the public about Arab view
points." “free information." and presenting the Palesti-
trian problem as tbc ASA rtrcrltbcrs demand. 1 strongly
believe iii the possibility of peaceful and social co-cxistcrtcc
bctwccn Arabs and .icws. So. an open corttrnlrrtictttion bct-
wccrt Arab and Jewish students. at present. is dcsirabc and
reqttcsittbic to work otrt their differences. Alitl illcgal tic-
liotts or an equal trettlrtrcnt are ucccptablc as far as what
this institution stands l'or. SUNYA its an academic institu-
lion stands for high and noble objectives. We as its students
must not only rcspcct its rtoblc ohjcctives bttt also relic-ct
and adhere to these objectives. its students we should not
call sorrrcbody we lllhttgicc with “it pithliittlt‘. :t tcrrorist.“
and so on and so forth.
