American politics may seem

Sarracco commented that Coun-

PRISA a zero appropriation.

In his defense of l’RlSA's fun-
ding. Corso maintained that the
programs PRlSA has planned are
“absolutely educational," etting
:ap sessions, irtforrnation sessions,
urd newsletters as some of the
things i'RlSA has planned for this
year.

PRISA member Jose Rossy told
the all-white Council durirtg the
brrdgct hearings that he could not
understand their "inscnsibility."
i“We cannot turn on a radio and
listen to otrr music. We cannot pick
’up a newspaper and read about our
news. Hopefully you (Council) will

gain some insight into what it is to
toe a minority in Albany." he said.

Fromm noted that problems
Council had in dealing with PRISA
were only one example of a lack of
communication with minorities. He
cited problems with the Chinese
Student Association's budget as
lanother example.

“Tire members of Central Coun-
cil don‘t have a full understanding
of the problems that minority
students on this campus face and
because of that less-than-full
.mderstanding they often don't give
the minority student the same
credibility. the same respect. arid
the same treatment that they give
other groups." Fromm stated. ad-

want them to meet my new boyfriend. He‘s a fabulous

could be really popular someday if he could just get a
little financial backing from someone like Daddy and a
few of his partners in the firm. So we've decided to ask
