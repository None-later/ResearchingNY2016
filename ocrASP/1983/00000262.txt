AMIAIWIRA season in jeopardy

B Bar Getfner

For the second year in a row an unexpected spring

snowstorm has taken its toll on the AMlA/WIRA

softball season. The inclement Weather has caused the

postponement or cancellation of almost every outdoor

 

 

 

LOIB MATTABONI UPS

The AMIAIWIRA softball season is In danger of
being cancelled.

s ort.

pFor AMiA/WIRA. the snow and rain has caused
the cancellation of over 230 games, or roughly 70 per-
cent of the games scheduled to date. With 220 games
remaining in the schedule. 230 games to make up and
only 350 time spots for fields left open. this causes u
very serious problem. This problem has led to talk
about cancellation of the whole season.

Late last night the AMiA council met to decide
possible ways in solving the softball crisis. Thrcc possi-
blc solutions were suggested. The first was to simply
cancel the season. The second was to just continue the
scason frorn where the schedule left off. or cunccl tht
season and have a softbnll tournament for arty tcums
that want to enter. The tournament would most likely
be a single elimination tournament. “Wc budgeted for
35 percent rainouts. but when you have 70 percent. our
hands are tied. there is nothing we can do." u disup-
pointcd AMlA President Mike ilrusco snid.

If the season is continued. games would be schcdul.
ed up to the reading day May 10. excluding Saturday
May 7th for Celebration '83 and most of Sunday for
cleanup. The key for thc softball season lies in this
weekend's games. if the games get cancelled. the pro-
spcct of a complete scuson looks very dim.

“i think it would not be fair to cancel the season. a
tournament would be the best for everyone." said
Kevin Black. captain of inside Sylvia Again. “The best
thing would be at single climinutiorr tournament. it's
better to have something than to have nothing." corn-
mcntcd .llm Robertson. pitcher. inside Sylvia Again.
Downtown softball pluycr lid Klobus said.
“Downtown shortened their season, so why can't thcy
do that uptown'l if they can‘t. i like the idcu ofu single
elimination tournament."

Although niost pluycrs were upset about the fact
that the season might be cttnccllcd. the feeling was they
would rather pluy a single clirninntion tournumcnt

hon ploy nothing.

One note on the lighter side was given by Rubuu
illight's Don Bnriccvac. He suid. “Snow is nice, but it
makes fielding und base running very difficult." l 1

Flock captures State Sectionals

By Adam Kuyc

,___._,.___._d_____l.___.__

The Albany State ultimate frishcc team emerged vic-
torious at the upper New York State Sectional cham-
pionships held in Luke Scuecu park in Geneva NY. on
April 16-l7. For the first time in their history. the
team, dubbed The Flock. grabbed the top spot in this
bi-annual tournament. Playing in adverse conditions
ranging from blustery winds to a slow muddy field.
The Flock combined defensive strategy with a
deliberate offense on their way to an impressive 5-1
record for the tourney. lifting their season record to
10-1.

Oswcgo was Albany's first opponent on Saturday
morning. Oswcgo. a large and very physical learn. was
overpowered by Albany. who was victorious by a score
of 15-5.

Next. Albany faced Cornell. a team whom The
Flock was very wary of. considering Albany's loss to
them in the Area Championships last fall. Albany.
with an explosive offense led by Jon Gewirtz and Fred
Mitron, exploded with the first 3 points. This. combin-
cd with a fine defensive effort by such players as Chris
Braun and Dave Schwartz. led Albuny to a l3-9 vic-
tory.

The last game of the day pitted Albany against
SUNY Buffalo, who was ranked number three in the
section last fall. Despite Buffalo’s efforts. they went
down to The Flock. whose right zonc defense. led by
Captain Tom Prato. clamped down on the usually cx.
plosive Buffalo offense. giving The Flock a 15-9 vic-

tory.

The first game on Sunduy saw Alhuny facing the on-
ly remaining 3-0 tcum. Syracuse, the team which
Albany considered their greatest threat. due to their
skill and speed. th Albany proved to be more than a
match for Syracuse. as they downed their opponents in
a close, exciting game. by u score of l()—ii. Albuny now
stood alone at 4-0.

Albany had to win their next game to insure their
nunrbcr onc spot. They faced R.l.T.. a new team,
whose record up to that point stood at 3-1. with only a
heart breaking double overtime loss to Syracuse the
day before. Despite their little known ability. R.l.T.
played an exceptional game, and handed Albany their
only loss of thc scctiorruls by a score of lS-IO.

Albany knew that the last game was crucial if they
were to slay high in the rankings. The Flock faced the
host team. Hobart, who also sported u 4~l record.

Led by a spectacular defensive effort by Mark
Papcrno, the team's spiritual guru. the Flock hundin
beat Hobart by a score of l6-lO.

Other exceptional performances were given by Scott
Lindcnaucr. Andy Eras and Mike Wutsky, to name a
few.

Because of Albany's finc performance, they advance
to the Regional Championships in Purchase on April
23-24, with teams represented from all the New
England States and New York. The Flock will have to
place in the top eight in that tourney in order to qualify
for the Eastern Collegiate Championships which take
place the following weekend. i l

“We are a club. not a team. ever
though we're the only athletic
organization hcrc at SUNYA play-
ing against Division l opponents."
Volleyball club member Keith
Rudich said.

"We lost our varsity standing
three years ago and because of this
we only receive $2.000 from the
athletic department. as compared to
the football and basketbull teams,
which receive $40,000 each a your,"
he added. “We are last in line for
practice time and we have to pay for
a lot of things — transportation.
mculs, and uniforms — out of our
own pockets: things which are all
provided for the football and
basketball team members."

in addition, thc team has lost its
NCAA status and cannot cornpclc
for the national championship doc
to their club standing.

Captain Bryan Suttcrlcc uttcrcd
similior sentimcnts. “We're being
held back by the University‘s
refusal to acknowledge us as a varsi-
ty tcum. lftlicy. the athletic dcpuri»
rncnt. are really interested in pro-
rnoting school athletics tltcy should
take a look at our program."

“if we got the proper funding we
could he more competitive. but in-
stead they rcfusc to acknowledge us
at all. in their minds we do not ex.-
tst, and this has caused bud fccllngs
between us and the athletic depart-
ment." he concluded.

'Hcad football coach and former
Director of Athletics Bob Ford
sees the situation in it different
light. "The reason why the team
lost its varsity status was that the
sport, vollcybuli. became popular at
the sumc time that Title lX was in-
troduced. whose purpose was to
give womcn iiii opportunity to corn-
pctc in college uihlctics. At that
lrrrtc we had only seven fcmnlc
teams as compared to 28 male
teams. so something had to go. Not
only did we have to drop men’s
volleyball hut men's cross country.
They still get to use the gym,
however, both for pructiccs and for
games." he concluded.

‘ thn the [cum was first dropped
in status from :1 team to a club.
scvcrul of the team mcmbcrs ut-
tcmptcd to try out for the women's
volleyball team. l-‘ord. howcvcr.
who til the timc wus the Athletic
Director. I‘cl‘uscd lo Icl them try out
prompting one player. 'l‘om l.cttlry.
to file it complaint with tltc ()l'ficc

of Civil Rights. Department of
Education in which he claimed that
the school had used Title IX
discrimination against him. An in-
vestigation followed but in the end
it was the school. not Lcuhy. who
won out.

“The case was decided in out
favor due to the fact that there had
ncvcr been a history of dcprcvntion
of men's athletics at our school,"
Ford remarked. "if there had been
thcn the mcn could have tried out
for the women's team."

The club ﬁnished this your in the
Top [0 in the East for the second
year in a row while playing against
.uch powerhouses us Yulc. Hor-
vurd. Pittsburgh and Princeton.
“We are a very successful learn. one
of the most successful here at
SUNYA." Suttcrlcc remarked,
“but we could be even more suc-
ccssful.“

Rudich ugrccd. stating that
"Willi ull ottr problems on (in-
juries) and off (funding) the field
we did very well."

'l‘lic club has lropc tltut sornctimc
in the near futurc they will be given

benefits than go with it. "I cannot
see that huppcning in the near
future. but who knows,“ Ford said.
