.Pay increases of faculty declining in
colleges and universities nationwide

WASHINGTON. D.C. (CPS) College and university

administrators received average pay increases of only
6.4 percent this academic year. compared to to percent
and 8.7 percent pay hikes in the previous two years. an
administrators' association has found.
I This year's smaller salary increases “are probably an
lindication of what is to be expected over the next few
lyears." says Stephen Miller, executive director of the
College and University Pcrsonncl Association. which
.conducts the annual salary study.
‘ 0f llii: 93 positions survcvcd. executive rind ad-
ministrative ofﬁcers got the biggest pay increases-8.9
percent and 7.9 percent. respectively.

Studcui affairs administrators. on the other hand.

'cccivcd the .smnllcsi salary increases. 4.2 pcrccnt.'

‘ollowcd by ttcttdcmic iil'l'iiirs officers with 6.5 percent
'iiiscs.

“With declining cnrollmcnis tllld the ongoing
cconomic problems collcgcs iirc facing. I think at
slower rate of salary incrciiscs will hi: the norm for iii
leiisi the next few yours.“ Miller says.

"In icrnu.~ of ii carccr in higher education. though. it
may mean good people will be leaving the profession.

and that could cause some real problems in the
future."

Community college administrators fared best this
year. averaging 6.5 percent more than they made last
year. Ofﬁcers at large universities were close behind
with 6.2 percent increases. trailed by four-year college
administrators. who netted only 4.7 percent pay raises.

Private school administrators. for the first time in
recent years. rcccivcd smaller pay increases—5.6 per-
cent compared to 6.6 percent—than their public school
colleagues.

Of all administrators surveyed. deans of medicine
rcccivcd the highest salaries. $86,700. followed by law
school deans at $67,787.

Nursing administrators at studcnt health centers
made the Icast at $I6.64(). followed by bookstore
directors at $l8.740.

Women and minorities continue to hi: the lowest
puid administrators. Compared to their white male
counterparts. women carn 44.8 percent less and
minorities make 37.2 percent less. the study shows.

Miller says it number ol‘ factors. such its length of
employment. could explain the disparity between
minority and non-minority salaries. Z

U.S. research money stretched

WASHINGTON. D.C. (CPS) I-‘cdcrul icsciucli sup-
port for tho nation’s colleges rind universities will “just
about kccp price with irritation" next year. despite the
Reagan administration's proposed Ill percent increase
in overall research funding. it new study shows.

Most of Hit Iii percent increase in federal rcscttrch
money "won’t t‘VL‘ll bc seen by colleges and univer-
sities." but will insicad go to private corporations.
sttys Albcrt Tcich. co-iiuthor ol‘ the Ariicricim Associa-
tion for the Adviiiiccmcni of Science's iiiiiiuiil study of
rcsciirch and development funding.

Support for college and univcrsity research will in-
crease 4.7 pcrccnt next your. according to the study.
amounting to a $236 million increase in real dollars.
But in constant dollars. funding will rise only one-half
of one percent. or by SIO million.

“A lot of people are talking about the big l8 percent

increase the iidiiii'mstrutiou llllS proposed for overall
research funding." 'I'cich notes.

“But colleges and universities won't lure nearly as
well its the private scctot. Most of that money will go
to corporations like IItc big aerospace firms."

Within the overall $7 billion incrcusc. moreover.
funding for defense rewrier will increase by nearly 28
percent. while basic icsczirch funding will get only it 5.5
percent increase in constant dollars.

Funding for uniycisily tchctll'clt through the deport-
mcnts of Agriculture. Commerce. Interior. Education.
and the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion will actually decrease. the study points out.

And the National Institutes of Health. which chan-
nel nearly $2.] billion in research money to colleges.
will suffer a ncuriy two percent cut in federal support if
Congress approves Reagan's funding requests. I'l
