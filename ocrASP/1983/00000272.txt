After ten years of college, Cheri
McKently is getting a little depress-

ed.

Even after she gets her masters
degree in industrial social work next
fall from the University of Wiscon-
sin, she doesn't think she has much
of a chance to land a decent job.

“i don't have any hope of getting
that 525.000 a year job," says the
38-year-old mother of two, who
holds down a part-time job at the
university's Continuing Education
service.

In her job, she gets to see increas-
ing numbers of people in situations
like hers: recent college grads who,
after periods of trying but failing to
parlay their degrees into the jobs
they were trained for. are now
lowering their sights and expecta-
lions.

it is happening at similar continu-
ing education and retraining offices
around the cottntry, too.

“Tire people coming in for
counseling are in their twenties and
thirties. and they feel angry.
frustrated and beirayer ," says Kent
Lcsandrini. a UW career counselor.

Especially among rccctrt grads,
“i think there is disenchantment.

State University's associaic platin-
ing dircciot'.

Poor grades
may lose aid

WASHINGTON, D.C. ((‘l’Si The
government will soon t'orcc colleges
to strip students with had grades of
their fcdctal financial aid, at least if
a congressional advisory committee
gets its way.

The National Commission on
Student Financial Assistance,
crcatcd three years ago to draw tip
sluderrt aid bills for Congress. last
Week recommended a series of new
academic rules that colleges would
have to impose on aid recipients.

Colleges. the commission said,
often don't take aid away from
students who don’t make “satisfac-
tory academic progress" toward
their degrees because of bad grades.

The proposed new rules are “an
attempt to get (schools) to make it
clear to students what the standards
are." adds Ton Wolanin, an aide to
commission member Rep. William
Ford (D-Mi).

In January, 1982, the Govern-
ment Accounting Ofﬁce (GAO'
estimated that as many as 45 per-
cent of the nation's college aid of-

,. frees may not monitor aid reci-
‘, plcnts' grades at all.

Among the 5800 transcripts the
GAO surveyed in I982. it found

open the doors." says Dr. William
Bryan of the University of
Alabama's Continuing Education
Program. “But it Is not."

Students and recent grads “have
seen a pretty hard decade for
employment," summarizes Paul
Barton, head of the National in-
stitute for Work and Learning in
Washington, D.C. “These people
don‘t see themselves doing as well
as their parents. and that is part of
the disappointment."

“There is a feeling that people
are not in control of their future,"
Lcsadrini explains.

He sees post-graduate depression
most often among liberal arts
degree holders like teachers and
social workers. but also among a
surprising number of people who
have earned their masters of
business administration (MBA).
MllAs. of course. were considered
the golden job ticket of the late
seventies.

Part of the reason for the
widespread disappointment and the
increasing traffic at continuing
education programs frorn recent
grads is that students treat their
educations too tnucit as crrtploycnt
tools. the counsciors say.

"l’coplc rely too much on critical-
iiott as a singular qualification for
employment," (iutnbcnct cort-
tcttds. "The total lacing anti irnngc
put forth arc Inorc llllpllllillll.”

tious atcn't illL‘ L‘thlL‘itth' lault. thc
ctlncalots say.

“I don't think anyone ever pro-
mises anyone a position,“ says Dr.
William Barton of the Unvlersity of
Tennessee's continuing education
program and vice president of the
nationwide Association for Conti-
nuing Higher Education.

San Diego State's Oumbeer also
attributes the palpable “disillusion-
ment" among the recent grads she
sees to the current recession.

Her clients “are tremendously
frustrated because the job oppor-
ttrnities are not the same as they
were three years ago."

Alabama‘s Bryan says brining
down the state's 16 percent
unemployment rate would go a long
way toward improving people's
moods.

Brit Williard Wirtz of the Na-
tional institute for Work and Lear-
ning says touch of the
undcremploymcnt and depression
among recent grads can be traced to
a fundamental shift in the
Atncrican economy, not just to a
tcrrrporaty recession.

"This has always happened"
when ccottotnic activity mvocs front
one base (say ngriculturc) to
another (industry), he points ottr.
“'I‘ltc disillusionment is nothing
new."

Graduates lowering sights as iobs get scarce

"The computer. the chips and
robots are coming in," he says.
“Those with degrees from a couple
of years ago are ﬁnding it difﬁcult
to compete in the higher techniogy
)f the eighties."

Whatever the reasons for the
disillusionment. they are prompting
a remarkable enrollment boom at
the continuing education ofﬁces

and especially technical schools
around the nation. .
"We’re experiencing an Inor-

dinate number of dcgreed students
coming back." exuits Robert L.
Brown, admissions director for
Wake Technical College in Ralicgh,
N.C.

Wakc's enrollment is up 42 per-
cent ovcr fall, I98l.

"I turned away 1,000 students
last fall." he reports, "I‘m afraid
I’m going to be turning away 2,200
this year." Many of them have
Ph.D.s and MBAs, he adds.

“We have a lot of students with
four-year degrees coming back" for
retraining at Central Texas College.
says Lillian Young of the Kiliecn
school's Skills Training Center.

They tell her, “‘I'vc gone frm
onc place to another. atrd i can't
find a job.”' site says. Many of the
:ollcgc grads are now in ("It's auto

mechanic, medical technician,
welding, diesel mechanic and
building maintenance programs.

Technical school enrollment na-
tionwide has gone up 20 percent
over the last two years, in part
because of the inﬂux of college
grads, reports Christopher Davis of
the Natioal Association for Trade
and Technical Schools.

He says most to them are enroll-
ing in data processing. electronics.
dental technician and drafting
technician programs.

The programs “Make them more
marketable for entry-level jobs," he
explains.

But unreconstitutcd liberal arts
majors like McKentiy see a
dcterminedly-downbeat future.

“I‘m facing a job market that
doesn‘t want social workers," she
says. After starting business school
she married and had children before
returning to college for her ILA. in
social work. Her one social work
iob fell victim to a budget cut. After
a divorce, site returned to Wiscon-
.in for her masters.

Evert with the advanced degree,
the fears she won’t be able to get a
good job, or hold onto one if the
economy goes sour again. i t
