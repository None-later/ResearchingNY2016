Campus child-care facilities will
receive a boost In their operational
budgets if legislation that would
provide a maximum of $10,000 per
facility is adopted.
I The proposal. sponsored by Ken-
neth P. LaValle. chairman of the
Senate Higher Education Commit-
tee, is designed to increase the
capacity of established centers and
to provide the impetus for addi-
tional ones. according to the bill
memo. The money would be a one-
time grant.

Richard Santoro. program direc-
tor for LaValle. said that the pro-
posal has been circtilated among
various people close to the day-care
issue for input, and that a joint
hearing is being planned to help bet-
ter understand the issue.

The State Education Department
indicates that there are more and
more women going to school in
need of such services." Santoro
said. According to Saiitoro. a
similar bill is being worked on by
Assemblyman Mark Alan Siegel,
who chairs the Assembly lliglier
liducatiori Committee.

Istudenls attending college has iti-

Nixon library

(CPS)-One school has at last of-
l‘ered to let Richard Nixon build a
presidential library on its campus.

The Faculty Council at Cal State-
liiillerton has voted 35—l to submit a
bid to the Nixon archive founda-
tion. which previously has tried to
place the library at Duke and then
at the University of California-
Irvine.

l-'ti|lerton's students government
board unanimously approved mak-
ing a bid for the library a few days
before the faculty voted oti it. ac-
cording to campus spokesman .lcrry
Keating.

The former president is expected
to decide which bid to accept - he's
received bids from Whittier anti San
Clemente in California. and
Abilene. Leavenworth and Shawnee
Ill Kansas as well as Fullerton -
soruetitiie in April.

Keating says the foundation
wants to decide itt time to get the
proposal to Congress this "ssioti.
before Fullerton
made its bid. Cal-lrvirie lost its
chance when the acaderriic Senate
“wanted a little riiore time to
study" the idea. reports Helen
Johnson, Irvine's public informa-
tion director.

She says some faculty members
were “partieiilary concerned with
the idea of a museum (attached to
the library) that would glorify Nix-
on...

But taking tiiore time to decide if
it wanted the library and museum
would have meant Congress could
not act this year. .lohnsoii says. so
the Nixon Foundation asked Irvine
to forget hosting them.

creased the need for campus-based
child-care centers. according to
Phyllis Bader-Borel, director of the
Community College Program
Development.

During the 1960‘s. says Bader-
Borel. there were few day-care
centers. This situation has changed
dramatically because the influx of
non-traditional students ——
housewlves, person changing their
careers. and people who. after
working for a number of years,
have decided to continue their
education. said liader-liorcl.

Presently, the State University of
New York provides space. utilities.
provisions for facttlty. and
maintenance for about lli campus-
opcrated centers and 17 community
college centers.

The majority of the dayieare
centers are licensed non-profit
orgatii/atiotis which depend largely
on donations and parental fees.
'l'liese fees, which would ordinarily
present a problem to student-
patents. are levied oti a sliding—scale

basis to help siibsidi/e these

The centers were originally

established to provide day-care for
children of students and faculty.

The same week (‘al~lr\'ice‘s t'aciilv

“The initiative for the library
came from the faculty." Kcating

Keatiiig credits the non-
coniroversial approval to the facul-

historians' argument was that "you
