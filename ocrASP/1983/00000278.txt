Research may assist in diagnosis of infections ' .1

By Ellen Santaslero
STAI‘F WRITER ‘

The genetic research of David
Shub and Nancy Casna is “poten-
tially revolutionary," according to
Biology Department Chair Henry
Tedcschi. Through their efforts.
Shub. an assistant professor in the
biology department and Casna. a
Ph.D. student. their work “could
be applicable in the clineal
diagnosis of bacterial or viral infec-
tions.“ said Tedeschi.

According to Shub. he was
motivated to research the activity of
viruses on host cells because it was a
previously unstutlicd area of
genetics. "One of the things tltttt
has been left unexplained in
molecular genetics is a striking
pltcnutnetta itt viral activity. When
a virus erttcrs a host cell." said
Shub. "within two minutes all of
the host cell's ftntctious are switch-
ed off by the virus. The virus' DNA
takes over the machinery of the cell
and the virus' functions work full
speed ahead." he explained.

Sltub's study attempts to explain
this phenomena. “l mu interest in
setting up a general ntodel that
shows how one set of genes can take
over for attothcr set of genes.“
Shub said.

The procedure. described by
Shub. consists ot "turning the
tables" on the virus. The start
signal. a spot on the host cells’
DNA witerc the cell is taken over by
the virus, was discovered by Shub
amt (‘asna to be located at the
beginning of the host's genes. Shub
explained that by putting the host's
DNA into the beginning of the viral
gene. and continuing the virus'
growth. the viral genes start signal is
switched from replicating its own to
replicating that ol‘ the new cell
which is introduced into the virtts.

liy instilling another set of in
structions into the virus' DNA frotn
the new cell, the virus‘ damaging

proliferation is rendered inactive.
according to Shub. "if we can inac-
tivate the virus' discriminating
gene." he said, “we can stop
viruses from killing host cells."

This problem. according to Shub.
went unsolved for many years. but
new genetic engineering technology.
or gene splicing. "put a new tool in
my hand." he said. and enabled
him to carry out his experiment.
Shub explained that gene splicing
requires literally cutting parts of
genes and combining them with
other genes to obtain a desired end
product. Because the virus used in
the experiment, Bacteriophage T4.
is resistant to ordinary gene splicing
tcelutiques. Shub had to invent a
modification of the regular splicing
technique to conduct his experi-
tncnt.

All research. said Tedcschi. is
funded through federal grants. lie
emphasized that research is not
university funded and the resear-
chers mttst get their own grants.

Shub began considering this pro-
ject about three years ago. He
received a grant for $25,000 to pur-
sue it a year and a half ago from the
New York State Health Depart-
ment. lie has just received a grant
of $130,000 to continue his research
from the National Science Founda-
tion. Shub says he and Casna and a
small lab staff are trying to ﬁgure
out what they found from the first
part of the experiment. Most of the
viruses they experimented with
responded favorably, but a few
tntttants survived. Further rescarclt
will be directed at trying to find otlt
why the mutants didn't respond.
Shub adds that there could be ap.
plications of his findings bttt those
possibilities are still in the thinking
stages.

Shub describes himself as an ex-
treme example of a "reductionist"
biologist as opposed to a biologist
who studies the science holistically.

SUNY develops program to
draw graduate minorities

By Marlin Adams
NIH], I'Rl.\\' ‘tl Iti'lt'i"

A $l.3 million program to en-
courage more minority students to
enter graduate and professional
programs is in full swing after being
held up for nearly a year in the Divi-
sion of the Budget.

Tltc Afﬁrmative Action Program
for the Expansion of Minority
Students in SUNY Graduate and
Professional Programs was
developed a year ago. but has been
delayed until this year because of a
bureaucratic delay at the Division
of the Budget, according to Alden
N. Haffner. vice chancellor for
research. graduate studies and pro-
fessional programs.

The program is intended to work
in conjuction with existing pro-
grams on individual campuses. The
purpose of this effort, Haffner
says. is to increase the pool of
minority students qualiﬁed to suc~
ceed in a graduate or professional
program. Once these students have
been identified. their names will be
forwarded to individual campuses
with programs to meet their educa-
tional plans.

The 1983-84 Executive Budget
provides $57,000 for SUNY Central
Administration to coordinate attd
develop the centralized pool of
names to be referred to campuses.

The actual program provides
over $l.3 million in assistance to
minority and disadvantaged
students interested in graduate and
professional studies. The aid is
divided into two categories:

$600,000 for fellowships and
3.700.000 in tuition waivers.

At a recent meeting, minority
recruitment counselors front
around the state pointed out that
publicin and onc-to-one counseling
would be the best way to relate to
students and change their percep-
tions about graduate attd profes-
sional program opportunities.

"Minority students perceive
graduate and professional studies as
imposing and extensive, without
supportive money, thus. putting it
beyond their reach. We want to
dispell these misconscptious." Haf-
fncr said.

in order to reach the broadest
possible minority student audience.
the state will be divided into ltHS
geographic districts. in each district
a seminar and general meeting will
be held to bring together minority
students from both the private and
public colleges who are already
engaged in undergraduate pro-
grams.

Dr. Haffner believes that involv-
ing working professionals and
students already in graduate pro-
grams will act as an incentive to
students who have entertained

houghts about graduate school.

The central coordination of tltis
arogram. says Hat'fner, s solely for
the purpose of increasing the appli-
cant pool front which individttui
colleges can identify qualified
minority students. ultimately to
have tltcm recruited into specific
programs offered by the respective
college. [I]

chances of scientists coming up with
useful findings. Shub refers to the

Shub adds. "The discovery of

the simplest self-replicating unit.

phenotype. according to Shub.
Funding of research in "pure
science" is necessary. according to

 

Assistant Biology professor David Shub

“pure science.” One time out of
one thousand you're going to come
up with a useful ﬁnding."
Tedeschl added that new bio-tech
ﬁndings may be considered unim-
portant at their time of discovery.
However. as questions are raised.
he said the ﬁndings become ap-
plicable to practical problems. Ci
