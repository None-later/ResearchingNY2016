When Professor Barbara Rotun-
do Is not leaching English. she can
be found walking through
graveyards studying cemeteries.

What began as a hobby I5 years
ago. has made Rotundo a specialist
In rural cemeteries -— the type that
arose In the early 1830's as a place
for city dwellers to spend leisure
time and spend time near the graves
of relatives.

Rotunda explained that the study
of graveyards is best used to cor-
roborate historical evidence and to
update town records, census reports
and employment records. She said
that the historian can estimate dates
of immigration by scrutinizing the
names of the deceased and the dates
of the death.

“Death In the I800's was
Haunted," she said. “men and
women would wear black clothing
or a black armband after the death
of someone close. Since death was
socially acceptable and understan-
dable in earlier times. it was not a
skirted issue as it is presently." she
added . According to Rotunda. the
cemeteries “were the forerunners of
modern day parks. Without their
development we probably would
not have Central Park in New York
City. or for that matter. any large
urban parks." It was common for

families to take weekend outings to
these rural graveyards for picnics
and to escape the increasing conges-
tion of the cities during that time.
Rotunda explained.

The paramount example of the
rural cemetery. according to Rotun-
do. is the Victorian style Mt.

Graveyard study digs up'the past 

 

1th century hletorleal Shaker cemetery
The study Ls best used to corroborate historical evidence.

Auburn which is situated between
the Charles River and the road to
Watertown on Boston's outskirts.
Established in I83l. it is the first
such cemetery and started a
fashionable trend towards rurallty
which was later to become
characteristic of the majority of
19th century graveyards.

The topography of the “average
rural cemetery" was designed to ac-
centuate nature; it included bills.
trees. brooks and low headstone for
more of the park-like atmosphere.
she said. Later. low headstones
were a cost-effective measure re-
quiring little maintenance.

"The rural cemetery came at a
'ime of cosmopolitaness and a
general desire that burial become
more ecumenical. People of the
period believed that since they lived
as one within a democracy they
could certainly be buried as one in
the same graveyard." said Rotun-
do.
In the Capital District. Albany
Rural Cemetary (Established
1840's). Vale Cemetary in Schenec-

tady (IBS'I) and Oakwood
Cemetary of Troy. were all
established during the period and
reflect these characteristics.

City planners of lhe l830’s. said
Rotundo. moved many graves from
town plots to the newly created
rural sites: therefore. it is possible
to find stones from the l7th century
in cemeteries established in l830.

"Colonial headstones. by and
large are flat plaques adorned with
cherubs and angels. With improved
transportation (expanding network
of railroads). larger and more or-
nate stones were possible." noted
Rotundo. She continued. “first the
deeper relief of the neoclasslc 19th
century appeared. Secondly the
more professional three-
dlmensional stones of the 19th and
20th century appeared." she ex-
plained.

Rotundo's research has been
published in The Harvard Bulletin.
the Ethics Institute, Historical Col-
Vection. The Association for
Gravestone Studies, and The British
Journal of Garden History. f]

Aid hearings conducted by SASU

Documenting the effects of cuts
in federally funded student aid pro-
grams on US citizens and judging
tltc efficiency of the current
system's approach is the job of a
SASU sponsored ﬁnancial aid hear-
ing. Monday 10 am. in LG. 23.

Stating that “ﬁnancial aid is not
a privelege — it is a necessity."
SASU Charmian Neary. coor-
dinator of the hearing says that the
documenting of human difﬁculties

 

due to financial aid cutbacks will
balance the “ﬁnancial aid experts.
education bureaucrats. and well
placed inl‘luence-peddlars." who
usually ltave the greatest impact on
shaping a program.

“Students. however." Neary
says. “have the greatest stake in en-
suring that adaptions in the delivery
system do not move them further
away from the goal of access."

Of the nation's 6 million
students. 60 percent rely on ﬁnan-
cial aid. Neary notes. while $1.5
billion have been cut from pro-

The administration’s proposal to
do away with such aid as TRIO and
EOP. programs which assist
economically and/or educationally
disadvantaged students. will result
in “those with the least being hurt
the most." according to Neary.

The hearing is one of nine being
held in the country. Hearings in
Madison, Wisconsin; and Ann Ar-
bor. Michigan were conducted last
week. The United States Student
Association will present testimony
to Congress early this summer. D
