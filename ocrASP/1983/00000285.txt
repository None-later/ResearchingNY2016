In-depth screening

To the Editor:

I would like to thank the ASP for the insightful editorial
of April 26. which addressed the lack of security for women
at SUNYA.

Among other things. the editorial suggested that a pro-
blem that needs attention is the University Escort Service. i
would like to rc-cmphaslzc this and explain what the pro-
blem is.

As stated In the front page article of the same issue. men
who apply for work with the Escort Service do not go
through a screening process. Applicants are interviewed
and. because they are part of the work-study program. can
not be turned down unless they are known
"troublemakers." I would first like to question what con-
stitutes a “troublemakcr” and secondly ask how an inter-
viewer can possibly determine such a thing in so short a
time.

A case where this system obvioust backfired involves a
close friend of mine. Last year she had the misfortune to
live in the hallway of several disruptive. "troublcmaking"
men. At one point in the semester she was sexually harassed
by one of her incbrlatcd neighbors. She was later shocked
to find out that this same man worked for thc Escort Scr-
vice.

if these arc the kind of inert that will be "escorting" me
around campus at night. I think I'd rather walk aloncl

What i suggest is a thorough in-dcpth screening process
for cvary applicant as is necessary for applicants of otitcr
University Services (for example S-Quad Ambulance. Mid-
dlc Earth and Genesis). We wouldn‘t trust just anybody
with these important services where somcbody's physical.
emotional or sexual health might be in danger. Let's not
trust just anybody with tltc safety of women on campus!

-—-Clalrc Schneider

Live and let live

To the Editor:

in my two years at this university. i have 5ch1 more of
racism than I thought possible. and l have always given my
all to stop it at its sources — ignorance. misunderstanding
and unnecessary fear. But after rcading “Paul Krugcr’s"
appalling lcttcr (April 26). I wonder if all my efforts have
been in vain. The election of Harold Washington in
Chicago. the large turnout at last year's Anti-Apartheid
Rally at Blccckcr Stadium. the increased integration of
black and white music on WCDB —- all this gave me a feel-
ing that there was hope. that I might see different races and
cultures begin to accept each other during my lifetime.
Perhaps I might one day see the downfall of South Africa's
unique blend of racism and brutality. Apartheid. Reading
“Mr. Kruger's" letter. i wonder if 1'“ see that day.

“Mr. Krugcr." piacc yourself in South Africa for a mo-
ment (although you hardly seem able). You are an official
Colored. less than human. slightly more than animal. You
live in a shock that the government has told you is home. In
order to leave the area. you must have all your papers in
order. as you must in order to work or anything else. This is
stricter than in tire Soviet Union. it is more than likely that
you work in the mines. and so far for ten months a year you
live in a worker camp. away from your family. only to earn
a bare subsistence. and only seeing your family two months
a year. And if you should find tltc courage to stand up for
your inalicnablc human rights. you will undoubtably bc ar-
rested and suffer tltc fate of Stephen Biko —— “slipping in
the shower." meaning brutal and deadly beatings. A civiliz-
ed government indeed. Nazi Germany was so civilized.

Now tell me. “Mr. Kruger." tell me that this Is a life
worth protecting from the "threat" of the Soviets. Tell me
that all this is worth the Cape trade route and your "seven
strategic minerals." Are we being rewarded for turning our
backs on suffering millions? '

And the alternatives? Since we all know “that Africans
are utterly incapable of modern. civilized government."
what is the poor darkie to do? You've shown us the folly of
the “negro attitude." What we need now are the good old
days of slavery and lynchings. l have the repulsive feeling
that you would agree.

As for US policy. you have overlooked the obvious pro-
blem. The black majority will look favorable upon any
power that offers them change — in this case. the USSR
and not the US. As long as we continue to support the op-
pressive Johannesburg regime. we are killing ourselves
politically. socially. and morally. as Well as destroying our
:‘hranccs of ever moving towards favorable relations with

me.

If we are to live In a free. safe world. our first goal must
be to stop acting like little cltildrcn. playing Cowboys and
Indians with Russia. We must stop touring and hating each
other. and start behaving like human beings. We cannot
allow ourselves to sink to the level of tire ttnimai. the bar-
barian. And if you should think of me as a "subversive".
think again. I speak of the very principle upon which
America was founded. the rigltt of all tttcn and women to
Iivc and let live frccly.

Facts distorted

To the Editor:

in his article “A Look at tltc Palestinian Cuttsc". (ilcnn
Moncs sccms to show a great deal of ignorance and.
dclibcrntcdly distorted facts. And just a few points con il-
lustratc tltc degree of distortion. First, “Arab lcadcrs cn»
couragcd muclt of the local population to lcuvc. telling
thctn to clear the way for the invading Arab artnics. . ." i.-
nonscnsc. Second. “There has never been such a thing as in
state of Palestine at any timc in history in any place" and
that "l’ttlcstinc refers to a gcographical location. . .". sug-
gcsts that the writer should go and study history bcfon.
making this dangerous argument. Third. "King Hussein. u
Hashcmltc and not 1111 Arab". reﬂects tltc grcntcst ig-
norancc which the writer is suffering. Fourth. what kintl oi
logic is this: to kick ottt the Palestinians and force tltc other
Arab countries to accept them; and invite the chs and
Zionists from all over the world to come under different
slogans. Fifth. the writer speaks lies. and. to say the truth.
lie is talking the biggest lies and establishing vcry untruc
facts and realities. Finally. we cart ncvcr ttchicvc u peace in
thc Middle East and stop the massacres of thc innoccnt
Palestinian refugees as long as we follow this line of argu-
mcnt.

-.lon Druclter

Tltc first claim is basically an established propaganda.
Because the issue of Palcsiitrian rcfugccs bccantc a clcttr
fact in the eyes of the world opinion. and because it has

been on the ofiicial records of thc U.N.. the Zionist pro-

paganda started to justify its brutal actions. As far as ihc
second point is concerned. we should advise thc writer to
open the Bible. specifically in the Acts of the Apostles
whcrc tltcrc is reference to thc tcrtn “tilistinc”. It should
also be made known to tltc rcadcrs as well as the \vriicr that
Banau Hashcttt or l-ittsltcmitcs is one of the most famous
and noble Arab tribcs. If King Husscin or his father Ab-
dullah happened to behave wrongly which. of course. they
did. likc other Arab rcgimcs. that is because of tire

pressures from the British colonizcrs. The Palestinians are
not rejected by the Arab regimes as much as they are forced
by them to accept the conditions of (steel: the American
and lsracll peace plans. The Palestinians are not allowed to
orcscnt their own peace plan. As far as the time being is
‘oncerncd. the Palestinians are accepting the Idea of the
social coexistence with the Jews. But israel. by supporting
tome extremist factions i.c. Abu Nidal. Sans Hadsd. and
by applying the traditional policy of “divide and conquer".
is projecting the PLO as it terrorist group and Palestine as a
land with no people and therefore this land shall be given to
the Jewish people. especially the Zionists. who are
dominating the world.

Judo and safety

To the Editor: '

i would like to rcpond to the editorial of 26 April “Be
more of reality." This cditorinl carries the implication that
help will come miraculously from above or from some
other cxtcrnai sottrcc. Look again. . .tltc answer comer.
from within.

As the president of the Albany State Judo Club It is con-
tinually a surprise to tire why tnorc women do not pursue
martial arts. Martini arts wcrc dcvclopcd for self defense.
Our club enrollment is approximately 20 people. only US
are women. and of that only about I/2 cvcr stay with it for
a full semester. Rttrc is the female in judo that continues
onward. Yet. the l-‘ctninist Alliuttcc can boast “50 people.
mostly women" turning out for a rally against rnpc on cam-
pus. Sure martial arts involve sweating. a little physical cx-
crtion and dedication (is being raped a worse price to pay?)

if the university were to double tltc number of blue light
:mcrgcncy phones. . .ii would not stop a rape. The phones
allow a person to report a rape (uftcr tltc fact). You could
tlouhlc lltc uttchrsity police and student patrols and in-
cvitublc sotttconc will still be rupcd. What happens. when.
with all this security on campus you lind yourself not on
campus?

If women truly want to prevent rape titcy must be able to
stop the rapist. Improved safety measures and external cn-
t'orccntcnt will only serve to reduce tltc rate of crime. But is
that any consolation if the one person raped annually. . .is

you?

Freedom of ideas

To the Editor:

Yom Hashoa (Holocaust Remembrance Day) was
observed last week. It is a day to remember those who
perished in the Holocuast and to reaffirm that we will not
forget the lessons that terrible event has taught us. One
such lesson is the importance of protecting basic human
rights.

The rights to study ideas and to listen to and ask ques-
tions of others arc the foundation of both Jewish beliefs
and democratic sysictns. It is. therefore. sad to scc that
when u distinguishcd Isracii professor and retired Colonel.
Mcir Pa‘il. comes to Speak on the SUNY-Albany campus
the posters publicizing his appearance are torn down and
replaced.

On early Sunday. April 17th. 250 posters wcrc placed
around campus. By the time of the campus Yom Haslth
memorial service that evening. most of the postch wcrc
rcmuvcd and rcplaccd by another organization. 0n the next
day another 250 posters were placed around campus and
again rcmovcd by others.

Behavior like tearing dowtt posters is an affront to both
lcwish and dcmocratic values and is most disturbing \vltcn
perpetrated by those who profess to be defenders of flu:
chish faith. Dcpriving others of the right to study. “shut
and inquire just because one disagrees with the point of
View being offered is contrary to the very core of quish
teachings.

As live national faculty and student organizations rcccnt-
ly wrote in response to similar campus actions elsewhere,
“Unless there is freedom to speak and to reach. even fo
those with whom we differ on fundamentals. and unlcs;
there is freedom for all to listen and to learn. there can be
no true college or university no matter how fine the
buildings or modern the equipment." i would add that
Judaism is more than wearing a yamulkc or keeping kosher
it is a way of life that respects other’s right to study. listen
and inquire. Lest we forget.

Chairman, Students for Israel
