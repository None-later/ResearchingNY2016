"I remember about 20 years ago, sitting in a quiet room at my
house In lthaca thinking at how I fit Into the world." It was this
spark that Ignited Court a! Memory, a recently published collec-
tion to stories by novelist James McConkey.

McCenkey, a distinguished protessor of English at Cometl
University, and writer at several novels. a critical work on British
novelist EM. Forster, two collections 01 stories, and various
pieces in Hudson Review, The New Yorker, and Sewenee
Review, traveled from ithaca to Albany to comment on his new

Arab-Jewish sponsored debate

.<3

Palestinian people should be placed
squarely on the Palestinian leader-
ship. “No Palestinian leader in 70
years has had the courage to step
forward and act to compromise,"
he asserted.

Schocnman disputed the idea of
Israeli willingness to compromise.
"There isn't a scintillu of evidence
to suggest that any Zionist would
allow any kind of partition," he
said. “The Zionists call for some
kind of entity but not a state." he
said, “with lenders acceptable to
Israel and Israeli military posts for
30 years. What people would accept
terms like that in their own land?"

Quoting extensively from
documents he said were made by
prominent Zionist and isracli

leaders. Schocnman accused
Zionists of openly collaborating
with the Nazi regime of the l9305.

According to Schocnman, the na-
tional military organization, the
defensive arm of the Jewish people
itt Palestine, openly stated that a
“New Order in Europe was com-
putiblc with the true national
aspirations of Jews."

Following statements and
responses by both speakers. the
ﬂoor was opened to questions. At
that point the fragile atmosphere of
cordialin broke clown as hostile
questions were fired at both
speakers. Following one hostile ex-
change between Goldberg and an
Arab student, on the status of
Palestinians under Israeli occupa-
tion, the debate cndcd. l]
