Elway looks to the future

San Jose, Ca.
(AP) John Elway is an oil well waiting to be
lapped. He is the mother lodc of ti gold ntinc
whose rich vein is still to be assessed. He is
America's new sports superstar who has yet
to complete a forward pass or hit a ltotttc run
on a bigtimc professional stagc.
Yet. there he sits in San Josc. Calif., atop a
potential mountain of federal notcs. waiting

' to see whose millions—those of the Yttnkccs'

impulsive George Steinbrcnncr or some pro
football club hungering for a franchise savcr
— will purchase his rclativcly untcstcd skills.

No single individual in our memory has
commanded such attention at such an early
stage in his career as this 6-foot-4. 202-pound
passing wizard out of Stanford Univcrsity,
picked No. i in Tuesday’s National Football
League draft.

As Elway, in the driver’s scat. plays onc
against the other, tltc sports world around
him wonders and, in thc cttsc of his future
Ducts, fumcs.

“Whch in thc ltcll docs ltc conic off so
great?" growls Terry Bradshaw, ti IJ-ycttr
NFL veteran who has led tltc Pittsburgh
Stcclcrs to four Supcr Bowl championships.

Commenting on Elwtty’s rcluctttncc to play
With the cellar-dwelling Bttltimorc Colts. who
chose him in the NFL drttft. and rcports that
Elway's football asking pricc is $7 million for
“V0 years, Bradshaw. a $300,000 quntcrhuck,

adds:

“He says he wants to play on the West
Coast. then don‘t play. Lct itim play
baseball."

liaschttll is Elway's altcrntttivc if Baltimorc
docsn't strike a deal to his satisfaction. Sicin-
hrcnncr is waiting in tltc wings. with his check
book opcn. ready to give the kid a five-year
contract with an cscapc clause if he's not
happy.

Stcinbrcnncr supposcdly is offcring tltc
youngster $l million it year for the first two
ycnrs, all of which probably would be spent
in the minors.

I’cw figure the boss. with all his brashncss
and ccccntricitics, could be that stupid.

Titc vcry thought of such an act already
has slirrcd bittcr emotions iii a locker room
know wouldwidc as “'I‘hc Bronx Zoo”
bccztusc of its almost cunsltttti tttrtuoil.

“l ncvcr thought l'd scc tltc day when a
minor lcttgucr would make Inorc than I
would ttftcr i5 yctus in lhc mttjor lcttgucs,"
cotnplttincd Lou Piniclla. one of thc
Yankccs' longtime rcliablcs, “i don't know
how good it baseball player ltc is. 'l'hc only
way to find out is by riding tltc buscs III the
tnittor lcttgucs for a while."

()scztr (iambic. lllt: tcatn‘s most consistent
home run hitter, added: "Why don‘t thcy
spend sonic money on a bailplaycr? He's a
football pittycr. Put it ballplaycr.”
