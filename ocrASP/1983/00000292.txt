Trying to "harness the wind" is
not thottght to be the most practical
endeavor. Bruce Bailey agrees in
some 'circumstanccs, bill to the
SUNY researcher, harnessing the
power in wind is serious scicncc.

Bailey, who has been with
SUNYA‘s Atmospheric Sciences
Research Center since late 1974,
first began rcscarch on solar cncrgy.
only to later lind himself concen-
trating on a different rcsuurcc -—
tltc wind systems which coincided
with his solar rcscurch.

Over tltc coursc of seven years,
Bailey has become a pioneer in a
field itt which thcrc has been little
exploration.

But there is interest.

Bailey’s expertise is utilized by
both individuals and tttilitics that
want to locate tltc bcst place to set
up windmills. According to Builcy.
the best wind sites include
shorclincs. hills and tnountnintops,
making Long island, the Catskills
and tltc Adirondacks the bust sites
in New York Sitttc.

littilcy hcgins his hunt by looking

at topographical maps to pinpoint
tltc sites of highest elevation. He
then surveys the land frottt a
ltclicoptcr. looking for unforcstcd
ltilltops. since trccs obstruct and
thus slow windspccd. Consequently
Bailcy installs instruments to
measure wind velocity and direc-
tion. After examining the data,
Bailey can make a recommendation
of the best sites.

Bttt arc windmills worth the titttc
and money? According to littiicy,
"Wind systems are wcii-worth tltc
cost, since they arc cconomicttl in
the long run and producc clcttn
energy. in areas where utility costs
are high and wind spccd is fast.
such as in Long island, windmills
are a good investment."

The New York State Wind Ett-
ergy Handbook, written by Bailey
1nd publishcd by the State Encrgy
Office, is a comprcltcnsivc cott-
sumcr's guide to choosing. buying
and operating smallcr-sizcd. clcc-
tricity generating windmills. lict'orc

mation must be coilcclcd ott thc

prclcrably for one year. "To pur-
chase a windmill, it will cost
$l5,000 or more. so money is essen-
tial." Bailey said. "Especially since
this doesn‘t include maintenance or
the costs of gatltcring information.
Harnessing "free" wind is expen-
sivc, although tax incentives are of-
fcrcd by the government to offset
tltc high costs and induce people to
invest in the energy saving wind-
mills.“ he explained.

“At tltc prcscrii timc, mainly in-
dividuals who want to reduce their
utility bills buy windmills, although
some consumers btty them for
philosophical reasons." But, Baily
said. “within the next five to ten
years i feel that this will change and
wind farms will become more corn-
mon as an alternate source of
cttcrgy."

liailcy ttlso pointed out that in the
future utility costs will be rising as
wind systcms decrease in price. l'lc

and Hawaii. which have set tip wind

Professor leads attempts to harness the "wind

ambitious plans. Bailey said. 10 to
20 percent of these states' energy
could be produced by windmills by
the year 2000. And, wind systems,
Bailey added, produce energy at
half the cost of nuclear plants.

in addition. wind power is a clean
form of energy which has minimal
ci‘fccts on lhc environment. with no
residual air pollution, acid rain, and
carbon dioxide buildup. Bailey, in
fact. said he feels that the building

of nuclear power plants should stop .
until they have resolved the pro-
blem of how to store nuclear waste.

“Wind systems are not the only
energy source," he concluded. “it‘s
one of tnany. Realistically. by the
year 2000, 5 percent of this
country's energy could be produced
by wind systems." ltc said, lcsscn-
ing this country‘s ovcrdcpcttdcncc
