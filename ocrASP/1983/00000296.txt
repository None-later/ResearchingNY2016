cond audit of the foundation said
Wclch. “but the last one in I975
was nothing like this."

"Funds carmarkcd for certain
programs. originally. arc no longcr
rclcvanr criteria to thc
foundation." said a spokcsmtin for
the State Comptrollcr's officc.
Marvin Nailor. Hc nolcd that funds

Tltc purpose of the foundation is
to support the university. cmphasiz-
cd Wclch. He noted that privdlt
donors. whclhcr individuals or cor-
porations. will dcsignrttc whcrc they
want the money to go. “Somc
designate funds for a narrow pur-
pose. others have a broad designat-
tion. It depends on the terms." he
explained.

Wclch addcd that tile comp-
trollcr's office was criticizing thc cx-
pcnditurc of about $4.000 over two
years. when the foundation dtiltilicti

mcntcd.

President of the foundation’s
Board of Directors chwin Emcr-
son said, “you have to keep in mind
that these are private monies. There
was nothing inappropriate with the
foundations cxpcnditurcs."

Wclch agrccd. saying thru thcrc
are different sets of criteria for
public agencies and privatc non-
profit agcncics. “The advantage of
the foundation is that we got to ptit
moticy whom the statc cannot." hc
said. Wclch cxplaiticd that the state
control pity the cxpcnscs l'or dcatt
candidatcs on second visits.
\vhcrcns thc foundation can on thc
basis that "wc ill‘C trying to help tlic

lion."

I-lc cirtplrrtsizcd that thc foundri-
tion's purpose is to s'ttppor' the
university. “The auditors look at
the foundation its an illictl I‘orcc."
he added.

In a Icttcr accompanying the
'cport. Frank Francis. dircctor of'
licld audit in tiic coinptrollcr's of-
I'icc. said. "Wc question lltL' ill)-

propriatcncss of expenditures for
Christmas parties. picnics and per-
sonal expenses? He recommended
that the foundation make sure that
the fund accounts meet the intent of'
the fund donor. are not personal cx-
pcnscs. and are charged to thc ap-
propriate account.

Nailor remarked that a contract
tnust bc sci up to “spell out" the
conditions. and criteria of the
grants to make sure they are not
"used for something else. The
education of students Is not being
scrvcd in parties and picnics." lic
added.

Wclch noted that tltc rcport was
criticizing a "very small part" of
the foundations activity. Hc
cstimtitcd that thc foundation
handles about I.200 cxpcndlturcs a
your. Ilc added that some of thc
otlicr programs the foundation sup-
ports are assistantship. srudcitt ttid.
loan funds. and about 50 academic
programs.

Wclch said that tile orgunivation

Is not it problem for most students.
Bonnie Campbell. a senior. received
nint- credits for a 23-hour per week

Her main job was Writing news

"they went out for coffcc for mc."
Campbell sald."thc most important
thing she Icarticd was how to work
under pressure." She added. "I
don't think thcy could do without
intcrns."

In contrast. Rich liadcr. a
sophomore prcscntly interning at
WNYT said. "I lose it lot of‘

said. "in the fall I wouldn't be sur-
