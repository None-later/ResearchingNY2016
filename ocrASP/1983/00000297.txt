There’s a better way
to see America this summer:

Now that school’s out, take some time out to see America.
And a great way to see it is on Greyhound with Ameri ass“.

The Greyhound Ameri ass is your passport to un imited
travel in the US. and Cana a. For one economical price, you gel
the freedom of over 100,000 miles of Greyhound routes coast to
coast. And you can get an Ameripass for '7, 15, or 30 days.

If you're going straight home, don’t forget about I .
Greyhound’s convenient schedules. No matter where you re got.
chances are Greyhound's go'ing there.

So this summer, leave your car at home and go Greyhound
with an Ameripass.

For more information, call your local Greyhound agent.
