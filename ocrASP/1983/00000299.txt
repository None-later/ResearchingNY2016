SPORTS EDITOR

The Albany State Great Dane
baseball team played more games in
a 48 hour span late last week than
they had the entire month of April.

The Danes split doubleheaders
with SUNYAC rivals Oneonta and
Cortland to earn their ﬁrst two wins
ol‘ the season and move their record
to 2-5. Each of the four games
played should be counted as a
moral victory for Albany. which
has yet to play on its home field and
has missed l8 of 25 scheduled
games.

“We were just plain happy to
play some baseball." Albarty head
coach Dave Haight said.

Albany pounded the Red
Dragons of Oneonta in the first
game of their twinbill on Saturday.
14-6. Senior Ralph Volk went the
distance in picking rrp his first win
of the year. Volk gave up fortr hits
and only two earned runs while
throwing only 80 pitches during the
entire game. After giving up single
runs in each of the first three intr-
ings, the righty shut down the Red
Dragons until the seventh and firm]
inning.

“I started off pitching slow brrt
then i got into a groove," Volk said
about his live Strikeout. four walk
performance.

The Danes were led offensively
by Jerry Rosen. The senior catcher
had seven RBIs with two mighty sw-
ings of his but. Rosen doubled with
the bases loaded iii the sixth, driv-
ing in three. The next inning saw
Rosen come to the plate with run-
ners on every base and he blasted a
grand slant homerun to account for
the remainder of his rtrrr produc-
tion.

Third baseman Bob Conklin cott-
linued his torrid hitting pace. going
six for nine for the doubleheader,
collecting three hits in each game.
“i just want to get otrt there and
play. I’m very confident at the
plate," he said.

Albany scored ll of their l4 runs
in the last three innings pounding
pitchers Mike Poll and .Ioc
Dohancy. Leadoff hitter llugh
Davis scored four runs and had two
singles. Freshman shortstop Davc
Thelcnran went four for four, had
an RBI and crossed the plate twice.

“We got our bats going in the
fifth. sixth and seventh innings,“
pitching coach Kevin Karwath com<
merited. “Everyone was hitting. We
were stroking the ball real well.”

Mikc Milano replaced ccntcr-

ﬁelder Greg Mulhall in the sixth
and responded with three R315 and
two runs scored on a double and a
hit-by-piteh.

The Albany bats continued their
pumrncling of Oneonta pitchers in
the start of the nighlcap. The Danes
scored four runs in the ﬁrst and ad-
ded two more in the second to jump

out to a quick 6-0 lead. Doug Palley‘

managed to survive the Albany
rampage and held them in check the
rest of the way. The Red Dragons.
after being set down in order for the
first three innings, scored eight
times to pull otrt an 8-6 win.

within one of the Danes at 6-5.

"Dolen has a big time crrrve and
.hc second time they (Oneonta)
came to the plate they weren't as
anxious. They were waiting on
him." Karwath explained.

A key play in the inning was an
error by left ﬁelder Joe Aulogia.
With bases loaded, Aulogia
misplaycd a ball that splashed on
the Wet outfield turf allowing all
three runners to score and giving
the Red Dragons their first tallies of
the game.

“I should take part of thc blame
for that play.” Haight said.
“Because the ground was so wet we
wanted the outfielders to play in
because very few balls would get by
them. I just didn’t check on where
Joe (Aulogia) was playing. He was
too deep."

play at third. However lie was call-

for leaving the base too early. The
Albany bcnclt thought it was a poor
call by the umpire. “It's bad to cry
sortr grapes, btrt the ttcxt guy up in
tire rrcxl inning got a single. That
wottld have been the go ahead run.
Lct's just say it was a billl call.“
Karwath said.

Thclcrnan smacked a two rrrrr
homer and scored another rrrn to
lead the Dane attack. The freshman
has been sensational for the Danes
botlr offensively and defensively.
“l-lc is the best player they (Albany
State) are ever going to ltavc here."
Karwath said. “He is one of the two
best ball playch irt our lcaguc and
thc best at his position." Haight ttd-
