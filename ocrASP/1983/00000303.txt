Advising centers to consolidate

By Mike Taubleb

The Humanities Advisement
Center will cease to exist as a
separate adviserncrtt faculty and be.
combined with the Center for
Undergraduate Education. accor-
ding to Vice President for
Academic Affairs. Judith Ramalcy.

She confirmed that “it has been
decided to consolidate MAC and
CUE for budgetary reasorts. since
they both offer similar. - .
state budget crisis has necessitated
this merger. as well as ctrts in rrtarry
support positions throughout the
university. Meetings are still going
on between the leaders of “AC
Director loan Savitt. and (‘tlli
Director Stanley Sclrwarti. to deter-
rniue the features of MAC worth in
eorporating into CUE."

Schwartz commented "that the
role of faculty members is ortc mar
jor aspect of MAC under considera-
tiort. in regard to staff cuts. we
don‘t expect arty for next year."

According to Rarnnlcy "a steady
transition is desired irt all areas of
consolidation. though the precise
status of Savitt iu the new (,‘tlli, as
well as students currently being ad-
vised at “AC, is unclear right now.
incoming freshmen will be assigned
to (‘Uli rrporr attending summer
orientation."

liarnttlcy explained that by the
end of the spring. a more corrrplctc
plrtrr for this consolidation will he
submitted to her from leaders of
MAC and (‘Uli The former home
of llA('. llurnrrnitics ll7. would be
rescued for instructional use.

At the present time, Savitt is the
only person paid at l‘IAC. She
noted that "the rest of the advising
is done on a voluntary basis by
faculty members attd teaching
stunts. A staff of professors is
necessary" irt arty adviserrrcrtt center
to train teaching assistrtrrts arid
because they. themselves have
significant csperience in aiding
students rrtap their college careers."

Right now 270 students with
llllllL'LliliL'tl majors are advised at
llAt‘. estimated Savitt. those have
declared tnaiors will be advised in
the future by their particular
dcpartrncnts. She asserted that
there will always be faculty
members that students cart seek out
l'or' advice.

Schwart/ said that "1.500
students are now advised at t‘llli

school and it‘s an honor for rrs
when i think about the fine ill\lllll-
lions that ltoslcd it previously. i
hope it will also stir some tennis in-
terest on campus."

With the tour'rnuncnt being held
duringI l'inals \\cck there is a rprcs-
tiort on Iron rrntclr I‘an appeal it will
have.

"I think the students would want
a break trout studying arid will
come out in the sun for a few hours.
relay. and watch some good
tennis." said Lewis.

(‘nnninglram agreed: "I think
students have more time during
l'inals because they don't have arty
classes. the rrratches will be during
the (lay so it won't interl'cr'c with
night studying. l’lus admission is
free."

During the tottr namcnt. there will
be a tournament Awards Dinner at
the l’atroorr Room. Awards such as
coach ot' the year. Anthcr Aslrc
Player ol' the Ycar (sportsmanship
arid clraractcr), and others will be
handed out.

"'l'Itcrc's been a lot of organizing
that lrrrs gone on a lot of hours of
work spent. concluded Lewis. “i
will be very gratified it" otrr ct'l’orts
ltclp make this l983 National ‘l'en-
nls Tournruncnt run smoothly." l l

and approximately 300 would be
added from HAC this fall. Only
four years ago. all incoming
freshmen were advised at CUE.
before HAC was created so that the
extra advisement load should be
met more titan adequately.

He added that CUE will still be
known as CUE after the merger.

“Tire role of HAC has been

signiﬁcantly expanded over the
years," said Savitt. When it was
first established four years ago. no
students were formally advised; it
ran purely on a walk-in basis.
"Over the years." said Savitt.
"entering students were assigned to
HAC until the beginning of this
year. when there were 400 students
assigned here. D
