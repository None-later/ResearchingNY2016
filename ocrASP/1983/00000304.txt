problem every year when students
leave. especittlly right in the heart of
the strident ghetto." She added,
“we want to keep the neighborhood
clean and we‘re looking for
cooperation from the students who
live there."

l’odolsky went on to describe a
project launched by the Pine llills
Neighborhood Association, a

Albany Downtown areas from
Woodlawrt to Washington Avenues
arid take to Pine Avctttres.

will pick tip all garbage from areas

added. “Quail Street betwecrt
