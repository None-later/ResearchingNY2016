Editor’s
Aspect

C, I remember when we did our first issue. last

June. We didn't have enough copy for our
'1 centerfold. and as Megan and l tried to lay it
, out. We kept finding ourselves in front of the
9 typesetter. typing in more copy in order to have

(“cannot/v»

M

 the centerfold look "balanced". We titled our

first centerfold "Great Expectations". for the in
coming freshman class. But looking back on it
now I believe our title was as much for the high
hopes we had for ourselves in the months that
were ahead. lfelt a lot of pressure taking on the
job as editor. there were so many editors before
me that had put out a section that was held with
such high regard. The genius of the past editors
was ominous: from the Gissen and Matranga
legacy to the creative sensitivity of lidelstein to
the comic ingenuity of Andy Carroll< this all
spelled out an alphabet of clearly defined stan-
dards that l felt obsessed to equal. I came to this
job with that first and foremost In my mind. and
worke'll with everything I had in order to fulfill
whm lhad promised myselfl must accon‘rplish.
My {dimer editor. Mr. Dean Betz told me on a
cor le of occasions that l did. Whether he was
simply biased because I was "his Aspects editor"
i‘llnever kiiow, But the day he told me that will
br in my memory forever. True or not.

Back when l was a freshman I cut out an
Jeditorial written by Jay Gissen wherein he
' spoke of time. and making the most of ones life.

We would like to take this opportunity to make a statement of our editorial
policy: We generally print only one submission of any author or artist chosen
for publication in Tangent. The exceptions are works of particularly short
length or someone who is here for a short time only and this will be our only
chance to present work of that quality. Because of our limited space we feel
this policy is fair and most representative to the SUNYA community.

Tangent will be available
in the Campus Center Main
Lobby and the Humanities
Lounge (HUM 354)

I still have it today and it‘s been hanging up in
Wery place that I've lived in since. It signifies
more than a mere philosophical essay for me.
At that time in my life I looked at the ASP and
Aspects as something I could appreciate from
afar; for whatever reason. I was too intimidated
to approach this place then. In a sense that
editorial symbolized something i believed
myself, but was not ready to challenge. Well.
it's been four years since then. and although i
am where I always thought I wanted to be. alas.
all fairy tales don't come true. Typically
enough. this has been one of the hardest jobs
I’ve ever experienced in my life. It’s a trite and
cliched realization. but I guess thats what
idealization does for you. I’m not saying this
wasn't a good experience; as 1 write this the
fondest and happiest memories are flooding
back to me. but We learned many difficult
lessons here. spent what it seems like decades,
of all—nighters drinking caffeine. and felt the
frustration of realizing all that you meant to ex
press was often completely misconstruedYet
the magical moments were there also. And
many of them. But now it’s over. I‘ve finished
my job and it’s time to move on. And as my
former Aspects editor. Andy Carroll did last
year at this time. I'd like to thank a few people.
perhaps not quite as cryptically as he did. First
and foremost l’d like to thank Megan Taylor for
her patience and perhaps most of all, her
understanding. (Great Expectations???) l’d like
to thank Wayne Peereboom and Dean Betz for
constantly getting me 12 pages and always
sticking up for me in times of question. l’d like
to thank all my writers for helping me put out
the section I did every week, and Will Yurman
for his photographic expertise. And though it
may sound strange, l'd like to thank Rob Edels-
tein and Stu Matranga for inspiring me to try to
create a new standard (though it may not have
been all that successful). and a very special,
particular thanks to Mr. Carroll for not only in-
spiring me. but for teaching me and for grvrrrg
me this priviledge in the first place. I really Will
miss this place. There's nothing else like it. El
