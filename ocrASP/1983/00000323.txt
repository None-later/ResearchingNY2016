A revision ol' last year's hard-
wott bottle bill overwhelmingly
passed the Legislature May 27th,
tittd will postpotte I'nll implementa-

new law its air utmeeessaty delay
and far too speeii'ie. They also ltold
that the beverage industry
overstated its irtabilily to rtreet the
original implementation date of ,In-

Proponents of the amendments
hold that the beverage industry. itt
its elarrror to oppose the original
law. l'ailed to closely examine the
technical requirements for im-
plementation, and were ttoi
prepared. instead, the beverage
mannl'aetttrets sought to show llte
irnptaetihility ol‘ the hill. "the lit-
dtrstry poittted to Massachusetts,

Several Isey legislators agreed
with this assessment, and believing
that the New York law is vital to the
national hottle law el'l'ort atrd

amendments with the rationale that
