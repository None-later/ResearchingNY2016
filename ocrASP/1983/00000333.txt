in a decision August t5 by
Albany Mayor Thomas Whalen III.
in‘ conjunction with the Albany
Common Council. the overcrowded
3rd volirig district on the uptown
campus was divided creating a new
district 6 and establishing another
off-campus polling place.

The decision by the city officials
to split the 3rd district coincides
with efforts by Student Association
President Rich Schaft'cr and other
student leaders who have been in
contact with city officials through
the summer in an attempt to get
another polling place on campus for
the students of the 3rd district (half
of Dutch Quad and all of' Colonial
Quad). according to Schaf'fer.

Schafl‘cr and SA Attorney Mark
Mischlcr, however. are displeased
with this redistricting by the city.
according to Mischlcr. and are for-
mulating a lawsuit that would ques-
tion the grounds on which the
district change was made. he said.

Misclilcr declined to be specific at
this time regarding the contents of
the lawsuit.

“The old district (3) should have
been left alone. What we essentially

want is a third district on campus."
said Mischlcr. The half of Dutch
Quad and all of Colonial that fall
into the old district 3 have sufficient
populations to be its own voting
district with an oil-campus polling
place, ltc explained.

Asked about the pending legal ac-
tion by Mlschler and schaffer,
Whalen stated that he trad not been
personally contacted in regard to
the suit biit that the Albany Cor-
poration Counsel offices had
received news of the suit.

After the change the 3rd district,
on campus. was reduced to include
only half of Dutch Qttrid. that
would still vote at the St. Mrrrgarct
Mary's School. at “68 Western
Avenue. lint. all of Colonial Qtiad
becorrtes part of the new (ah district
with a polling place at the Executive
House, a part of the Thruway llyatt
House. on Washington Avenue
across from the campus.

The decision for this polling
place. however. was the result of
talks between Scliaffcr and Whaleri
concerning student access and safe-
ly going to the polls. The city's first
choice for the polling place. on
August l5, was the Star 'l‘extile l'ac-
tory on l-‘ullcr Road across l-‘)t)
from the campus.

New Bottle Bill law forces
UAS to have refund areas

By Debbie Judge

(UN I’RIIIU I'INU l:'[)l1(lR

 

UAS has gone “beyond what’s
required by law to make it conve-
nient” for students to redeem
beverage containers by establishing
nine oil-campus redemption
centers. UAS Director Norbct
Zahm said. But he also indicated
that if students do not trike advan-
tage of the centers sct tip to comply
with the recently passed statewide
returnable beverage law. the
number would be reduced to one.

Although referred to as the Bottle
Bill. the law. which went into effect
September l2, requires a deposit of
at least 5 cents on all glass. metal.
and plastic containers up to orie-

lnlcrcst Research Group to err-
courage redemption.

But. “We won't collect them if
people don‘t redeem them - it's
their loss." he said.

NYPIRG will begin distributing
flyers on university redempiion
cctitcrs and basic bottle bill facts.
according to NYPlRG‘s campus
chairman Bernie Bryant.

The organization will be trrbling,
handing out the pamphlets and sup-
plying copics to RA's and campus
offices. "We want to get people to
know the services are available.” he
said.

"If the services are not trscd. then
UAS will cut (redemption centers)
down to just the commissary. At

that point. students might just as

 

 

 

 

 

 

gallon size. Containers nitrst have a
New York rcfund label to be
redeemed; distributors were given
until last Monday to clear their
shelves of unlabeled containers.

As a result of the law. the price of
canned soda on campus has gone up
to 40 cents.

Cans. bottles and other con-
tainers marked for deposit will be
redccmablc at the commissary. sub
shops at each of the five quads, the
bowling alley. campus barbershop
and Kumquat Cafeteria on the
Draper Campus.

"We are standing by, waiting to
see if and where students redeem
cans," Zahm said. He also said
UAS was working with student
groups such as the New York Public

well go to a local store."

Bryant said NYPlRG would not
get involved in' collecting for
profit's sake. because the group
receives funding from students. in—
stead. they will leave that to
Telethon and other groups trying to
raise revenue. .

“There'll be some confusion.
because we are not obligated to take
back containers which UAS does
not sell.” Zahm explained.

The law mandates that a cori-
sumcr can return empties to any
vendor that sells the same type -
that is. brand. size. shape. color
and composition - container. A
store may reject a container if it is
not among the type it sells. if it does

Schaffcr held a news conferencv
at the factory on that day and ex-
pressed his disagreement with the
city ovcr the choice of a polling
place at the factory. He also voiced
his opposition to the redistricting of
the 3rd district. .

more than 1,000 voters in the
district." said Whalen.

According to Mischlcr the district
change by city officials only makes
voting more complicated for the
students.

Regarding his relations with new

commented. “His comments to the
news media present a somewhat
confrontational attitude."

Council voted at their " , '
meeting to change the polling place
to Washington Avenue.

Whalen commented that the reason
the city officials acquiesced to the
demands of the strident leaders was
that. “Students raised the issue of
safety so we moved the polling
place to where tltcrc is only one big
red light."

The polling place is not the major
issue in this controversy. according
to Scliaffer. “i am not complaining
that people have to walk across the
street. it‘s that Wlialcn has ger-
rymandcrcd the district. " he said.

gerrymandering aimed at him by
