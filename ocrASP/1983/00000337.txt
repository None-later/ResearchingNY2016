to this campus which looks like Aristotle's-
version of a military camp. this place of tun-

at SUNY-Blnghamton. the college I'll always
call home. Registration there Is a matter of|
filling out quartered grid sheets with course
numbers and prol's signatures. Each depart-
ment malntairrs class lists supplemented by
computer tally, There's preregistratton and

provided pencils of the sort usually found at

ASPECTS l3-

ramiliar relationship comedy In scenes bet-
ween himself and Mia Farrow. Much of the
oortrayal of the 20’s ls keen. often slapstick
social satire. He parodies psychiatry. the
media. Intellectuals. and the myriad lunacles
)f American life. with the help of hokey
voice-over narration. It can be a hilarious
film. But as one moves away from the core
of diehard Allen fans. It becomes more dif‘
'icult to appreciate the rich and diverse gifts
.he film has to offer. This has been the case
with several other Allen films. most of his
writing. and pieces of his stand up comedy.
:rut it might be even more so with Zellg.
Regardless of one's standing In the hierchy of
Noody Allen fans. this Is a film that Is enter-
taining. thought provoking. ingenius. and
unquestionably worth seeing. For those who
like it. It Is worth seeing again. Only during a
second viewing. when one has become a II!-

Zelig Is not a perfect film, however. In fact.
It may be somewhat dubious even to call it a
great film. No mention ltas yet been made
about plot and character development.
That's because there Isn't really much plot
and character development to speak of.
Critics have harped on this. and with good
reason. The film lacks the kind of depth
which Is needed to cultivate a substantial au-
