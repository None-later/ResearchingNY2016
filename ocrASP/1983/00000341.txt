Fifteen students will be elected to OCA

A SSUCM TE NEWS EDI TOR

Fifteen off-campus students will
be elected this fall to a newly form-
ed Off-Campus Association (SA)
Board of Directors. pending Cen-
tral Council approval Wednesday
night. Student Association officials
announced yesterday. '

The new Board of Directors.
originally formulated by Actitig
Off-Campus Coordinator Suzy
Auletta itiid former SA Vice Presi-
dent Anne Marie LaPorta, will
serve as the governing body for
OCA. They will also handle ()(‘A's

$6.613 budget and rewrite its con-

stitution. which SA President Rich
Schaffer said has ttot been fully up-
dated since tlte mid-l970's.

The l5 members will elect of-
ficers internally. and. as Schaffer
decribcd it. will act as a "qund
board“ for off-campus stttdents.
Attletta noted. however. that
although the structure of this board
will be similar to a quad board the
activities would differ to meet the
interests of off-campus students.

Schaffer said he hopes to submit
this proposal to Cetitral Council
next Wednesday night so the board
could he elected during the fall elec-
tions.

The Off-Campus coordinator
would deal primarily with issues.
whereas the job of governing OCA
will be handled by the board of
directors. who would also be
responsible for organizing pro-
grams. The duties of the off-
campus coordinator would not
overlap with the role of the direc-
tors. according to Attletta.

Off-Campus stttdents. Schaffer
tinted. "are not getting their fair
share of SA tax money. This is a
way for us to provide more services
for tltctn atid allow them to govcrti
their own organization."

In other business at Wednesday's
meeting. Central Council approved

Conservatives join PIRG

Mi Itltotipulis. M N
(Cl’S) iii a tiiovc that may auger a
new kind of assttalt on campus
Public Interest Groups (l’lRCrs) tia-
tioiiwidc. a grottp of conservative
students ltave tried to infiltrate and
change the policies of the statewide
Minnesota PIRG board.

Though the conservatives failed
lll their summer attempt. they have
already sttccecdcd iti gaining cott-
trol over the stnallcr Twin Cities
l’lRG chapter.

Their activities closely icscmhlc
tactics for disrupting l’lRCrs outlin~
ed in a reported College Republican
Natiotial Committee memo
distribtttcd last spring.

llotli the national College
Republicans and the local conser-
vative insurgents deny any attempt
to destroy I’lRGs or any coor-
dinated efforts in Minnesota.

But i’lRGs — the national net—
work of some lot) catiipus-bascd

consumer advocacy grottps founded
by Ralph Nader iii the early seven-
ties — ltavc long bcctt targets of
sortie souservative groups.

The Mid-Atlantic Legal Founda-
tion. a I’liiladclpliia-bascd conscr-
vativc advocacy group, has sited lllt.‘
New Jersey l’lRG over its method
of collecting studctit fees.

Last spring. thc College
Republicans, which is largely fund-
cd by the Republican National
Committee, rcptttcdly issued a
lengthy memo call on its campus
chapters to trtotttit local challenges
to the l’lRLi‘s funding methods. ac-
cording to syndicated columnists
Maxwell (lien and Cody Shearer.

At about the same tittie. l3 coser-
vativc University of Minnesota
students tnunagcd to gain control of
the Twin Cities chapter. (‘huptei
leaders were surprised.

“We didn‘t expect a group of op-
pottctits to misrepresent themselves

and get on one of otu boards," says
John (iastovich. head of Minnesota
l’lRG (MPIRG).

llut Richard Clem. co~cltairman
of tile Twin Cities l’lRG and one of
the lfl conservatives. deities it.

“Two of our members are Col-
lege Republicans." ltc concedes.
"but l‘m certainly not. And l‘iii not
out to destroy l’lRGs. I want to see
us all work together on such things
as environmental issues. litit simply
disagree with tltc way the group is
funded and witli sortie of their posi-
lions.“

in last spririg‘s “l’tojcct inform"
memo to mobili/e campus conscr-
vativcs against l’lR(is, College
Republicans Chairman Jack
Abramoff supposedly called for
“slacking” l’lRCr meetings to
disrupt the groups atid so “it
doesn‘t look like an attack on the
left by the tight."

October l7 and 18 as SA election
days. Nominations will be taken in
the SA of l‘icc September 26-30.
Positions available include one
Council representative frotn each
quad. four representatives from
off-campus and ‘two SASU
delegates. Elections will also be held
for Off-Campus board of directors
il' Council approves the proposal.

Schaffer withdrew his appoint-
tnetit of Suzy Auletta for the posi-
tioti of off-campus coordinator
stating that Auletta felt that other
people should be interviewed for
the positiott since she had originally
been appointed for the stitniucr
because Schaffer didn‘t have titnc
to scrccti applicants.

Schaffer later admitted that up-
pointing Auletta to the position for
the year without scteeuiug other up-
plicants is iii violation of the SA af-
firmative action policy. He said he
will interview applicants on Mon»

day and Tuesday and submit an ap-
poinlment to Council on Wednesv
day.

Central Council Chair Bob
llclbock announced the following
committee chair appointments:
Finance Chair Mitch Fcig, Vice
Chair Laura Cunningham; Inter-
collegiate Athletics Co-chairs Dan
Altman and Barbara Hurwitz;
Academics Chair Roxanne Albond:
Internal Affairs Chair Neil Shapiro.
Vice Chair Maureen Ryan; Student
Action Chair Steve Gawley; and
Student Services Chair .lcl‘f Weins-
tcitt.

During a summer meeting at
(‘amp Dippikill. Council voted
against a proposal by Schaffer that
the off-campus coordinator be con-
sidcted a member of tltc executive
branch, Schaffer said he plans to
resubmit the proposal after the
position of off—campus coordinator
ltasbcett filled. [ 1

Deadline extended

(CPS) liducution Sec. Terrcl ilcll
first gave schools until Sept. l to
make sure all male aid applicants
had registered for tile draft. but has
pushed the deadline now to Oct. l.

The law says men can't get aid if
they haven’t registered. They tiittst
now sigti a fortn swearing they‘ve
done it.

Bell extended the dealiiic because
.cliools said they couldn't track
non—signing students down during
the summer.

A Minnesota federal judge over-
turned the law Jutic l7lh. but 2
weeks later Supreme Court Justice
Harry Blacktnun allowed the law to
take effect at least tttitil the full

court hears arguments iii the case.
probably this fall or winter.

The "stop and start" re-
thtiretncttts have confused campus
financial aid officers. Auburn‘s aid
chief.

Texas aid counselor remains
“very uncomfortable with the law.
wliilc Michigan State expects to
spend $l5.000 to chase aided
students who may have yet to sign
the registration pledge.

llut few ofﬁcers say they've had
to delay awarding aid to students
because of the changing court rul-
ings and government deadlines, said
aid officer association official Den-
nis Martin.
