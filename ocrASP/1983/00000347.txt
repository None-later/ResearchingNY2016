Future is uncertain for aging Wellington Hotel

DCM TE NE W5 EDITOR

 

The future of the Wellington Hotel. an op-
tional dormitory facility for SUNYA
students. is still uncertain after the University
refused to buy the hotel from the city this
past summer.

On June 17 Mayor Thomas Whalen ill
and City Engineer James Waugaman con-
ducted a tour of the building for university
ofﬁcials President Vincent O’Leary and Vice
President for University Affairs Lewis
Welch. and others. with the hopes that the
University would buy the downtown struc-
ture.

According to Whalen the city offered the
whole structure to the University to be
redone as a SUNYA dormitory. "The

University turned it down because it would
cost too niuch to make it conform to dor«
mitory standards." Whalen said.

“There was nothing about dollar price (for
the hotel). we Just looked at it." said Welch.
“We looked at the heating systems. rooms.
roof. furniture and decorations and decided
that it would be millions of dollars over some
years to bring it to dormitory status." he
said. “It's an old building and the systems
and equipment are aging." he added.

As far back as last December Whalen an-
nounced that the City wanted to sell the hotel
and that it ran “44,000 in the red for the
l981-82 year. However, neither Whalen nor
Albany Corporation Counsel Vincent McAr-
die could speciﬁcally quote any additional
losses that the hotel might have incurred for
the i982-83 year. Whalen did say though that
the hotel does continue to lose money.

“It (the hotel) is for sale but We have not
put it on the market." Whalen said.

For the past eight years the Wellington has
housed about ISO students per semester. ac-
cording to SUNYA Director of Residential
Life John Martone. He explained that the
hotel has its own residential director who
takes care of all student requests for housing.

The university is simply a referral source for
the students who wish to. or have to live at
the hotel. he added.

“We don't want to be in the hotel
business." said McArdle. “it is not
something that a municipality should do."
The city simply wants to divest itself of the
hotel. he said, and is looking for someone to
buy it and operate it for the betterment of
downtown Albany.

The city of Albany bought the hotel in
l975 and SUNYA students have lived there
since that time. “Probably an arrangement
between the former mayor (Erastus Corning
ii) and the University." said McArdle. "The
City bought the hotel because it is a promi-
nent building on a prominent street and we
got it at a low price. only $100,000." he said.
The former owners foreclosed on the proper-
ty and the City bought the hotel from a city
bank. McArdle added.

When asked about the security of the
students now living at the hotel. Welch com-
mented that it depends on who buys it. "it's
200 spaces for students but there are 5.000
off-campus students so that In totality it
might not be that bad." he said. “We have
been for years looking for additional campus
housing on or near the campus." sais Welch.

According to McArdle the hotel is in much
better shape than when the City originally
bought it. “Since then the City has put a half
a imillion dollars into it to refurbish it," he
sa d.

Because the hotel is owned by the City. its
deficit is ﬁnanced by city taxpayers and in
discussing the amount of revenue lost an
Albany Times Union article on Dec. 8. 1982.
pointed out that the hotel did business with a
“favored few ...with sometimes no attention
to state requirements about competitive bid-

ding." According to the article the hotel took
in S36|.922 in 1981-82. $175,913 of which
was collected from SUNYA students for their
rooms in the Howard Street portion of the
building. The rooms were rented for $550 pe
semester. Fl

After putting in your nightly four
hours of studying and socializing at
.the library do you question your
safe return back to the quad?
Whether you do or not you should
know the university and concerned
groups are striving again this year to
make SUNYA safe.

Women's Safety Awareness
Days, a three day program beginn-
ing September 28. sponsored by the
President's Task Forcc on
Women’s Safety, will provide a
forum to examine the question of
women’s safety on campus.
According to Crimes Against
Women Update released by John
weekly to discuss revisions or prob-
lems concerning women's safety.
have been at least two incidents of
Sexual harassment reported by
women near the library since July.

The Awareness Days. which are
sponsored by Student Association.
Feminist Alliance. Student Affairs

  

and the Afﬁrmative Action Office,
will sponsor speakers from New
York Women Against Rape and
other women's groups.

The coordinator of Women's
Safety Awareness Days. Libby
Post. stressed that SUNYA was tak-
ing a large and responsible step to a
safer campus for women.
“Women's Safety Awareness Days
is indicative of the leadership role
SUNYA has taken in the realm of
women's safety. We are looked to
by other higher education institu-
tions as an example of what can be
done on campus to protect our
students."

Featured speakers will be discuss-
ing topics which include Date Rape.
Sexual Harassment. Law and
Women’s Safety. and Racism and
Women's Safety.

The President's Task Force on
Women's Safety. which meets bi-
weekly to discuss revisions or pro-
blems concerning women‘s safety
on campus. is in the process of in-
vestigating several campus safety

issues. According to the Director of

' Afﬁrmative Action Gloria DeSole,

the Task Force is discussing the
possibility of changing the SUNYA
bus system to make it safer for
downtown female students. “We're
working on the advantages and
disadvantages of having the buses
stop at every corner." she said.

The student escort service has
also been under careful scrutiny ac-
cording to college Controller James
Van Voorst. “We have been look-
ing into improving the student
patrol system. We've been ques-
tioning whether or not it is right to
assign students to such a task as
this." he said.

Other improvements on campus
will be the addition of two
policemen who will be patrolling
the podium at night. They will be
driving mopeds which are presently
being ordered." Van Voorst said.

Other precautionary measures
that have been taken. noted Van
Voorst. include the rclnstallatlnn of

Central Council established the
position of SA off-campus coor-
dinator Wednesday night. then ap-
pointed Suzy Aulctta to the posi-
tion. and reviewed an audit of Stu-
dent Association for the l982-83
fiscal year. Previously. the position
was a professional one funded by
SA.

Auletta. a Dutch Quad RA and
former Central Council member
will receive a stipend of $l375. The
council vote was 22-2-0.

Several off-campus residents
however, spoke in opposition to the
appointment. They argued that a
student living on-campus might not
be as effective as an off-campus stu-
dcnt. They also criticized Schaffer
for the selection procedure. saying
that not everyone had been given
adequate time to apply for the posi-
tion. “What's not sitting easy with
me." said off-campus coordinator
applicant Melinda Miller. “is the
excuse that she’s (Auletta) been ap-

Auletta said she experienced off-

for the position is organizational

Auletta was temporarily ap-
pointed over the summer by SA
President Rich Schaffer. He had
planned to submit her appointment
for the year to Central Council last
week. but he was advised that if he
".lid not interview other applicants
1c would be violating SA's afﬁr-
.native action policy. He advertised
for the position opening on Friday.
and conducted interviews on Tues-
day. Six students were interviewed,
Schaffer said.

Auletta said she plans to work on

grams. several of which have

City Alderman Gerald Jennings.
whose election ward includes Alum-
ni Quad. addressed Council on
Auletta's behalf. “Suzy's going to
be effective, she's already been on
my back a bit." he asserted.

Off-campus representative Dave
Silk and Colonial Quad represen-
tative Nancy Killian cast the votes
against appointing Auletta for the
position. Killian later said she voted
no because she felt a “substantial
number of constituents were ob-
viously opposed to the appointment
of an on-campus person for an off-
:ampus position."

Silk agreed with Killian. adding
that “the total lack of respect
shown for the concept of fair inter»
views and equal chances for all up-
plicants made it impossible for me
to support the President's appoint-
ment." He later noted. however.
