SA tightens its rules in wake cf cinema scandal

 

By Amy Welner

- A closer watch will be kept on student
group funds as a result of last year's $3.500
embezzlement by the University Clnema’s
Executive Board, SA ofﬁcials said.

According to SA President Rich Schaffer.
changes are being made in the handling of
funds within campus organizations. ‘

SA Controller Adam Barsky said he has
designed a Central Sales office to regulate
ticket sales and revenues for SA funded
events.

Sehaffer explained that this will reduce
“the number of people handling the money
for the larger organizations such as Universi-
ty Cinemas and UCB."

The ofﬁce, which will be located next to

. the Contact Ofﬁce. will provide SA funded
groups with prenumbered tickets prior to
each event. Barsky explained. Students runn-
ing the ofﬁce will record the number of the
ﬁrst and last ticket each group sells.
Revenues will be collected immediately
following an event and the number of tickets
issued will be reconciled with the amount of
revenue received, Barsky said.

Barsky said SA is also working with the
Accounting Club to develop speciﬁc pro-
jects, including a new inventory system for
the Record Co-Op. identifying and tagging

 

ﬁxed assets. and preparing interim ﬁnancial
statements on the Record Co-op and other
large SA groups.

Another precaution being taken against
embezzlement is bonding ofﬁcers of large SA
organizations. Barsky said. This, 'Schaffer
explained, would provide insurance for any
missing money. "The insurance company
covers the money and does a serious in-
vestigation, much more serious than could be
done within the campus." Sehaffcr explain-
ed. -

in addition, Barsky said, he plans to con-
duct more "spot checks" on groups spending
and revenues. “Groups found in violation of
SA policy will be subjected to disciplinary ac-
tion." such as freezing their budget, Barsky
asserted.

The six University Cinema Board members
charged with etnbezzling SA funds. served I5
days each in Albany County Jail. are on pro-
bation for three years, and were ﬁned SIOOO
each. in addition, they were each required to
return $584 to SA.

One member. .lay Lustgarten. has returned
his sltare of the 'money to SA. The other
students involved are former cinema director
William Braddock. and Executive Board
members Michael Abneri. Michael Kromc .

Rise Shaw and Agostine Ribiero. All are pay-.

ing back the money in installments worked
out during their hearing.

According to Alice Corbin, Student Af-

' fairs judicial ofﬁcer, regarding the students'

penalties within the university. “campus I
hearings have been conducted. reeommenda- _

tions were made and sanctions were im-
plemented by this ofﬁce." She added that
l‘the sanctions vary from community service
projects to suspension ranging from one
semester to one year."Corbin said. "the right
of appeal has been exercised by some
students and those cases have not yet been
resolved." According to Neil Brown, Dean
of Student Affairs, “there were no expul-
sions, only a series of suspensions." When
asked speciﬁcs of which students were
suspended or which were appealing, Dean
Brown said that “under the Buckley Amend-
ment and Family Protection Act" he was not
at liberty to divulge that information. He said
"the university tries to be very ethical in
terms of students' permanent records, and
since this incident was '.-.'tthln the SA we
prefer to talk about a generic outcome
without respect to individual situations." SA
President Rich Sehaffer said he is concerned
with having “organization leaders take
serious responsibility for the services they
provide." [j

College officials fear new round of budget cuts

(CPS) The halting economic “recovery” isn't
cheering up too many college ofﬁcials, who
now worry that even a faster approach of
prosperity may not prevent a new. even
deeper round of cuts in academic programs
and student services for the next school year.

“it's like running full speed ahead just to
stay in one place." says Ken Kirkland. fiscal
affairs director for the National Conference
of State Legislatures (NCSL).

“Thirty-nine out of 50 states have already
cut their (higher education) budgets for this
year," he reports. “And there's certainly no
relief in sight for higher education."

Over the last year, bad business and
unemployment have cut the amount of
money states have collected for taxes. With
less money to spread around, most of those
39 states have forced public institutions —- in-
cluding their colleges — to cut their own
budgcs and halt spending.

Academic cutbacks
have demoralized
college professors

Morganrown. West Virginia
(CPS) When West Virginia developed the
worst unemployment rate in the US and Gov.
Jay Rockefeller cut the state budget in
response, Dr. Donald Menzell ﬁgured it was
time to make a choice.

West Virginia University told him he‘d
have to forget getting any signiﬁcant salary
increase for the second year in a row.

it was too much for the political science
professor, who not only wanted more money
but was dispirited by the constant cutbacks
and academic compromises forced by the
budget problems.

"i cannot function with that much in-
stability," he complains. “if you are at all
professionally-minded, you cannot do that."

So Menzell went job hunting. ﬁnally ﬁn-
ding an open spot at the University of South
Florida, where he'll start this December.

Menzell, ofcourse. is just one of many col-
lege teachers and administrators who are
opening classes this fall trying to escape
severe morale problems while keeping an eye
on the job market.

The severe budget cuts of the last three
years. in short, seem to be pushing teachers
over tltc edge this year.

No one knows exactly how many teachers
are moving. Estimates range from 30.000 to
l00.000. Most likely' to move arc the
'lO0.(XX)-some non-tenured teachers now
working on U.S. campuses. says lrving Spitl~
berg, retiring head of the American Associa-
tion of University Professors (AAUl’), the
third biggest college teacher’s union.

To cut, colleges have fired teachers. leav-
ing students with fewer. more crowded class.
sections from which to choose on many cam-
puses. in some cases, whole academic depart-
ments have been abolished.

All kinds of students services — from
faculty evaluations to free phones in dorms
to campus escort services — have also been
axed at many schools.

And to raise more money, colleges ltavc
been raising tuition and fees. sometimes by us
much as twice the inﬂation rate.

Observers say that. even in light of improv-
cd economic indicators over the last six mon-
ths. American higher education is in for more
of the same in the near future.

“Even with a good year, we'll still pro-
bably have about the same amount of
unemployn " predicts illinois State‘s
M.M. Chambers. who tracks state funding of
higher education across the country.

“We've simply reached a stage where we
have to raise taxes to increase state
revenues," he says. "if state services are go-
ing to be maintained — education included
—— states have to collect more in taxes.“

"State funding cuts are probably hitting
higher education harder now than ever,"
adds Nancy Verde of the Education_Contmis-
sion of the States (ECS), based in Denver.

"We've had budget cuts exceeding $75
million over the last five years." reports
Charles Davis. spokesman for the l9-campus
California State University system.

And for 1983-84. "our system is in for in-
creased cuts and a marked increase in student
fees" in order to cope with the state's pro-
jected $3 billion deficit, Davis says. ‘

The woes are national. Verde of the ECS
says the Pacific and Great Lakes states are
suffering the most. Missouri, Ohio and
Oregon colleges can also look forward to

budget freezes or cuts for Mil-lid.

West Virginia and Alabama are slashing
higher education funding by It) pctccnt.
Arkansas, Kentucky and Louisiana are im
posing five percent cutbacks on thcil Colleges
and universities.

Michigan colleges were saved Irom much
larger cuts for next ycnr when voters LN
month approved a four-year. $3.0 billion t:t\
increase.

Now they'll lose "only" $23 million Iltilll
this year's funding levels.

"That's almost a relief Io us, though,"
says liili Lebenhcrr. of Wayne Slitlc UiHIL’I‘iI-
ty in Detroit.

Educators and students in California.
Ohio. Pennsylvania and Illinois. among
other states, have also been campaigning nc»
tivcly for tax increases to help them avoid
more cuts next year.
