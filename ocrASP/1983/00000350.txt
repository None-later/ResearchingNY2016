Oneonta man found guilty

Cooperstown, New York
(AP) Dr. Howard Veizy. a Methodist
minister and father of slain Oneonta State
College student Linda Veizy. says he's pleas-
ed that Ricky Knapp has been found guilty
and is “off the streets."

After 12 hours of jury deliberations,
Knapp was found guilty of manslaughter
Wednesday in his Otsego County retrial for
the December 1977 death of the 18 year old
student from Long island. Sentencing was set
for Oct. 3. Knapp said he would appeal the
conviction. "We‘re pleased with the guilty
decision," said VeizyI who now lives in the
town of Halncs Fails.

“We never had any doubts about Knapp's
guilt. especially since we have known more
than the jury was allowed to hear," Velzy ad-
ded. "We’re glad he is off the streets because
there is no question in our minds that he is a
danger to society."

The jury found Knapp guilty of second
degree manslaughter but innocent on the
charge of second degree murder.- The
manslaughter charge carries a possible
sentence ofup to 15 years in prison. Or. ifthe
judge determines Knapp is a persistent felony
offenderI Knapp could receive a life
sentence.

in 1978, Knapp was convicted of second-
dcgrce murder in the beating death of Miss
Veizy. The jury that year found Knapp did
not intentionally kill Miss Veizy but willingly
allowed her to die by failing to seek the
medical attention she needed after the
beating to save her life.

The State Court of Appeals overturned the
conviction in October 1982 and threw out
two written confessions by Knapp and
testimony frotn a key prosecution witness. it
ruled that Knapp had been denied access to
an attorney during the police investigation.
This past summer, the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled that it ltad no jurisdiction in the trial.

When asked if he would appeal, Knapp
said. “Yep, you know 1 will." But Knapp‘s

conﬁrm nor deny the question of appeal.

“This experience," said Miss Velzy's
father, "emphasizes the necessity of the crin-
mlnal justice system to take victims and sur-
vivors of victims into consideration." Veizy
has formed a group called VOCAL — Vic-
tims of Crime Advocacy League — which is a‘
network of crime victims and professionals
working with victims. He hopes the group
will be able to influence legislatures and
courts to be more concerned “with justice for
all people,” and not just “due process" for
defendants. 5

Knapp, now 32, has been in custody since‘
his 1978 conviction. serving a 25 year to life
sentence. He did not take the stand in either
of the two trials.

Authorities said Knapp was arrested on
Dec. 31, 1977. as he was dragging Miss
Vclzy's frozen body from his car to a shallow
grave that had been dug in the Town of
‘Oneonta.
