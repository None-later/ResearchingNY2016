FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER 23, [933

 

 

Stephen King

n today's book market. if you are a
fan of novels in the horror vein.
you are most likely a fan of
Stephen King. King's books seem to spring
to the top of the best-seller list Within weeks
of their release and plant themselves
tenaciously. like one of King‘s own clutching
fiends. ‘

John Keenan

King's latest nowl. Christine (published Tn
hardcover by Viking press at $16.95 a
copy). has In its turn. stuck its claws into the
New York Times bestseller list. and is cur-
rently at number eight. Although the premise
of the novel (which concerns a car controlled
by a malevolent spirit) is enough to balk even
the most loyal of fans ("Ah. c'mon. Steve. a
haunted carl”). the novel emerges from this
handicap triumphantly. largely as a result of
King crafting some of the most appealing
characters he's vet produced.

The nucleus of the story is Christine. an
Autumn Red. 1958 Plymouth Fury whose
odometer runs backward. The Fury. whose
radio only seems to play songs like “Teen-
Angel" or “Runaround Sue." is a far cry
from either the Overlook Hotel or the
Marsten House. but it has it‘s memories ——
and ghosts — as well. Arnold Cunningham.
a hapless teen-ager known to his school-
mates as "Ole Pizza-Face," discovers
Christine in a state of wretched disrepair one
.afternoon and. falling in love. promptly buys
her. His friend Dennis. who doesn't like Ar-
nte's new love at all. Is the only one who
seems to notice a strange smell that seems to
be coming from somewhere under
Christine's flooroard.

Enter the third corner of this boy-girl-car
love triangle. and the story begins to com-
pell. Leigh Cabot. "the prettiest girl in
school." is as about as enthusiastic about Ar-
nie’s "other girlfriend" as Dennis; the car
makes both of them uneasy.

 

The events that' comprise the major por-
tion of the work shouldn't suprise any reader
lalready familiar with King's novels; Christine
ibeglns looking newer and newer. “ole pizza-
lface's" complexion starts looking better.
Leigh begins to get worried. and people start
to die.

In Christine. King‘s fondness for working
with young characters (as he did in Carrie
and The Shining) and his skill with them.
become evident. Although the three major
characters — the acne-cursed.sensittve. tn-
telllgent wimp. his football playing best bud-
dy. and "the prettiest girl in the school."
whom they both love —- seem to have step-
ped directly out of the pages of some
unmemorable Juvenile romance. his skill in
handling and creating these characters is
what lifts Christine above mediocrity. The
book is an absolute triumph of characteriza-

quickly overshadowed by his growing obses-
sion with the Fury.

The violence in Christine ts gory.
Although King uses all the finesse he can
muster when portraying the killings. a car
that runs over people Is hard to play down.
Although he mixes his gore with truly profes-
sional horror writing and a great deal of
suspense. i found myself thinking of earlier
works. such as The Shining. where the brutal
bloodiness of the climactic scene had all the
more Impact because It was one of the only
points In the work where actual. physical
violence was used to produce the horror.

Also. of course. when writing about a car

temptation to have the car come crashing In-
to someone's house to do away with them.
King. unfortunatley. succumbs. and the im-
age of an enraged Plymouth Fury rampaging
through a livingroom is one of the most
ridiculous scenes in the book. This is.
however. the only lapse in an otherwise very
skilllul piece of storytelling.

Christine cannot be called one of King's
best efforts. for his best works are much bet-
ter. Nonetheless. while it may fall short of
some of his preceding works. it is still a cut or
three above Carrie and Firestorm. not to
mention Hauling Dragon. or The God Pro-
ject. the two most current offerings‘ from
King's chief competitors. Peter Straub and
John Saul.

subject matter. and most especially in its truly
interesting protaganists. Christina is an en.

was said to be the definitive Jim Morrison

everyone was playing The Doors. even for-

No One Gets Out of lien.- Aiiue became
the bible of the new Doors fan crusade. and
Jim Morrison became its deity. for as it has
been said, dead heroes are the best heroes.
Danny Sugarman. the author of the book.
helped propogate the kind of hysteria that
doomed the craze. with his mystical
lphilosophizing about the present location of
Jim Morrison. The generally sensationalist
approach of the book discredited Sugarman
as a serious observer of not only The Doors,
but of the Doors era as well. And because he
was Morrison's favorite groupie side—kick. it
scented a shame that what must have been
innumerable personal observations of the
band's leader were to be lost in a cloud oi
drooling. slavish Worship. Sugarman's
presentation was exactly the sort of thing that
sabotages sincere and informed observations
about rock and roll.

With the arrival of The Doors: The II-'
Iustmted History. Sugarman's second book
about the band. it seemed at first that Sugar-

. ‘ man was out to milk his association with the
1 band for all It was worth. Here. however. he
- has redeemed himself and saved this book

by keeping bls opinions to himself and simp-

' ly telling it like it is.

in return for being allowed to hang around
with the band. Sugarman was given various
menial tasks to perform. Perhaps the most

 

Joyable book. and an admirable effort. Ci

g .
important of these was the collecting and
assembling of Doors-related press clippings.

‘ These clippings and a surfeit of photographs
form the Illustrated History.

The real interest of the book. however. lies
in its curiosity as a period piece. both for the
reader who was there when it all happened.
as well as for the neophyte wondering what it
was all about. Strong images can be found
throughout the book. images that recapture
the meaning of the mood of the sixties with
jarring impact. In many of the photographs.
members of the band are wearing clothing
that makes today's outrageous styles seem
almost ordinary. Photos and accounts of
i crew-cut policemen arresting Morrison for
charges such as "Public Lewdness" are
strangely shocking now. Viewing them Is
refreshing. serving to remind us that the
under twenty-one population did ac-
complish things during the Sixties. There is a
common tendency today to dismiss the Six-
ties as a naive test. a failed experiment. and
.this lack of appreciation for all that was hap-
pening at the time results in numerous
misconceptions about what rock rnustc and
culture today is attempting to do.

Fortunately. for those of us who np-
lprcciatc Jim Morrison. the book has
moments that demonstrate his intelligence.
an intelligence that was frequently obscured
by his self-abuse and self-indulgent pro
nouncements. Morrison had a Masters from
‘UCLA. and tin.. weaknesses in his work are
more easily attributable to his being caught
up in the mood of the time than to any defl-
clcncy in intelligence or talent. Had he sur-
vived the pressures and abuses of the era. a
more mature Morrison probably would have
risen as one of the elder statesmen of roclt
and roll.

Like most “illustrated histories." the ex-
pense involvud in production results in a
cover price that is discouraging to all but the
most devoted fans. Only a fanatic or a fool
would shell out fifteen bucks for this one;
better to pull it off someone she’s shelf for a
quick browse on a rainy dﬁy.
