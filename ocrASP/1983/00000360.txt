SAN SAL VADOR, El Salvador
(AP)A rightest death squad says it
will try a kidnapped foreign
ministry official for “high
treasom" and leftist rebels are plan-
ning to meet again with tile govern-
tnent peace commission, possibly
on Salvadoran soil.

The Maximilliano Hernandez
Martinez Anti-Communist Brigade.
one of several Salvadoran death
squads. claimed responsibility
Thursday for kidnapping Amilcar
Martinez Arguera, 59. the
ministry's director of economic af-
fairs.

Martinez Arguera was abducted
Tuesday outside his home in the
capital. His wife Gilda. and a
Jaughter were also captured, But
were released a few hours later.

The official once belonged to a
leftist organization, bttt resigned

Salvador official to be ‘ ‘tried’ ’

The two sides ﬁrst meet in Bogota
on Aug. 28.

Francisco Quinonez. head of the
three-man commission, was
unavailable Thursday for comment
on the meeting in El Salvador. peo-
ple who answered the telephone at
his ofﬁce said.

Salvadoran ofﬁcials repeatedly
have said talks only cart serve to br-
ing the left into elections. and they
reject rebel demands that a coali-
tion government be fornted ﬁrst.

ning Central America:

Faculty

Stevens Point, Wisconsin
(CI’S) "We had nothing left to
lose,“ remarks University of
Wisconsin-Stevens Point faculty
member l’cte Kelley, regarding a
controversial ttd which he and 31
fellow instructors recently ran in the
Wall Street Journal.

After "trying all summer to get
people‘s attention" for a new
system-wide salary free/e, Kelley
and his colleagues decided to make
their anger public. They chipped in
$150 for the Attg. 31st ad iii the
natiotutlly-eirculatml business daily.

The two«senlence ad. which tall
in tile “Situations Wanted" section
of the Journal's classifieds, was
headlined "Professors," and read:
"Many professors in all academic
Jisciplincs are available for an
hottest wage at universities with
:ommitmcnl to quality higher
‘tllICiIIlUII. Contact department
:huits at University of Wisconsin
.‘tttttpuscs.”

34:8 million In military aid for
ElSalvador in ﬁscal I984. compared
to 86.3 million sought by President
Ronald Reagan. Congress has ap- ’
proved 8L3 million in aid for the
Salvadoran government this year.
And the Senate intelligence Com-
mittee Thursday night agreed to
release the 19 million Reagan re-
quested for covert aid to anti-leftist
Nicaragan rebels, but said the ad-
ministration must ask before spen-
ding more on the CIA program.
The decision conflicts with a House
vote July 28 to cut off all aid to an
:stimated 7.000 Honduran-based
‘cbeld fighting uttder the
\Jicaraguan Democratic Force. [1]

fed up

needless to say, "were not pleased
with the ad," says Steve
Schumacher, spokesman for the I3
camus Wisconsin system. And the
Executive Faculty Committee at the
main Madisurt campus chastised the
Stevens Point instructors for claim-
ittg to speak for the faculty
members on all campuses.

“Our own view is that the adver-
tisement is inappropriate and self-
defeating." the committee said iii a
letter to the Board of Regents. “We
do ttot believe most faculty
members are prepared to write off
the future of their ttttiversity as
readily as the ad implies."

But Kelley. who is also president
.if the Stevens Point chapter of The
Association of University of
Wisconsin Faculty. says he and
tnany other instructors were serious
about looking elsewhere for
employment.

"We have hundreds and hundreds
of angry faculty members in this
state.“ he says. I l
