Exhibitions by club brings excitement to fair .

A dispute between SUNYA's
Outing Club and Vice President of

-Finance and Business John Har-

tlgan was the only occurrence that
marred Student Association's.
Group Fair Friday.

Tire. sixty funded and ten non-
furtded groups rolled out their
tables and distributed their wares
which included popcorn, soda,
balloons, cotton candy and sign-up
sheets for their respective meetings.

Tire Outing Club ltad a sailboat
iii the fountains and a scheduled
mountaineering demonstration at
the podium wall.

Members of the Outing Club
were preparing to nrake their 5e-
cond descertt down the podltrrn wall
when they were warned by l'lartigatr
not to rape“ down the trniversily
sttttcltlt'c.

According to Outing (‘lub
secretary .lrmet Weber, llartigan

l'ierncy said. He also cited “five to

financial aid process, thus slowing
down a system already glutled with

Solomon. Solomon doesn't care
about eqtral opportunity, racist
laws or trnconstitutlonality. His of-
fice is covered with military posters,
and model l~'-l~l‘s and the like hang
from the ceiling. I hope one day his
voters will come to realize this."

According to l'ierrrey. Solomon's
answer to his question regarding the
amendment was, “it‘s only a
stipulation irt rt mass of federal
regulations, and .slrottld thus not
ltavc much of an impact."

Also lrrsolvctl in the fight for the
amendment‘s repeal is the New
York Public Interest Research

now awaiting the otrtcorne of a still

official permission from his depart-
ment." Weber explained. "As far
as we knew we had permission. Our
rappelers had signed “hold
harmless" forms, which released
the university from any responsibili-
ty. We also made sure to inform the
plant department that we were go-
lrrg down. As far as we were con-
cerncd. we had the go-ahead."

Weber was told by Hartigun in
front of the crowd awaiting the
demonstration that the plant
department had said "no" to the
idea of rapclling.

Hartigan refused to eomtnerrt
Monday on the incident.

“There was a breakdown in corn-
mtrrrication somewhere along the
administrative way," Weber said.

The crowd seemed disappointed
that the Outing Club members were
refused permission to clirtrb dowtr
the podium. “We were disap-
pointed rtot to have it, because it
adds ditttcrrsiotr to the fair. And we
had an offer of media coverage

Weber said.

According to Weber. future

couraging. We're (she arid liar-
tigau) rrreeting to get sotltc sort of

The incident did not seem to
scare away prospective members
from the club's table. Outing Club
President Jeff Gorbaty commented.
“We had 300 people sign an interest

I sheet and 30 people actually paid

their dues on the spot."

Albany State University Black?

Alliance President Eddie Edwards
exclaimed. "We got ‘a good 75 to 80
names. The group fair was very
helpful. It gave trs an opportunity
to reach a large mass of students."

Telethon Co-Chair Amy Zim-
merman commented. "We del'irtitev
ly attracted a large number of irr-
tcrcstcd students to ottr table. it was
a good opporttrrrity to let people
know wlrttt Telethon is all about."

Other feattrres at tile fair includ-
ed a tnartial arts demonstration by
tile Judo (‘ltrh and a performance
by the Dance Council.

According to Director of Student
Programming Richie (iolrrbow, the
cost incurred for the day included
balloons, lrelirun, tables and labor.
The amount. which has rtot yet
been determined, will be paid by
SA‘s Programming ()t'ticc.
