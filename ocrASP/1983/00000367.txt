New York, NY
(CPS) The college guidcbook that
drew the wrath of administrators
across the country a year and a half
ago has just released its sccond cdi-
tion. but with a new name and “a
lot of fine tuning" designed to
pacify many of its critics.

Though it quickly achcivcd salcs
success. the New 'York Times Selec-
tive Guide to Colleges drovc some
administrators to distraction when
it first appeared in February. I982
with a five-star system that ruled
schools as if they wcrc hotels or
restaurants.

But what probably irritatcd thcm
most were the descriptions of the
social and academic climtttcs of 265
)f the nation‘s “best and most in-
'crcsting" four-year schools. '

Of the University of Rhodc
Island. for instance. thc hook quip-

commented. is alright. “but unless
you're intent on making big bucks
in oil. the academic life will be bct-
tcr somewhere else."

Outraged administrators of the
schools receiving such rcvicws
mounted a quick cottntcrattack on
Edward Fiskc. the paper‘s educa-
tion cditor and cditor of the guide.
who assembled the matcriul
published undcr the Times Books
name.

They argued—in letters, inter-
views IInd. in at Icast one instance. a
pcrsonal confrontation in Iiiskc's
lice—that the New York Times int-
primtur Icnt a suggestion of objcc-
tivity to what was actually subjec-
tivc material.

Fiskc based his review of the
schools on responses to ques-
tionuircs hc scnt students on catch of
the campuses.

80.000 copies of the books were
sold.

Times Books officials say they
hope to match that record with the
second edition.

To help get there. Fiskc has tried
to blunt the controversy before the
book's official September 28
publication date by altering his
grading system and treading a little
tnurc softly on the reputations of
the schools that complained loudly
in 1982.

Moreover. the new edition—dub-
bed The Sclcctivc Guide to Col-
leges—dropped ull rcfcrcnccs to the
Times in its title.

The star rating system has been
Itltcrcd, notes Times Books publist
Sturdy liruwursky. “to discourage
pcoplc from munbcricully rating
schools on the basis of how many
slurs they got in It ccrttlin area."

The first ctlition owztrdcd schools

In the new edition. Fiskc uscs

Among the less visible changes.

to confront Fiskc personally over

Fiskc also gave some schools bet-

The academic ratings for the
Unlvcrsitlcs of Nebraska and
