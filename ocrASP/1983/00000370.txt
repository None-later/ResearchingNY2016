history as the first college to require
all cntcring freshmen to buy not on-
ly paper. pens and textbooks. but
microcomputers.

A week later. Stcvcns Institute of
Technology In New Jcrscy became
the second school to impose ilic
new requirement.

And more are enlisting in thc
long-touted campus computer
revolution each term.

This winter. Drcxci University in
Philadelphia will require its
freshmen to buy a new wondcr Ap-
ple computer. which collcgc officals
grandly call the Apple-DU.

Even more — all of them private
colleges —— are only months from
similar steps: Carnegie-Mellon.
Brown. MIT. Pcppcrdine. Vassar.

Dartmouth and the Rochester In-.
stitute of Technology, to name a‘
few. .

“What's happening at Stevens'-
and Clarkson mcrcly heralds what is
to come." predicts Alfred Bork. a
physics and computer science pro-
fessor at thc University of
California-Irvine. "I think we all
agree that the day is near when all
students will be rcquircd to bring
computers with ilicm to campus.”

The remaining questions seem to
be just how and why that will hap-
pcn. what the costs will be. how the
computers will affect cvcrydny cam-
pus life. and. as Bork points out, if
educators can actually create
courscs that will use tltc machines.

“It's one thing for everyone to
come to campus with a certain piece
of hardware." he says. "It's
another to make llicm useful, and
to design a curriculum around
them. That will take a while, and it
doesn’t happen automatically."

Clarkson. for example. lacks not
only a campus network to link its
computers but even phones in tlic
dormrooms. There are no courses
designed speciﬁcally for using the
computers yet.

“Unfortunatcly, about all I can
say at this point is that, among
schools implementing computer
programs, the variety Is enormous.
the interest is enormous. and the
confusion is enormous." says
Steven Gilbert. director of tlic
EDUCOM Computer Literacy Pro--
jcct, which is trying to link wholc
campuses to each other.

"The cost is also enormous."
