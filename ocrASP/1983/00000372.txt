Reagan cuts education spending

WASHINGTON. D. C.
tCPS)Spending on education and
social services programs has drop-
ped almost 20 percent since the
Reagan administration took office
in l98l, a Congressional Budget
Office (CBC) report has found.

And in a new American Federa-
tion of Teachers (AFT) analysis of
federal education spending. AFT
President Albert Shanker charges
President Reagan with "a
cover-up" of administration fun-
ding requests for education pro-

grams.

The AFT has been friendlier to
the president than other education
groups in the past. It gave President
Reagan a respectful welcome at its
June, 1983 convention and willingly
participated in his White. House
conference in the wake of last spr-
ing’s release of several reports
criticizing the qttality of American
education.

By contrast. tlte National Educa-
tion Association — the AFT's
larger teachers’ union rival — refus-

ed to join the White House con-
ference or invite the president to
speak at its convention, claiming
Reagan had failed to support
education since his days as governor
of California.

The AFT also has been more will-
ing to entertain the notion of merit
pay for elementary and secondary
school teachers, a measure Pres-
dlcnt Reagan supports.

But the new AFT "analysis"

noted President Reagan had asked .

Congress to cut federal public

education by 25 percent for 1982
and 48.3 percent for this fiscal year.
Congress eventually granted the
president an ill percent cut for 1982
and an 18.6 percent cut for I983.
“Barnstorming around the coun-
try, the president has embraced the
‘Back to Basics‘ theme of the Na-
tional Commission on Excellence in
Education with a fervor he once
reserved for his ‘New Federalism’
initiative," Shanker writes‘ in a
summary accompanying a
breakdown of lrow much federal
education money each state lost in
the ﬁrst two Reagan budgets.
"But his crusade is a cover-up,"
he adds.
The CEO —— the office that does

 

most of the financial budget
analysis for Congress —- found the
government is spending about 20
percent less on some education pro-
grams than it promised to back in
198].

For example, the government will
spend some 27.5 percent less on
Guaranteed Student Loans between
1982 and I985 than Congress
ordered it to in laws pascd in 1980.

All student aid programs are full-
ing short of spending mandates. the
CEO said in its report to House
Speaker Tip O’Neill (D-MA) last
week.

answer, even if it means usin
force.”

The Auburn study shows that
most of the time neither male nor
female considers that a rape has oc-
curred, Keller continues, “because
of the traditional concept of rape as
a situation where somebody grabs
you off the sidewalk and attacks
you.”

Burkhart calls the results of his
study both “surprising and distress-
ing" because “they indicate that
there's still a great deal of rape scn~
timent among males in otrr
society."

Keller believes that for every case
of reported student rape by a
stranger, "there are dozens of crises
of acquaintance rope that weren't
reported."

Burkirart

agrees, saying that
