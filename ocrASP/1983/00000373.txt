but at least the conﬁdence is there now."
For the Danes the future is very challeng-
ing. in the next two weeks they travel to
' Union and Southern Connecticut. Union is
2.0 and has only given up seven points this
season while scoring 64. Southern Connec-
ticut is a Division II school and defeated the
Danes in Albany last year on the infamous
Steve Compitello kickoff return with 25
seconds left in the game. depriving Albany of

 

Syracuse
(AP)Although No. l-ralcd Nebraska has
four-game statistics to rival the season totals
of most learns. Syracuse (‘oaclr Dick Mac-
Phcrson isn't conceding anything to the Cor-
nhuskcrs except the cnorruity of the challenge
they pose.

“I’m not going to tell you how good
Nebraska is. They have p.t'. people for that.
After the game I'll tell yotr how good they
are. After the game is what counts." he said
Monday.

Syracuse takes a 3-1 record and a three-
game winning streak irrlo the game at I.in-
coln.Neb., the first two squads since l‘)(yI-thc
last year Nebraska had a losing season.

averages of 56.5 points, 437 yards and 617

not bothered to put a line of the game

showed emotion and control at the same time
and drew on the character which emerged
during last week's 17-13 victory over Rutgers.

“What happens during the game deter-
. mines the emotion you're going to have." he

said. “You see a Nebraska and they‘ll be

fumbling all over the place. down 10-0 to

UCLA. a 42-10 victim last week. and they're

not even concerned. where some teams. i.c..

Syracuse or Kent State in the same

sitrration...you get a Professor Harold Hill

and get some tr'omboncs out just to keep
them alive.”

The youthful Syracuse team dropped its

« first contest l7-8 to Temple before beating

perennial doprmats Kent State and Nor-

thwestern and edging Rutgers. The Orange

are averaging 20 points and 33.5 yards a

game.

Cornhuskcr Conch ’l‘om Osborne has said

he doesn't believe his club met a great oppo-

' ncnt indecisive wins over Penn State, Wyom-

ing, Minnesota and UCLA. He wouldn't

characterize Syracuse art such a team either.

think they're going to be a vcry good oppo-
ncnt.” he added.

Osborne cited Penn State, which lost its
next two games after a 44-6 beating by
Nebraska. as an example of a strong tcarrr
which gambled with the schedule anti lost
momentum.

“I think probably the game didn't \L’I‘\‘L'
them very well." he said of the Nittany
Lions' l-3 start. “it was a gamble. We also
had reservations about whether the game
should be playcd that early in the season. and
I think the fact that we won by a fair margin
probably did set them back.”

Macl’herson, whose team is an arch-rival
of Penn State, said both schools probably
“cried all the way to the bank“ after the na-
tionally televised contest.

“We learned what it takes to win in that
situation," he said. To upset the (‘or-
nlruskcrs. his team would have to play an
error-free game, take advantage of any
Nebraska mistakes and play with “emotion
and intensity" the full 60 minutes. he said.

“I tlrink this about Division I I-A football
and parity. Tire emotional team has a
chance," Macl’hcrsou added. “On the Divi-
sion I level. usually there are crrorrglr good
players that it" enough mistakes are made by
one favored learn, you have a chance to
win."

lie ahead later this week. the Danes will be in
for quite a match when they host local rival
RPl this Thursday. The Danes have topped
the Engineers for four straight years but the
two teams looked equal this past weekend as
evidenced by their second place tic in the
Dane Classic.

Said RPI coach Koosmarr: “I think it
could go 5-4 either way. It's going to be a
really tight meet."

Couch Scrbnlik agreed: “I think it will be
close but if my players perform to the
abilities that they can perform at. we‘ll take
it."

The Danes. who arc H in dual mccts. had
a match postponed yesterday against
Oswego. due to heavy rains in the Oswego
