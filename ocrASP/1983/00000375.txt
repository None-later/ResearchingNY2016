in a sloppy football game that
featured l0 turnovers. the Albany
State Great Danes managed to cross
the goal line for the first time this
season and break into the win col-
trmn while the Brockport State
Golden Eagles were held scoreless
and remained winless Saturday
afternoon on University Field.

“Two not very good football
teams struggllrtg to give the game
away." Albany Head Coach Bob
Ford said.

Albany quarterback Mike
Milano. a sophomore. made his
first start a successful one by throw-
ing for one touchdown in pilotittg
the Danes to the 28-0 victory.

Led by runningbacks Scott
Reagan nttd John Dunham the
Danes rushed for 3l3 yards. it was
the first time in three games this
season Albany's wishbone attttck
ran for over lOO yards. Reagan's
two touchdowns. on runs of two
and 40 yards rnidwny through the
fourth quarter. put the game ottt of
reach.

The Danes scored their first
touchdown of the year at the 8:51
mark of the second quarter when
Milano rolled left and found Bob
Brien 25 yards away in the corner of
the end zone. This was the only
scoring in the first half.

“That one felt good." Mllano
said. “it was a three receiver route.
Bobby was not the primary
receiver. he was the last one. The
play was designed to go in the fiat."

The start of the third quarter was
indicative of the type of game being
played. Within the first seven and a
half minutes there Were t‘tve tur-

Dane cornerback Jimmy Collins.
The official right on top of the play
ruled Ellis out of bounds and the
pass incomplete. giving Albany the
ball on downs.

"i thought Brockport got hosed
out of it." Ford said. "i thought it
was a completion."

Brockport Head Coach Keith
Moody agreed. "it looked good itt

long time. ltt my experience. at ttrty
level. if the receiver is carried orrt of

for two plays that would deterntine
the outcome of the game.

On fourth down. Brockport sent

Rob Karen and the men's tennis team placed second this weekend
as they hosted the Great Dane Ctaeelc.

 

By Marc Bermen
STAFF WRITER

On a weekend ﬁlled with perfect weather and a
display of tennis to match. the Albarty State men‘s ten-
nis team placed in an impressive three-way tte for se-
cond place. in the lt‘rteam. seventh annual. Great
Dane Classic.

The Dane's second place ﬁnish was their highest
placement in the history of the tournament. which was
held on the Albarty State campus this past Friday and
Saturday. . ‘

A total of 16 points tied the Dane trcttnctl \vrth tltcrr
local rival R.l’.l. and Williams College.

The University of Vermont placed first. capturing
their first Dunc Classic crowrt by compiling 23 points.

For the first tirttc in the Classic‘s history. Albtrrty
Coach Bob Lewis wasn‘t rrrtrttirrg the tourney. Lewis.
who underwent back surgery last week which will
sideline ltirtt for the full season. was rcplttccd as tour-
nrrtuent director by lotrg-tirttc friend and rival R.l’.l.
coach, Steve Koosmrru.

Koosmurt volunteered for tire job and his selection
was based on experience.

“i thought he (Koosrrtau) did art outstanding job."
said Albany's irttcrirrr cotrclr for tire full season Jim
Scrlutlik. "His experience really showed through. The
tournament didn't skip a bent.“

l\'oosmttu cited other factors that made tltc tourna-
rrtcrtt successful including the “gorgeous wctuhcr“ rind
the "outstanding facilities at the Albany L‘tlttlpilti."

Going ittto the tournament. cottclr Sctlrulik wasn‘t
sure how well his yotrng tertnt Would fair.

“in the pre-tourrtumcut meeting it secured that the
other couches did rtot tlrirtk the Duties would‘lutvc
rtttrclr say in the tournament.“ said Scrbtillk. “i'll ud-
rrtit that l was just us surprised that we did so well cou-
sidcriug the bud ltrck we‘ve ltrrd iii the trust irt this
tourney."

The “bad luck" Setbrtlik was referring to was the
rough drttw tltc Danes usually woutrd up with. This

year it was no different as four of the six Albany
singles players were slated against the top seeds in their
respective brackets.

Number two singles Tom Schmitz. number live
singles Jay Eisenberg and number one singles Dave
Ulrich all dropped tough opening rottrtd matches. but
cattle brick to take their consolation match. which pro-
ved to be the key in the team's second place ﬁnish.

Number six singles Mike Dermansky showed great
cotrrtigc despite losirtg his opening round match as the
sophtttorc played with ttrr injured ankle. He was trouble
to pltty his consolation match which proved crucial. A
Dcrrnnnsky victory could have given the Danes sole
pos ssion of second place.

The two Danes that carried Albttrry through the
tournament were number three singles Rob Karen and
number fottr singles Drive Grossruan. who won their
respective brackets by sweeping their fotrr matches.
