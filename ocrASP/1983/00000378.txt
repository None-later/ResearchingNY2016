He was told to tense and then
relax a series of different muscles in
the body. Over a period of weeks
this exercise created a state of relax-
ation and the migraine headaches
that Jeff Cardiac. an eighth grader
from Niskayuna. suffered from
slowly disappeared.

"Now i just turn off the TV. turn
on some music and relax;
sometimes i fall asleep," said Car-
dini.

What Cardini is involved in is a
new technique being studied by
psychologist Frank Andrasik.
former member of the SUNYA
Psychology Department. now
Associate Director of the Stress
Disorders Clinic located in Draper
Hall.

This relaxation procedure relieves
severe headaches, sometimes
migraines. and teaches the patient.
after a series of visits. how to relax
the entire body to relieve the stress't
that causes chronic headaches. An-
dt‘asik said.

"When you tcnsc a muscle and
then relax it. it goes to a more relax-
ed lcvel." he said. “We view these
treatments that we do as acquiring
skills. The patients learn how to-
do it for themselves." he added.
‘I'This is a skill. the more they do it
the easier it is for theta." he said.

When Cardinl first visited the
research facilities of the Stress
Clinic last Fall. Andrasik said. he
was put through a series of inter-
views and examinations to assess his
condition. Andrasik explained that
first he was psychologically tested
to determine his emotional state
and then given a thorough medical
exam to determine whether or not
his migraines may have been the
result of a tumor or other physical
complications.

Nexf came the sessions that
taught Cardini how to relax. Aa-
drasik noted. These sessions were
taped so that he could listen to the
psychologists' instructions and

but dangerous and continued by
defining the task for this University
to include educating people to learn
respect for each other.

In an emotion packed speech.
keynote speaker Burstcin asked.
“How long must we struggle?"
Burstcin stressed tch importance of
seeing violence as a womens issue.
though agreeing with O'Lcary in
pointing out that then had a definite
role in the struggle for women's
safety. She provided a vision of
women's safety that went beyond
the idea that rape and assault com-
prise the principle
violence.

Citing economic conditions and
poverty as rclatcd to violence
against women. littrstcin asked.
“Why spend millions on in—
strumcnts of destruction to add to
what violence already exists?"
Willi that she stressed the impor-
tance ol~ also thinking of war as a
women's issue. She reiterated what
l’ost said earlier: get rid of jokes
about the roles of women as
drivers. as what they are good for.
as 35 year old women referred to as
“girls in the office." as victims of
rape.

in what was perhaps the most
cmotiontll part ot'thc opening hour.
Post was presented with a loaf of
bread. surrounded by roses. for her
part in womens sat‘cty. Said thirs-
(cin. in later comments. “we must
have more titan just bread; hopeful»
ly our efforts will assure us all a day
when we will haVc bread and
roses." l 1

reproduce the relaxed state at
home. he explained.

After a ten-week period it was
natural. ” Now i don't have to do it
anymore." said Cardinl. At about
this time he found out that the
technique really worked. especially
after he didn't have to use the tape
recorder anymore. he added.
"About twice a month i would have
headaches." he said. "now i
haven't had one in months."

Andraski has been studying and
treating youngsters in a research
setting since the three-year project
started I8 months ago. About50
children. mostly from the Capital
District area. have taken advantage
of the program so far. Andrasik
said.

But not all of the younger pa-
tients respond well to the program.
explained Andrasik. "We are not
really sure why, mostly it has to do
with the fact that they don’t stick to
it." he said.

However. 60 to 80 percent of the
youngsters in the new program have
experienced headache relief. accor-
ding to information published by
the clinic.

Along with the relaxation techni-
que. the clinic is also studying a
biofeedback procedure that in-
volves raising the temperature of
the hands. "This relieves
headaches but we are not sure
why." says Andrasik.

When you concentrate on warm-
ing the hands. he explained. it in-
creases the blood flow to them. “it
was formerly thought that this
decreases the blood flow .in the
brain. thus causing the relief but we
have found that this is not true."
he added.

The problem of chronic
headaches is much more corn-
plicated than formerly though. ex-
