By Jon thlmott

Capitol Park. Albany will be the
site of one of 250 sites in the first
ever series of national nuclear
.frecze walks. Albany Mayor

Thomas Wltalcn III will start off

the walkers who are joining
together to call for a halt to tile
rrtlclear arms race. The free/e walk
or “stroll” as it was referred to by
Jeanne (‘asatcili. walk coordinator
for the Upper Hudson Nuclear
Weapons I-‘reelc ('ruupaign is slated
to begin at It) a.m.. October I and
will cover 6.2 miles through
Albany.

The Capitol Park walk is one of
eight plarrtted for the 13rd arid 24th
congressional districts and one of
250. simultaneous walks nation-
wide. Walks will be held in 4t states
with ll heirtg held irr New York
State alone. (‘asatclli ttotcd.

The walk coordittator explained
that the purpose of the walks is
three-fold: to reflect universal sup-
port for the discontinuation of the
nttclear arms race. to involve new
people who would otherwise not get
involved in the campaign. attd to
raise tuttch needed funds for both
the local and national movements.
Casatelli felt the walks would "hr-
ing a sense of trope to the freeze
movement.”

Sayitrg that for rrrany people. this
would he the “first citance to stand
up and be counted." (Tasatelli ex-
pressed optirnistn cottcerning the
turnout. She added that people of

peeled to participate in the walk.
Many rest arid drink stops will be
provided alortg the way site explain-
cd. For those people who want to
participate httt cannot complete the
entire walk. a shuttle service will he
provided at frequent irttervals. she
noted. “We want people to show by
their presence that the freeze is a
force to be reckoned with." aspired
Casatclli. The freeze campaign is
considered. by many, to he the
largest movement in America to-

day. she aIItrtned.

Casatelli said that despite eit-
thnsiasm concerning the walk, cori-
troversy has ttot eluded the cata-
paign. A local Shenendoah High
School teacher. Mary Provost was
called a ‘comtnimist' in a letter to
the editor which appeared in the
Schenectady Gazette. The (‘Iit‘ton
Park authors felt that by placing iri-
formation about the freeze walks
on the walls of the school. the
teacher was proliferating corn-

    

utunist activities. livery hit of infor-
mation. save one poster. was subse-
quently removed asserted (Tasatelli.

When asked to reply to the
charges that the free/c movement
was contrrutnist related. Casatelli
flatly responded. “Iloldcrdash.”
She added, "We rtre concerned
ahottt American Security."

The t‘rcc/e movement is by no
conception made tip of a few
radicals. she noted. Polls show that
70 percent of the American public

favor a freeze in the arms race. Peo-
ple in support of the freeze include
William Colby (former director of
the CIA), Pattie Davis (Ronald
Reagan's daughter), Reverend Billy
Graham, and many other notable
Americans. Casatelli added.

All eight local marches will
follow the same time schedule with
registration at 9:00. rally at 9:30
and the 6.2 mile walk at 10:00 am.
The rally for the Capitol Park
march will be highlighted by folk
songs froth Roger Mock and a
speech by Mayor whalen. After the
walk, anotltcr rally will transpire
with assemblyman Maurice itin-
chcy, chairman of the environmen-
tal committee and noted t'olk artist
Ruth Pelham leading the crowd.
Participating groups include the
Rensselacr (‘ounty Peace Coalition.
the Saratoga I’cace Alliance. several
professional. labor attd religious
groups and many more.

The other seven capitol area
walks are being held in Troy.
Delmar, Clifton Park.
Voorheesvitle. (iuildertand.
Saratoga and Schenectady. As a
closing comment, Casatelli declared
"You cart make a difference but
you have to net."

Upcoming events planned by the
Upper Hudson Nuclear Freeze
(‘ampaign include; the opening of
an Interfaith Center for Peace on
Oct. 7. a Liala Opening Party for
the center on Oct. 28 and on
November I a Peace Breakfast. For
