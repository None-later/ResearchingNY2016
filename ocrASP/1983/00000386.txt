university dorm as she expected.

To Zlcari. it's great. In fact. "I'd
never go back to the dorms if i
didn't have to. Here, you don’t
have to worry about doing your
towels or linens. and a maid comes
in every day and cleans the place

H

up.

But to Marquette ofﬁcials, it's a
terrible situation. Besides placing

Zicarl and 29 other women sludents

in the Continental Hotel, they‘ve

had to rent additional floors of a
hcarby YMCA and convert dorm
lobbies into temporary living
quarters for new students.

The cost is significant. The
damage to a shool's reputation as a
desirable. comfortable place to
study can be bigger.

But a number of schools across
the country are sustaining such
damage. as dorm officials are being
surprised at the number of students
who have shown up asking to move
into dorms in recent weeks.

Besides Marquette. Middle Ten-
nessee State. Western Michigan,
Iowa State. Connecticut, West
Liberty State. Notrc Dame and
Oklahoma. among others. unex-
pectedly have run out of dorm
space.

“Most of the Big Ten schools are
pretty much at capacity or in need
of special housing for their
overflow." reports Gary North.
housing director at the University
of Illinois and past president of the
Association of College and Univer-
sity Housing Officers (ACUHO).

"And most of the larger state
universities are in similar cir-

 

 

cumslnnccs," he adds. "Little and
private schools may be experiencing
a surplus of dorm space. but even
some of them are having overﬂows
this year."

It wasn’t supposed to be like this.

Virtually all long-term predictions
of enrollments in the l980's showed
the college population dropping off
precipitously. Many campus of-
ficials shied away from building
new dorms. fearful they'd be left
vacant after the decline scheduled
to start in fall. wt“, and to ac-
celerate after that.

Some schools even closed existing
dorms over the last several years at
lhe first hint of enrollment decline.

But the decline. despite the
decrease in the number of
l8-24-ycar-olds In the general
population, is on hold. The college
population. which peaked at [2.4
million last year. is expected to stay
at or near that level throughout the
decade, the National Center for
Education Statistics now predicts.

Moreover. the continually rising
price of off-campus housing around
the country has convinced more
students to choose dorms over
apartments. The result: an unan-
ticiputed increase in the number of
dorm residents this fall.

“We keep waiting for things to
level off like they're supposed to,
but it's not happening," sald Mar-
quette spokesman Dave Foran.

Western Michigan closed three
dorms over the last few years. but
has had to re-open two of its Valley
ll projects to absorb this fall's in-
crease in dorm requests.

Oklahoma. despite an overall
enrollment decline of 400, also has
re-opcned a dorm it shut down last
year. and has made some double
rooms in existing dorms into triples.

rooms at the Student Union. At one
facility. 19 men have to share two
showers.

Over 100 lSU students couldn’t
even get temporary housing.

Dorms are more crowded where
rates are low. "At schools where“
the rates have gone up, the increases
(in occupancy) have been much
more modest ths year," says ll-
linois' North.

"Nationally, I'd say (dorm) rates
are up about three to seven
percent." says Annette Smith. cur-

the following Monday, Schaffer
said he accepted lluce late applica-

deadline for SA applicalions is one

mcnt.

Al the Council meeting, ad-
vocalcs of Auicua's appointment

her experience was Ihe most

director. slated "SA is a political
organization".conlacts arc nol casi-
ly made. If Sury Aulclta lefl it
would undermine cvcrylhing done

Off-Campus (‘erllral (‘ouncil
representative David Silk argued
the reason Aulelta had prior ex-
perience was because of her up-
ooinlmenl in the spring and that
:recause of this she had closed
everyone out of the interview pro-

cess. Silk added that “the connec-
tions Sury established would still be
open between lhe ()(‘A office and
the cily."

Silk said he did not personally
feel dissatisfied with Aulella's ap-
pointment and that he felt she
would do a good job. Cole Inter
voiced the same sentiments but add-
ed that the ()(7(‘ interviews "set a
dangerous precedent for future ap-
pninlmcnls, if it is done in this
fashion."

Debate also arose over appoin-
ting au oil-campus sludt‘nl lo repre-
sent off-campus consllluents.
When asked how living on Dulch
Quad affected her ability to repre-
sent off-campus studenls, Aulctln
replied. “ it makes no difference at
all. It's‘ convenient to live on can»
pus. I'm very accessible to the of-

Aulella also added that off-
campus students are getting more
attention now than ever before.

' Schools nationwide running out of dorm space

MIL WA UKEE. WI
(CPS) Barb Zicarl. a history major
at Marquette University. found
herself stuck in a rented hotel room
this fall. instead of moving into a

ofﬁcial at West Virginia. Last
year’s housing costs went up 11-12
percent.

"i think many schools have final-
ly caught up” with skyrocketing
energy costs suffered in the seven-
ties. she says. "We're hoping to
hold our rates slcndy for at least the
next year."

Not all schools have them. “It's a
very mixed, mixed-up plcturc~thls
year." Smith summarizes.

Four more off-campus council
members are to be elected. along
with is off-campus students to
()CA’s board of directors. accor-
ding to Aulella.
