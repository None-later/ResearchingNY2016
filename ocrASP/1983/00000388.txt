Wednesday night the Albany State women's volleyball team eon-
tlnued its winning ways by thrashing the College of Saint Rose i5-4.
IS-o, IN. The win raises the team's record to 6 wins and two losses
J for the season.

: g It was no contest right from the start as the Danes jumped to an "-0
lead to the first game behind the excellent serving of highly recruited
freshman Patty Munhall. The out-classed Saint Rose team was never
v able to get going as Albany dominated the action throughout the
3' match. The Danes Were led by last year's ail-state performer Li:

Women’s soccerteam wins

By Mark Wllgard

.8 DIN“ It'll] II.

 

Before the season began. head
coach Amy Kidder said that her
women's soccer learn would be “the
learn to watch" tItls year. After
yesterday's 3-0 drttbhing of the
Siena lndians, tltere seems to be
every indication that Kidder was
right.

Albany raised its record to 4-2 as
they dominated the 0-4 Indians
throughout most of the gantc. Co-
captain Dee Marfc opened the scar-
ing at 5:” of the first half with an
inassisted goal.

Marfe had not played the
previous week due to an ankle in-
jury. but she returned in splendid
fashion. Kidder noted that "Marfe
did a great job. hustling allover the
field."

The Danes made it 2-0 when Jenv
nlfer Jones tallied on a pass from
Kim Kosalek. Kidder was ecstatic
over the play of Jones. “Jennifer
saw only limited action. but i was
very happy with her passing game.
It was one of her most solid perfc r-
mances of the year."

Albany completed the one-sided
half as co-captaln Karen Smith
scored with just under four minutes
to play. That made it 3-0. and Siena
was done for the day. Sometimes.
shots on goal are not an indication
of the score of the game. but the
Zl-l halftime advantage for the
Danes in that department clearly in-
dicated that Siena was overmateh-
ed.

The second half featured sloppy
play on the part of both teams. The
Danes were clearly the better squad,
but the fundamental errors. such as
going offsides numerous times, cut

down greatly on the Albany scoring
opportunities. Kidder noted that
“They (Siena) hadn't been getting
the ball down in our end the second
half. and we still laid back and
played defense. We shOuld have
pounded them." She also added
that "We had a lot of balls squirt
through into ottr end; there was no
reason for that to happen."

Other Great Danes turning in
solid performances were Sue Slagel,
who did a great job at striker and
midfielder and Kosalek who was

Kidder. Tracy Knattl and Cathy

as they had to face only four shots

Led by second singles Mindy Hartslcin.
who won lter match 7-5. 60. third singles
Joan Phillips. who won 6-0. 6-]. and fourth
singles Ellen Yum. 3-6. 6-4. 6-0. the Danes
completed a four game sweep to put them at
the top of their division.

Contributing to the victory were Janet
Snow and Nancy Forbes. whose doubles vic-
tory (6-I. 6-4) helped offset losses by ﬁfth
singles Ann Rapisalda. doubles tandem
Helene Tischler and Lauren lsaacs. and first
singles Deb Leffe. Leffe. who has been
bothered by tendonltis. dropped a tough
match to Julie Miller. fifth-ranked in the
state. by the score of 6 -3. 6 - 3.

The road ahead for the team is not an easy
one. This weekend coach Mari Warner is
headed for the Eastern Collegiates at West
Point with ﬁrst and third singles. Deb chfe
and Joan Phillips. and the doubles learn of
Tischler and issues to compete in a tourna-
mcttt against other colleges along the L‘ilSlct‘tl

Booters lose

 

By Mark Levine
zlSSUl‘I/i IE SPORTS EDIION

 

Dipping below the .500 mark for the first
time since their opening game loss to
Oswcgo. the Albany State men‘s soccer team
dropped another clit‘lhangcr in the filial
minutes on Wednesday. this time losing to
North Adams on the road by a score of Z-l.

The winning goal came with l:()l remain-
ing in regulation time, the second game irt a
row the Danes have lost in the final minutes.
Last Saturday. Albany fell to Cortland by a
i-O score. with the winning goal coming with
2:59 showing on the clock. The Dancs‘
record is now 2-3.

Midfielder Jeff Hackctt scored the only
goal of tire game for Albany as he tallied on a
penalty kick in the ﬁrst half. Hackctt’s goal.
his second of the year. made the score l-l.
Albany Head Coach Bill Sehicffctin praised
Hackctt for his recent play.

“Jeff has been playing just super for us."
Schicffclin said.“Hc's been playing with
three or four guys on his back and is still
creating a lot of opportunities. He should
have had four assists yesterday."

The Danes’ biggest problem this year is
very simple: they have been having a great
deal of trouble finishing off their plays and
putting the ball in the net. Throw out a 6-0
win over Manhattanvillc in the second game

The road behind them wasn't an easy one
either. The Danes came into this season with
a lot of question marks. Would the learn int-
prove on its sub-.500 record of 1982? Could
rookie Coach Warner lead her women to the
top? These questions probably won't be
answered until the season is over. However.
with each win. the team moves closer to the
right answers.

Their promising season began with a 7-!
thrashing of Sienna with singles victories by
chfe, Phillips. Hartstein. issacs and Yum.
Tire blowout prompted Warner to comment.
‘This kind of win early in the year is good for
us." After a rainout in Oneonta. the Danes
quickly disposed of Plattsburgh 7-2 with vic-
tories by l-iartstcin and Phillips in singles and
another win by them in doubles. in titeir
third tnatclt. Albany was put to tire test by a
strong Potsdam team. A grueling four-hour
wirt by number one Deb Leffc arid a three-set
doubles win by Hartstcin and Phillips helped
edge Potsdam 5-4.

ilow far Warner's troops can go remains
to be seen, “We have a lot of depth and the
girls are playing well. We'll just have to take
it game by game." cottttrtcttted the ctr-
thusiastic Warner. And that's how tltc

ing: game by game, win by win.

to N. Adams

of the season. and you have a team that has
scored a total of three goals in the other four
games. if Albany is to make a run at the con-
fcrcncc championship. tltcy must start to
develop some more production offensively.

"We‘re making some basic technical
mistakes shooting." Schicffclin said. “it
scents like guys are getting a little trcrtous
arid cdgy when they're gcttirtg chances to
score. i think the insufficicncics arc more
I psychological than physical."

The overall lack of production from tltc
offense has prtt a great deal of ptcssttrc on
the defense. according to Albany Assistant
Coach llill Steffen.

"When the attack goes well. the defense
goes well also." he said. “Yesterday. the at-
tack wus good in the first half btrt l‘cll ottt of
synch iii the second half. When the attack
falls apart. it puts a lot of pressure on the
defense. it's very difficult for a defense to
withstand pressure for art entire half."

One thing the Danes do have going for
them is their rcmaitting schedule. After just
returning front their fourth road game iii a
now. Albany Will‘plity six of its final eight
games at home. The first of these will be on
Saturday at 2:00 against lirockport State.

"We‘ve got to get our confidence back,"
Schicffelin said. “Winning teams play with
