About 200 people gathered on
the steps of the Capital building in
Albany Saturday for the start oi
one of 250 nationwide nuclear
freeze walks.

Excited whispers filled the air in

anticipation as Albany Mayor
Thomas Whaien III greeted the
walkers who had joined together to
call for a Itait of the nuclear arms
race. .
Whaien said he fully endorsed the
freeze campaign. arid that he hoped
“great. glorious things" \vould oc—
ettr as a result of the walk.

James Dricoil, head of the Upper
Hudson Nuclear iirccze Campaign.
read a letter written by the late
Mayor Erastus Cot nng II, which in
effect. advocated all measures
taken by Americans to halt the pro-
duction of nuclear weapons. (‘orn-
itlg wrote that he saw the need to
"save the world from disaster” by
eventually eliminating nttciear
weapons altogether.

The group. consisting of citizens
of all ages. began the 6.2-milc walk
through Albany promptly after
Witalert finished speaking shortly
after I0.

The ciottdy skies overhead didn‘t
put a damper on the march itself.
bttt scented instead to add to the air
of dctertnination towards the
nuclear arrtts question. Jeanne
Casatelii. walk coordinator for the
Upper Hudson Nuclear Weapons
Freeze Campaign. noted that for
many people. the walk was the
"first chance to stand tip attd be
counted."

Patricia Beetle. head chairperson
for the Upper Hudson Campaign.
said she was extremely happy with
the turn-out and enthusiasm of the

marchers. “It seems like a good.
positive thing to be involved in."
.she said. "People are beginning to
realize that building weapons
should be halted altogether. There
are many tnore positive things to do
with all the money spent rather than
the negative things which are being
done now."

When asked what the over-all ob-
jective of the nuclear freeze cant-
paign is. Hectic immediately
replied. “to freeze nuclear weapons
in a mutual unifiable way. with the
United States and Soviet Union."
Beetle stressed that botit sides must
halt production in order for the
goal to be a reality.

On 0 tobcr 6. I683. thirteen
Mennonite families established the
first permanent German settlements
in the US. The settlements are at
Germantown. currently a
Philadelphia suburb. Professor
Wolfgang Moeiickcn. Chairperson
of the German department. has
spent the last si.\tccn ycars recor-
ding and studying this group. which
is called the “Pennsylvania (Ier-
mans."

Mocllekcn has intensified his ef-
forts to record and analyze the
variations of "Pennsylvania Ger-
man" (often called Pennsylvania
Dutch) as the 300th anniversary of

 

of grants frotn the American Coun-
cil of Philosophic Societies.

Mociiekcn tnaintains that there is
"great urgency to record these
dialects because there is dattgcr that
they will die out." It took awhile
for him to gain the confidence of
the families. “It helps if yott know
Pennsylvania German.“ says Pro-
fessor Moelicken. “You have all
immediate rapport. it also helps if
you have contacts; otherwise they
don't open tip. You're dealing with
a society that doesn't believe in with
the worldly."

Titc Amish people are the tnost
known of the groups. "The Amish
use no electricity and drive no cars.
They use a horse and buggy for

“... record these dialects
because there' is a danger

they will die out. ”
—Prof. Wolfgang Moe/lerert

 

Germans settling America ap-
proaches. He has spent the last I6
years living with and studying
groups like the Amish and Old
Order Mennonites.

Moeileken was bortt in Germany
and arrived itt the United States in
1957. He itas a Ph.i). in Philology
and Linguistics. In I979. he catne to
the University as the Chairman of
the German Languages and
Literature Department.

He is at the midway point of a
two-year. “67,000 project. which
was funded by the National iindow-
ment for the I-iumanities. Addi-
tional support has come in the form

transportation. The women cover
their heads, and the men wear dark
clothes. They are baptized at
adulthood," Muelleken explained.
The Amish are the fastest-growing
of the sects with a birthrate of 6.5
children per family, and with a
population of over 100.000 that live
in 25 states. including New York.
according to Mocliekcn.

As a result of his work. a center
for German Speech islands in
America ltas been headquartered at
SUNYA. Moellcken is itt the pro-
cess of writing a book on the sub-
ject. i'l

Doug Manley. Free/c staff
member. explained that the catn-
palgn did not depend on trusting
the Soviet Union. "We would ttot
and will not halt nuclear production
until they do." he asserted. "Disar-
tttatnent must be done In a unifiable
manner. with botlt sides agreeing to
the same titles." Beetle agreed, ad-
ding that although the goals are dif-
ficnll. they are not impossible to
achieve. “First it is necessary to cttt
back. Then we will demand the
discontinuation of nuclear weapons
altogether. it is our eventual aim to
rid the world of nuclear weapons
altogether." she said.

many other freeze activists see is
that "not enough Americans are
aware of tile difference between the
conventional weapon attd nuclear
weapons." Site added that while
conventional weapons (guns. hand
grenades) are of course dangerous.
nuclear weapons are far tnore
devastating. “People do ttot realize
or just do not choose to know the
seriousness of the tnatter itself."
Site added, citing the historical
disaster of the nuclear attacks on
the Japanese cities of Hiroshima
and Nagasiki over 30 years ago, that
“people tend to forget what hap-
pened to the citizens there. They do
not take into consideration the

long-term. detrimental effects
which the bomb had on those peo-
plc, the people that didn't die were
hopelessly deformed for life." Bee-
tle noted that people today tend to
forget that with the weapons we
have today. the potential ofdisaster
in the United States is much worse
than ever before.

"it is a frightening but realistic
fact to contend with." she stressed.
Beetle continued. stating that
“together. the United States and
the Soviet Union have a million-
and-a-half times the explosive
power of the Hiroshima bomb.
More Americans rnttst concern
themselves with saving the world
from potential destruction. This is
the issue at hand."

At this time. there is an estimated
50.000 ttttclear weapons iii the
United States alone. Beetle said.
This number could rise by I7.000 in
he next I5 years. she added. Either
side who tries to get art advantage
just scents to trigger more produc-
tion. Beetle explained, noting that it
is a fact which nuclear freeze ac-
tivists fear with grave intensity.
"It‘s a no win. never ending situa-
tion.“ llcctlc explained. "This is
why we want citizens to repudiate
the weapons for the elimination of
titem altogether. People must turn
away from nuclear weapons and
tight for their right to exist safely in
the world. This is what the walk
itself represents to the
participants."

Bectlc and other campaign
members fuin endorse any type of
involvement by any person in-
icrcstcd in the freeze involvement.
“The walk was just one step." Bec-
tle claimed. “We will not stop until
we have achieved our goals." {3
