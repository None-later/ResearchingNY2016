6 ALBANY STUDENT PRESS ‘El OCTOBER 4. I983

Historian stresses importance of tri

 

By Robert Longoboceo

For many, the celebration of Albany
County’s tricentennial is either a reason to be
dazzled by ﬁreworks or to be annoyed by
tricentennial minutes on television; but,
historian C.R. Roseberry believes that it
should mean a great deal more to Albany
residents. “The tricentennial has real
signiﬁcance. it is a reminder to the people at
the date of the county‘s finding and the im-
portance ofAlbany County. Also, the county
has never celebrated a centennial before,"
said Roseberry.

Roseberry spoke before 36 people at the
Recital Hall in the Performing Arts Center
on Sunday afternoon. He was commissioned
by the county to writcA/bany. A County/or
300 Years, as part of the activities connected
with the tricentennial.

His lecture centered on events itt New York
State and England 300 years ago. “The Euro—
peatt background is very important. liccaus‘t
ofspace lintitatiotts, my background research
on England could not fit iii the book. i
believe a big frame of reference is missing
front the book. i did extra work and research
for the lectttre tltat i didn't do for the book
so it (the lecture) had added significance,"
stressed Roseberry.

 

On the American side of tire ocean, New
York governor Thomas Dognan oversaw the
important events, explained Roseberry.
Under his leadership, “The Charter of
Priviledges" was forttted in I683, he noted.
Besides having a liberal religious tolerance
clause, the charter was the first tinte in
history that the word “peOple” was mention-
ed in a government document as a recipient
of a fair government, according tc
Roseberry. He noted that “The convention
that convened to write the charter was the
first instance of freely elected representative
delegates gathering to make laws which affect
them." The charter created the eleven
original counties of New York who all share
their tricentennial this year, he said. At its in-

ception. Albany County was larger than the
other ten. combined. and it occupied much
of what is now Vermont. Roscberry added.

Roseberry said that since that historical
document, Albany has had a rich and enter-
taining history. in the American revolution,
few places can claim as important a role as
Albany County. “The Revolutionary War is
my favorite aspect of all of Albany history. it
was a dramatic and far reaching event.
Albany was so central to the climax of the
war in the north. Everything revolved around

 

 

 

mcnt had finally settled in Albany. But one
detail was left unfinished," he said. “in
I971, an assemblyman discovered that
Albany was never pfl‘tclally named the
capital, so a bill to that effect was put
through. The establishment of the capital
was the biggest event changing Albany from
a Dutch community to an important city in
the state," ltc stated.

Roseberry noted that the institution that
Albany ltas contributed to the nation is the

stated Roseberry.

The Revolutionary War in Albany was an

but, Roseberry noted. the establishment of
Albany as the capital of New York was the
most important development in County
history. and took over l50 years to happen.
“When New York State was first created. the
legislature met as it traveled between New
York and Albany. Eventually tltcy couldn't
carry all the documents. so in 1797 they voted
to store the documents in Albany." explain-

to the early nineteenth century. “Martin Van
Burcn organized Albany's first machine
before he became Andrew Jackson's Vice-
Presidcnt. Then Tlturlow Tweed came to
town and started the Albany Journal and the
Whig party," he explained. “The final
transformation of the machine began in the
l8905 with the Republican macltine of
Barnes. One of his henchmen, Daniel P.
O'Connell. became the Democratic leader
but used the tricks and tactics of the
Republicans to start the machine that (late

By Steve Marks
and Dee Prentiss

 

Ed and Lisa have been going out for two
years. Saturday night they went to the Rat,
. and spent the evening with friends. A guy
who lives in Lisa's dorm sat down with her to
talk for a while. They laughed together about
something that happened in the dorm, and
while they spoke Ed gulpcd down a few
beers. Lisa's friend left and Ed and Lisa hung
.out with their friends tt ' '
while longer before going 
home. On the way back to 
Roots

Ed became
hostile. He accused Disa of
“coming on" to another man. Lisa calmly
tried to reassure him that she was just being
friendly. She realized Ed was drunk and that
there I was no point in arguing with him.
However, by the time they reached the
dorms. Ed's anger had intensified and he
called Lisa a “lying cheat." When she started
’0 walk out of the rootn Ed grabbed lter and
shoved her backward, knocking her into a
desk and sendittg ltcr to the floor. Lisa got up
and ran out oftltc room.

The next day Ed went to Lisa's room bear-

what he had done and he promised Lisa it
would never happen again. Ed spent the next
few weeks being exceptionally kind and con-
siderate. Their relationship seemed to be

~stronger titan ever...

Three months later Ed sloped Lisa for smil-
ing at a guy at a party.

The ﬁctional case study cited above is just
one example of a pattern found to becom-
mon in most incidents of relationship
violence according to Mary Beth Collier.
Outreach Coordinator at Middle Earth
Counseling Center.

Theresa Zubretsky. a counselor at Families
a Crisis outlines three phases which
characterize such relationships; “Tlte first
phase is a Tension Building phase in which
the frustration of the batterer manifests
itself. The second phase is the acute battering
incident in which the actual physical and ver-
bal abuse occur.” According to Zubretsky.
“Relationship violence is ttot litnited to
physical abuse. The third attd final phase is
the Honeymoon period which serves to
strengthen the ‘emotional ties between the

two. it is often a renewal of the feeling that

The battering person generally apoliglzes and
promises the battered that it will not occur
again."

Battering within boyfriend-girlfriend rela-
tionships on college campuses is on the rise.
Libby Post. mcdla director of the Stttdcnt
Association and coordinator of Women's
Safety Awareness Days, said that people
often assume that relationship violence does
not go on at a University campus.Post stress-
ed. however. that this campus is a microcosm
of the rest of the world; what goes on out
there goes on here. “Men don’t wait until
they’re married to batter women." she said.

Residencial Life, aware of the problems
women faceon campus. is attempting to help
women who face abuse problems. They said
information is difﬁcult to obtain. however.
because incidents of physical abuse tend to be
hushed up. Assistant Director of Residence
Life John Mttrphy indicates that roommates,
suitemates and close friends are reluctant to
report it or to intervene. “Tltey tend to be
embarasscd attd to ltave an ‘1‘” tttittd my own
business‘ attitude."

'iBattering relationships rising on campuses

Alcohol plays a key role in physical abuse
on campus. According to Zubrctsky, 78 per-
cent of reported fights and assaults in the
dorms involve alcohol, and in 80 percent of
all incidents of relationship violence, alcohol
is a factor.

Hank Yost. a mental health professional
volunteer for the Men's Coalition Against
Batterlng. said that the violence also occurs
when the couple is thrown together for a
number of hours. when studying, for exam-
ple, or on weekends. The violence often oc-
curs only in private and tends not to occur in
a public atmosphere. Yost gous on to say
abusive relationships characterize ttinc per-
cent of all relationships.

“Batterers are not mentally unstable or
crazy," explained Yost. “ﬂattering is a learn-
ed style of coping, usually observed since
childhood." A battercr's family history
follows a pattern of domestic violence, so ltc
ltas learned no other effective method of
dealing with his emotions. said Yost.
Violence becomes an outlet for his emotions,
lte ttoted. it is also an effective way for the
battercr to maintain control, Yost added. if
