Many of SUNYA's il,000-pius
undergraduates do not ﬁt into the typical
mold of an i8-22-year-old straight out of
high school. There are hundreds of male and
female undergraduates each year over
twenty-live years old who take credited
courses at SUNYA. They can be classified as
a unique group at this university that over the
years has been increasing.

The number of returning students has been
increasing steadily. relative to the total
undergraduate population over the last seven
years. from 867 (8.5 percent) in 1976 to “06
(9.7 percent) in 198]. “The percentage of
women to men has grown even more
signiﬁcantly over this same period from a
fifty-ﬁfty split to 59 percent-4i percent in
favor of women." according to Director of
the Ofﬁce for institutional Research Patrick
Tcrcnzini. '

These students have many things in com-
mon besides their older age. The reasons
nrost often mentioned for returning to school
years after first attending include: switching
to a more fulﬁlling field. dissatisfaction with
being a housewife. arid rctraittittg. A transfer
student from Schenectady Community Col-
lege said that site “as tired of her jobs.

“Going back to college ltas helped tttc
dL‘\L‘iUp a trtore positite self-image" Return-
irtg sttident Linda Ayres said. “i was sear~
citing for a more challenging job than key
pttrtclt operator. i attt aitttirtg for an English
degree. which will allow rtre to work with
people more."

Coming back to scltool can he an attsious
time for many. said Suzanne i’ecorc.
Chairperson of Returning Women Students.
“There is a lot of fear that adults don't ex-
pect to have. You feel old being around
younger students. Tltc older we are. the tttore
we are related negatively by students to their
parents. i felt that way when i was their age.
but it‘s hard to deal with once you‘re on the
receiving end."

"One of the most frequently mentioned
problems of returning students, especially
women. is time management." says Karieen
Karison, former returning student and co-
advisor to the Returning Women’s group.
"Besides school work. women are also
responsible for a home, spouse. part-time Job
and children.

"There is a displacement problem." she
noted. with many returning women who
“have never had to support themselves. and
now suddenly find themselves feeding
children. holding down a job and taking
courses.”

Another problem she explained is “learn-
ing how to study again. since most returning
students have been out of an educational en-
vironment for ﬁve to is years, and are com-
peting against younger undergraduates who
are fresh out of high school and geared
towards learning." Much of this unfamiliari-
ty leads to a more severe case of the typical
undergraduate's test anxiety. she said.

Returning Women Students is the one
group that ltas been formed to promote in-
tercsts and give support to returning

students. including men. This student

site said. However. site added. “this is the
one special interest group on campus where
returning students cart discuss problems artd
get advice frotn their peer group."

The group is taking suggestions for a new
name and “iii officially represent all return-
irtg students when it submits its new constitu-
tion to SA for approval this month.

Although tirey constitute about 40 percent
of returning students. “there is only a token
representation of men in Returning Women
Students. though both sexes are welcome,"
said Chairperson Pecore. “it seems that men

said Karlson.

Returning student Brian lieleskc spoke
about tttany of the same problems arid
motivations that women encounter such as
“the difficulty of meeting people off-campus
and the need for a more satisfying job." iic
said that he nonetheless “enjoys the cuitttrai
events and the exchange of ideas between
people with similar goals."

Despite the numerous obstacles faced by
returtting students. an overwhelming majori-

While students and faculty
sweated it ottt tltis summer in
Albany. two scientists frortt the
State University of New York at
Albany were contending with the
January-like wcatltcr irt a remote
part of the Arctic Circle.

to Schenectady, New York.

“We left on a 90 degree July
day." Samson said “and arrived to
below freezing temperatures in the
Arctic. The plane landed right on
the Arctic Circle. They don't itave a
runway so they packed the snow to
make a ‘skiway'. she explained.

“in the Arctic Circle summer is
at the saute time as ottr surrrrtter
here. but in tire daytirrrc the
temperature only reaches 10

degrees." Samson said. "The sun
was up for all but an hour. l
r L the temperature broke
freezing once."

Samson and Barnard, both
vcterart polar expeditioners. spent
at least 10 to 12 hours outside col-
lectirtg air ttnd snow samples.

Tltc researchers ltopc that their
analysis of sarttplcs from
Greeniand's 8.500-foot thick ice
cap will lreip tltertt answer questions
about pollution of the earth's at-
mosphere. Samson added that
"Arctic air is the cleanest air on the
world."

“Deep ice cores store at least
2.000 years of irtformation waiting
to be analyzed." Samson said.

Some of tile obstacles that came
along with the territory included
sunburn, frostbite rtrtd isolation.

"it was easy to get sunburncd
with the sun reﬂecting off the area.
everywhere you looked it was
white," Samson said.

“Temperatures were below freez-

couldn't manipulate things with
gloves on. Frostbite was always a
factor," said Barnard.

Barnard spent nine consecutive
months in the Arctic studying the

doing my work, though at times i

since national policy is not govern-

"As far as i know." lte said.
"any stttdettt can take arty academic

military commission are ottt of

sttclt as the rernovai of flyct's and
posters regarding gay and lesbian
evcnts arid seminars demonstrate
the discriminatory feelings of some
SUNYA students. they said.

The library can also be cited as art
example. GALA membch add. in
that the periodiettl "Journal of
Homosexuality" is trot to be found
itt the stacks with the other
periodicals. but under lock and key.
The explanation given for this.
iiagle said. is that if it is left on tlte

stacks it gets either removed or
destroyed. He said that this compels
the prospective user to risk for it,
‘which can prove to' be inhibitory.
