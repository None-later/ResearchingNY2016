he feels his control in the relation-
ship is slipping. violence helps him
gain that control back. he con-
tinued. This violence does not occur
without guilt. however. the batterer
often feels quite badly about
himself and what he has done. he
explained.

Zubrctsky explained that the bat-
tering victim. usually the woman.
can sometimes feel helpless. unable
to alter the pattcrn of violence in
the relationship. Told repeatedly
she Is no good. that she does
everything wrong, Zubrctsky cx-
tplalned that the victim begins to
believe that it Is hertault she is
beaten. She takes responsibility for
her loved one's violent behavior
although unrelated to what she has
or has not done. Zubretsky added
that the emotional damage inflicted
by a battering can be more painful
than the physical beating itself.
Also. she said. psychological
wounds take longer to heal that
physical ones.

isolation of the victim is extreme-
ly common. She denies that there is
anything wrong in the relationship.
and is forced to cut herself off from
othch because of her mate's
unreasonable jealousy. According
to Zubrctsky. the woman needs to
develop a support system through

friends. counseling, or recreation.
and needs to learn to direct her own
anger appropriately.

Relationship abuse is indeed oc-
curring on this campus. There are
many places for people to turtt who
ﬁnd themselves in this situation.
Mcn's Coalition Against Battering
offch services to the batterch who
are trying to change. It is a

mental health professionals. it

I designed to “Help him learn otltcr
ways of coping. and to give him a
larger coping repertoire." said
Yost. They can be contacted at

A second place to turn for help is
“‘Familics in Crisis." a branch of

(CPS) If the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson
decides to run for president next
year. there may be no better place
to announce It than any one of the
nation's il4 historically black col-
legcs.

At the nation's largest black cam-
pus. the University ofthc District of
Columbia. for example. “I can
guarantee you that 90 to 99 percent
of the students would vote for
him." promises Warren Grccn.
president of UDC'S sludcnt govern-
mcnt.

A I5,000 UDC block vote would
be no small potatoes. especially in
view of how a switch of a nrcrc 150
votes In each voting district would
have reversed the Reagan lundslidc
of I980.

But of even more signiﬁcance Is
the extraordinary enthusiasm for a
black presidential candidacy on
many campuses. witcrc apathy and
student unwillingness to vote
ultimately wrecked the ambitious
college registration drives of
Eugene McCarthy. Bobby Kennedy
rind George McGovern in years
past. Nowhere. moreover. has stu-
dent purticlptttion in presidential
politics been thinner than on black
campuses.

But things have changed. Just
last wcck for instance. at Soutltcrn
University in Baton Rouge. student
Vice President Myron Hubbard lcd
rtn effort that iitcludcd rui lsicy
Brothch concert. shuttle buses and
candleliqu parades. In the cod. it
helped register some 5000 studcrtts
to vote. well over half tltc universi-
ty's student body.

At Xatvicr University in Ncw
()rlcuns. thc wcck iticlrtdcd voter

took three busloads — 200 students
—— to be registered. When he spoke
at Jackson State. he took two
busloads down."

“There's power in knowing we
elected a black mayor just
recently." Soutltcrn's Hubbard cx-
plains. "It's happening all over.
and it’s exciting."

At Tuskegee Institute in
Alabama. organizers last week ltcld
voter registration activities with its
traditional Murdi Grits fcsllvul.
which incltrdcd llrc litnc-ltonorcd
pep rally. masquerade ball and
fashion show. “We figure we‘ll get
people to sign up wltilc cvcrybody‘s
rclaxcd and having fun." rcttsons
studcnt President Reginald lilounl.

To build a ﬁre under tltcm.
Blount also brought in Dr. Arthur
Thomas of Central Stalc in Wilber-
force. Ohio. to speak about "Why
a Black Should Run For
President." Thomas is also a
member of Rev. Jackson's support
committee.

,5—

But much of last week's fervor
and the events planned for coming
monthcs are for the idea of a black
candidacy. regardless of who the
cvctual candidate might be.
Students also mentioned Georgia
state Sen. Julian Bond. Atlanta
Mayor Andrew Young and
Washington. D.C. House Delegate
Walter Fttunlroy as candidates.

“Voter registration is the only
tiring Jcssc Jackson is trying to pro-
mote." Hubbard contends. “Rcv.
Jackson is fully aware there are
olltcr blacks morc corrtpctcttt and
qtuilificd for u prcsidcniial race."

lint it is clearly Jackson who is
lciidirtg tltc phcnomcnon. which
pcrhups can bc bcst compared to
last spring‘s Chicago mayoral cam-
paign. in which a candidate — thcn-
Congressman Harold Washington
—— was picked by a grass roots black
political movement that began as a
voter registration drive lied to no
one politician. Last month. sup-
porters dld form a Jesse Jackson

and I25 black clergyman recently
organized a Draft Jackson commit-

lice.

' And while Jackson himsclI‘is cur-
rrently in Europe registering U.S.
servicemen ihcrc. PUSH — Pcoplc
United to Serve Humanity. the
educational and motivational group
Jackson founded and still hcads —
is planning an "extensive" college

The 100 cumpus totir. says PUSH
spokcsnuut Frank Watkins from
PUSH's Chicago hcudqunrlcrs. will
try to rcgistcr it "rainbow" of
black. hispunic. and white students.

Jackson. who has coyly turned
away questions about his can—
didacy. is botind to Icavc students
hanging during his tour. Xavier's
Shelton recalls Jackson at the na-
tional PUSH cunvcnlion several

months ago “saying everything a
cadidatc would say. We were all on
,Iltc edge of otir seats. The crowd
:was chanting ‘Ruu. Jesse. Run.’ Hz:

say it." Shelton chuckles.

f'A lot of students here (at
Southern) feel very good about a
possible Jackson bid." adds student
President Cleo Fields. “They are
deﬁnitely ready for it."

Agrees Shelton. "Thctimc is now
for a black president. They said the

_timc wasn't right for Frederick

Douglass in the late i80()s. They're
still saying now is not the time. But
if not now. when? And if not Jesse.

,who?"

Sltclton bclicvcs Jackson’s appeal
is broad. "He‘s talking in terms of
oppressed people. who are more
than just blocks. That includes
women. people of color and poor
white men. That could create quite
a coalition."

"No question about it." observes

.UDC‘s Green. “black folks will

vote for blacks. We've been op-
pressed for so long. To have that
hope — ﬁnally. a black president ~—
it's very powerful." Ci
