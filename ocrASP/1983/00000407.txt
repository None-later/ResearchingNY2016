Computer and business courses are impor-
tant, but experience. research. and an in-
teresting resume are also key factors in tin-
ding a job, according to John Alexander,
Director of SUNYA's Career Planning and
Placement Ofﬁce.

Alexander emphasized these points during
a lecture he gave Tuesday entitled “Your
Resume: is it Enough? Learn to Market
Yourself." Alexander added that a good
resume isn't enough. but it is very important.
He explained that many employers don’t
have time to read eaclt resume thoroughly
and will pay more attention to an interesting
one than a boring one. “A good resume is
like a good news story." He states “it catches
your attention and then moves you along.“
Alexander suggested that students display

Another important factor in ﬁnding a job
is contacts that students develop while they
are still in school. noted Bob Rogers. a part-
ner in the Albany employment counseling
agency. Sage Associates, and co-author of a
book entitled Secrets of Ihe'Hidden Job
Mar/rel.

These contacts will be very useful. because.
Rogers claims, only is percent of jobs are
ﬁlled through conventional means such as
employment agencies and responses to help-
wanted ads. Alexander advises students to
look to family and friends for help on break-
ing into a career.

Rogers. a SUNYA alunmus suggests that
"students establish a network while they are
undergraduates." Through this network
students can develop contacts which cart be

Speaker says resume is not enough to get jobs

utilized after graduation. "Networking"
means “talking to people and collecting
names" of people involved in a student‘s
potential career.

Students should also attempt to get involv-
ed in voluntary or paid activities which relate
to their career. Rogers added. He believes
that university life is a time for “risk-taking
and testing-out ideas. i feel by the time a per-
son graduates he should have a good idea of
himself." Rogers said.

However, before students attempt to gain
experience in a career. Alexander maintain-
ed. they must first ascertain whether or not a
pttrticular career suits them.

Alexander suggested that the research
phase be carried out by locating material in
the University Library and the Office of
Career Planning and Placement.

This department. he noted. maintains a

tions.

An important aspect of both resume
preparation and workplace activity is com-
munication. "People who can't com-
municate can‘t function in our society. if a
person with poor communication skills
manages to obtain a job. he will eventually
fail because he can't talk or write
effectively," Rogers expalined.

Rogers also claims that “the generalist is
now sought after more often than in the past.
Companies need people with diverse in-
terests." He encourages students to major in
the social sciences. humanities and fine arts.
but reminds them to "always consider the
job market” and take practical courses in

,hook keeping and computers.
