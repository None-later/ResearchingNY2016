Dane harrier Ed McGill: The leader of thepack I

By Tom Kacandes
ASMX'IA TE SPORTS EDITOR

____.___._—

Albany junior Ed McGill travell-
ed a very long road before he came
here to SUNYA. where he now or:-
cupies the number one spot on the
up-nnd-coming men’s cross-country
team.

The Danes lost four of last year's
top scvcn runners to graduation.
leaving a big gap up front that need-
cd to be filled if this year's team was
to have a shot at a good season.
Several returning runners improved
considerably. but the team still
needed a big gun up front to be
competitive.

Enter Ed McGill. After bouncing
around from school to school as a
scholarship runner. McGill finally
dropped ottt of school altogether.
disgusted with the cxpcricncc. He
then worked a nurober of different
jobs. and drifted around the East
Coast before settling iii the Albany
area.

McGill spent last season in poor
condition and ineligible, but after
becoming formally matriculated
last January. he competed on the
men's indoor and outdoor track
learns and worked himself into
competitive shape by sprlng's end.
After a summer of running IOU-mile
weeks. McGill entered the season in
great shape and immediately assum-
ed the number one position on the
team.

Born in Boston. McGill says that
he began running at age ten.
"because my father forced me to."
Apparently, the bug bit because
he's been running ever since then.
As a high school freshman, McGill
displayed some talent. recording a
best time of “:40 over two miles.
“I was into it mentally. but I never

really trained that much." be ex-
plained.

in any case. McGill improved
steadily through high school. lower-
ing his two-mile time to i0:40 as a
sophomore. then 9:50 as a junior.
and finally recording a high school
best time of 9:30. He was recruited
by SCVL‘ttlI smalle: private colleges.
but ended up at Bridgcwatcr State
because of financial considerations.

McGill was dissatisfied with the
school‘s “rotten academics." and
1nd difficulties during his first
cross-country season. "lltlll tltc
team fltrnkcd out before the moon
was over. so l‘d figured that there
wasn‘t much future in their pro~
grant." ltc explained.

McGill then returned home and
took classes titrough the continuing
education program at the Universi-
ty of Massachusetts. "I was still of
hanging in limbo and as far as tttllll-
ing went 1 was just jogging around
aimlessly." he said.

So far McGill has met everyone
clsc‘s expectations. having con-
sislenlly finished in the top tltrcc in
almost every race so for. "This
team is very close: it's a fumin nt-
rnospherc and the support really
helps me alon'.” ltc said. “Now
that l'm going to school and things
are back on track in general. I’m
just trying to see how far I can go."
McGill noted that the SUNYACs
(Oct. 15) are coming at a good time
for him because “I feel very strong
now andtthings have been going
better and better, so it should be
good."

McGill will travel with the men's
cross-country team to Van Cor-
tlundt Park in the Bronx tomorrow
as the Danes lake on Queens. 'l‘rcn-
ton. and Montclnir State Colleges.

(letting outside was one thing the
Danes. failed to do last week. The
Danes' rushing attack gained
negative one yards at halftime.
while closing the game with only 44.

As usual. the Danes will have to
depend upon their defense on
Saturday to stay in the game.

“If we play the type of defense
we did last week. we shouldn't have
too much of a problem containing
them." said Ford.

Southern Conncctlcut uses a wing

fallback David Schmidt for the in-
side garlic. while using spccdy
tailback Kerry Taylor to go outside.

"They have a well balanced type
of offense similar to the one we saw
in Union." said Ford. “Their ratio
of running to passing is about
