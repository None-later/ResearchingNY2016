Nigerian students in debt

Washington, D. C.
(CPS) As many as half the 20.000 Nigerians
studying in the United States may now be
suffering "financial hardship" — scrambling
to pay tuition. room and board. and other
debts — according to a new study by the Na-
tional Assoelation of Foreign Student Ad-
visors (NAFSA).

Based on a survey of 50 colleges. NAFSA
Executive Vice President John F. Reichard
estimates “as many as 10.000 to l2.000
students nationally" could be significantly in
debt.

In AuguSI. NAFSA advised American col-
leges to try to solve the escalating problem of
Nigerian student debt by not allowing
Nigerians on certain government scholarships

. to enroll this term unless they pay in advance.

Some help may be on the way from their
homeland. Nigerian Embassy spokemen here
say. but the Nigerian government reportedly
is sending American colleges less titan a
quarter of the money owed.

The Nigerian debt to American campuses
has been growing for two years. in l9iil. the
Nigerian government temporarily stopped
payment to students on certaitt types of
Nigerian state scholarships because of the na-
tion's cconontic troubles.

Much of Nigeria's export income has dried
up since the world oil supply outgrew de-
mand. Nigeria has been a major oil exporter.

In light of the crisis. many American
schools extended credit and delayed tuition
charges to their Nigerian students in hopes
they would pay their debts as their country‘s
economy improved.

Payments. however. ltavc not been for
thcomlng. The Nigerian debt to American
campuses may now be close to Slo million.
says NAFSA spokeswoman Georgia Stewart.

"There are some colleges where the debt is
going into two and three terms." she says.
“it is our hope that the Nigerian government

will come to the aid of the institutions where
large debts have accrued."

"(The languishing debts) are a chronic
problem for Nigerian students. and a lesser
problem for students from Mexico and
Venezuela." she explains. Mexico and
Veneluela. of course. are also dependent on
oil exports for economic health.

"Our recommendations are to protect the
students as well as the institutions."

Foreign students admitted to the US. must
continue to be enrolled in school in order to
maintain their visiting student status. CX<
plains Verne Jervis with the U.S. im-
migraiton and Naturallzaiton Service (lNS).

Since a number of schools now require
Nigerian students to pay tuition in advance.
“it's possible there are some who are out of
school and waiting for money to come in to
re-enroll." Stewart says.

Altltottgh those students would he
violating their visa requirements. "they can
come to the ms and ask permission to work
and pay their tuition costs under special cir-
cumstances. or a district director might give
them a 30- or 60-day grace period to get back
in school.” Jervis says.

“We're not in the habit of going out and
looking for students (to deport)." he adds.

Financial help may be on the way.

"Our government is still limiting the
amount of money coming out of Nigeria."
says Joseph Obodezc. press officer for the
Nigerian Embassy. "But we are sending $2
million in relief funds for federal scholars
and students on state-sponsored scholar-
ships."

The money. however. is for all Nigerian
students worldwide. not just for those in the
US. '

Nigerian students' money woes promise to
continue for a while. The debt problems.
Obodeze says. won't end until "the Nigerian
economy picks up again." ['l

Capt’n Crunchlday planned

South BendJn
(CPS) What started as an absurdisl catnpaign
promise during last spring‘s class election:
has materialized ittto a week-long “Capt'n
Crunch" extravaganza at the University of
Notre Dame. where students will gorge
themselves on cereal. go on treasure hunts.
and dress up in costume for the mid-October
event.

“it all started out as a waon get attention
during the student elections last spring.“ ex«
plains Lee Broussard. sophomore class presi-
dent.

"As part of my platform. 1 promised the
sophomore class a Capt‘n Crunch party." he
continues. "But when I got elected. l began
thinking about how much it would cost to
feed Capt‘n Crunch to 1700 people." ‘

So Broussard wrote a letter to Quaker Oats
— makers of Capt'n Crunch — asking them
to dortatc the cereal as a public relations
gesture. _

“They got back in touch with me and
thought it was a good idea. attd wattted to
make it ittto a wltolc week of events that they
would sponsor." itc says.

indeed, Quaker is spending over 560.000
on the Oct. l7-2l event. which will include
such prizes as 10 expenses-paid trips to-
Florida. video cassette recorders. tickets to

football and basketball games. and t-sltirts.

“We'll have 300 tcattts of five people each
in the Capt‘n Crttnelt eating contest."
Broussard says. ‘

I'l think it's great." says Brian Lallaghan.
student government president. “People are
talking about it all over. just wondering what
kinds of things are going to happen."

Callaghan says Notre Dame is no stranger
to “mindless” events such as the Capt'u
Crunch activities.

"We ltave mud figltts every spring where
something like 700 people just go ottt and
wallow in the ntud for an afternoon. and we
sponsor an annual event called ‘Rcccss‘
witcrc we itave tricycle races and finger pain-
ting contests." he says.

Not all off-tltc-wall campaigns involving

.name brand products work at all schools.

ltowcvcr.

A University of Tennessee engineering
sophomore has dedicated himself to couvinc~
ing the M and M Mars Candy Company to
bring back red M and Ms. which it discon-
tinued using itt 1976 because of a study link-
ing red dye No. 2 to cancer.

But his campaign so far has been unsuc—
cessful.

“Ever since we stopped making the led M
and Ms. we've been researching and checking
other dyes we could use." says .lint Cundiff.
spokcstnan for Mars candy.

“But we just haven’t found arty that meet
our standards. and despite the student‘s
claims that the red ones taste better (all colors
taste the same). we have no plans to rein-
troduce tltctn." lZl
