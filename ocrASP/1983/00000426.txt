ROTC prof. tries to

MARQUETTE, MI
(CPS) A Northern Michigan
University military science instruc-
tor has been fired front his teaching
post for biting the head off a live
chicken during class and tlten drink-
ing the blood of the slaughtered
fowl. all in an effort "to get
students' attention."

The incident occurred Sept. l as
Sgt. Maj. Jimmy A. Powell was Ice-
turing his leadership training class
for new ROTC (Reserve Officers
Training Command) recruits.

"Apparently (Powell) had the
whole thing planned out in advance
as a way to get students' attention
during their first day of class." says
Col. Donald Taylor, head of the
military science department..

After Introducing himself and
lecturing students for several

mintttcs. PoWell left the room and
cttme back carrying a live chicken.

"According to the students, he
was just walking around with the
chicken. explaining things like what
happens if you attend class out of~
umtorm, when all of a sudden he
extended the neck of the chicken an
hit it off." Tayloy says.

Then. as horrified slttdents look-
ed on, l‘ou'cil held the chicken up
over his head and let llle blood run
into his mouth.

“I was shocked and disgusted
when I heard about it later that
afternoon," Taylor says. "i check-
cd all lltc facts and determined tltcre
was absolutely no justification for
what had been done. and that it
simply could not be tolerated."

The following morning Taylor
met with university officials and

decided to relieve Powell of his
teaching pest and reassign him to
nearby K.i. Sawyer Airforcc Base.

“Nobody had any knowledge this
thing was going to happen," Taylor
explains. “(Powcil) had taught a
number of classes like Land
Navigation and Marksmanship for
over a year. and we‘d never had any
trouble with him bcfore."

Other faculty members have ex-
pressed "shock and revulsion" at
what happened. says Faculty Senate
Chairman Roger iiarry. an NMU
chemistry professor.

“He still doesn’t understand why
I and the other university officials
have reacted so strongly to what he
did." Taylor says. "He still feels it
was an acceptable technique to get
students' attention." l I
