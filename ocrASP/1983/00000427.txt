Danes’ win over Owls helps boost con

By Marc Schwarz
SPORTS EDITOR

__’_.____.————
The Albany Slate-Grcat Danes
won more than just a game last
Saturday afternoon in New Havcn.
They gained confidence in
themselves as a team and in their
ability to win football games.

“it makes us all think we can do
it now," senior linebacker Ed
Eastman said of the 22-12 upset of
the Division li Southern Conncc-
ticut Owls.

“1'” tell you, it will do a lot for
everyone. it's good to win,“ cor-
ncrback Bobby Jojo commented.

The Dancs cntcrcd the game wiili
a l-3 rccord arid wcrc coming off a
24-7 thrashing at tile builds of
Union Collcgc last week. 'i'lic tcuIn
had bccn Ilﬂht‘i by injuries and

"i lioiicslly try to In: optimistic

ing we would show ticincndom
growth in the garlic,“ Albany IlCiitl
COllCll lioh Ford said. “the critical
thing was wc got licllcr Iodny. Not

only did we get better. but we won
today.“

Prior to the game against the
Owls, the Danes were unable to
muster any offensive ﬁrepower this
season. Besides tiic 28 points
Albany scored against the inept
Brockporl Eagles, the offense had
only bccn able to put l0 points on
the scoreboard in three oiiicr
games. A "green" Offensive line. as
Ford liked to term it. a change in
quartcrbacks and nine new starters
on offense combined to turn the
usually potent Danc wishbone at-
tack into an ancrnic onc_.

Against the Owls, Albany did
Something with lhc opening kick-
off tlicy had not done all scason:
lhcy drove down ficld. Dcspilc an
intcrccpiion that killed lhc cighi
play. 64-yard opening drive. the
Danes were finally able to move the
hall.

“That drivc gavc us confidence in
the offense. They showed they
could more lhc bull." Jojo said.

"it just puriipcd the team up."
Quarterback Mikc Miiano added.

ifidcncc in themselves.

That conﬁdence manifested itself
in a 75-yard pass play from wide
receiver ilob ilricri to halfback John
Donncliy for a Iouciidown five
minutes into tiic sccond quarter.

"it's a big boost knowing now
that the offcnsc can score."
Eastman said. “in the beginning of
the year things just didn‘t click."

The Danes wcrc able to put the
hull across the goal line twicc more
in pulling iogcliicr their finest per-
formancc of the year.

‘ “This game shows we have lhc
makings of a good football lcrun.
We had not played it good game

ﬁdence

collectively this year," Ford com-
mented. “You win with consistent
performances from your offense
and dcfcnsc. We also got some
great performances from some in-
,dividuals."
’ As the Danes look forward to the
[rest of the season. they will now
enter lhcir rcniriining games with
confidence. The offense feels it can
move the ball and score.The
dcfcnsc now bclicvcs lhcy can rely
on the offense to give them a lead
which llicy will protect.

As Jojo said. "I iliink that win
helped us a lot. it sure didn't
hurt." i l
