“The people on line other side wan! to help us. "

 

By Meyrl Reichbach

Toni Tisinger chose a student
from the more than 60 people atten-
ding “The Realms of Psychic
Perception,“ and asked the student
to speak loudly. The audience was
silent when she said that “you have
some things on your mind.
something about a class." She add-
ed. “These things will settle soon."
The student had Just experienced a
"reading" by clairvoyant and
member of the Foundation for
Spiritual Evolution. Toni Tisingcr.

This was one of several
demonstrations presented to the au-
dience on Wednesday night in the
Alumni House.

Judy Reill, also a member and
clairvoyant, chose a man from the
audience and expressed. “It sisterly
presence was with him." Reill udd-
ed. "Your first wife died of a chest
disease." The man confirmed this
but later added. “Reill was correct
about my wife but wrong about

everything else."

When asked if his parents were
angry with the way he spends his
money one young man said, “She
was right. my parents are upset
about my spending money."

“The Realms of Psychic Percep-
tion" consisted of several
demonstrations and a lecture by
Foundation leader. Joe Guice.
Guice. a medium, gave a brief in-
troduction into the world of
"psychic phenomenon." He has
been involved in psychic studies for
nine years and has also taught the
topic for the past five years.

Guice stressed that "by learning
to tune into energy that exists in all
of us we can all gain some control
over it."

According to Guice, physics sup-
ports the theory of “psychic
phenomenon.” He added. “Since
we are all made up of energy. there
is no reason why we can‘t tap into
the energy of others."

"We are living in a closed

Psychic demonstrates phenomena at session

system." said Guice. “No energy is
lost or gained." This supports the
concept that there is no death,
merely a passing nn, he explained.

The other reality is “an existence we
cannotpercei‘ve any more than we
are aware of TV or radio waves that
sass through this goom," he said.

When questioned ’itbout mediums,
he explained that. “every person
has a guide on the other side who
cares for them."

in an informal discussion after
the lecture. Tisingcr explained that.
"the people on the other side want
lti help us" and through hard work
and meditation exercises she can
receive this help.

If anyone is interested in pursu-
ing the study of psychic awareness
they can contact the Foundation for
Spiritual Evolution which is located
in Guilderland. Courses in healing.

sciousness will beoffcred. i.l
