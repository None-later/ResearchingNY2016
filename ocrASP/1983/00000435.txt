Heaven Can Wait

.. RIDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1983

 

Closing The Deal

0 you want to go to heaven?”
i looked up in surprise. closing
the book l'd been reading. The
small, bespectacled man In front of me
waited humbly as I studied him. He was
wearing what must have been a $250
business sult(herring-bone), and carrying a
leather brief- case. His round, smiling face
was highlighted by a pair of patient blue
eyes.

 

John Keenan

“i‘ve never really thought much about it."l
replied easily, and slid my hand under the
counter to wrap it around a heavy length of
pipe the boss kept there to chase the loons
away with. The man didn't look like a crazy.
but working at Horizons Religiou-
Booh, l'd met my share of salvation ped-
dlers. My own personal experiences ranged
from the monk of the Order of the great God
Osiris, who'd offered to canonlze me, to a
very sincere lady In a very expensive mink
who’d sworn that only by living a life of com-
plete celibacy could I hope to enter the
kingdom of Our Lord. I've been damned 15
times by irate customers: it‘s a statistic I'm
rather proud of.

My noncommital reply didn't seem to faze
the little man in the slightest. “Well. you
really should, you know,"he informed me
earnestly. it's getting late, and soon there
won't be any more room left." He opened
his briefcase and began fishing around inside
It.

 

"Room for what,"l asked. when, with a
triumphant “Al-IA!" he jerked his hand from
the case. This startling combination Of noise
and movement almost earned him a pipe to
the temple. except I saw that all he held in
his hand was a flstful Of brightly colored
brochures. which he promptly handed to
me.

The pamphlets were bound tightly by a
large rubber band, and emblazoned across
the topmost leaﬂet was the eye-catching
legend,Valhalla; We're Looking [or a Few
Good Men!

I looked at that for a long time.

The brochures were a classy job. In all the
years l'd worked the counter at the store, l'd
never come across a more convincing form
of lunacy. in addition to the Valhalla blurb,
there were upwards of twenty other
brochures, regaling the wonders of such pro-
minent paradises as Hades, Elysium, and (lo
and behold)even Christian Heaven. The
man was a nut case, pure and simple, but
you had to admire a nut with that much
style. l pulled out the top brochure and flip-
ped it to him.

“Tell me about Valhalla," i told him.

“Oh, dear."he murmured, his round face
becoming momentarily fishlike in Its wrinkled
disapproval. “A very popular Ilrst choice,
sir. but most Of our clients reconsider. After
all. why would you want to go to a heaven
doomed to be destroyed?"

l was amazed. The man was attempting to
sell me an afterlifel lfelt laughter bubbling up
from inside me, but I managed to cut It off, a
sound like a strangled snarl emerging in its
place. All man, that was me! Viking from
womb to pyrel “Never mind that,"l grimac-
ed fiercely. “Just tell me about Valhalla!"

He sighed. and with a doleful shake of his
head. bent over his briefcase once again. It
took control to keep from laughing outright;
the man was so serious.

He was muttering under his breath as he
began flipping through a small, leather-
bound notebook. "When I think of all the
trouble they've caused. . .Val...Vallialla, here
it isl"

He looked up. “Well, there is room."

“What trouble?" i asked, The man was in-
triguing. so much so that l'd absent-mindedly
released the pipe. l leaned toward him.

“Well. sir,H he began,”as you may be
aware, the Norse...the vikings, you unders-
tand...l)e- lleved that after death all the
greatest heroes were summoned to the great
mead»ha|l Valhalla, where they would await
the final battle between good and evil that
would destroy not only mostpgods, but the
world itsfwelh‘Pf He paused {forbreatlL “That
battle...Ragnarok. i believe they called it...is

 

scheduled to take place on Novem- ber
, twenty-first." He glanced down at his watch

and smiled thinly. l‘Only twenty-one days
I from today. And that is why my company
has been contracted to fill as many heaven's
as we can before the end. We're experienc-
3 ed,"

The end of the world had to be a great sell-
ing angle. I thought. and felt a familiar tickle
in my ribs that told me i was very near
hysterlcs.

“Ah,” I said softly."l see. Well then. since
Valhalla...and the world...cease to exist in
only twenty-one (lays, what can you tell me
about...oh, say. Christian Heaven? And isn't
selling berths in a Christian Paradise sort of
contrary to the entire ideology?
Moneylenders in the temple, and all that?"

He smiled bcatlfically at me. “Well. sir.
we're hardly selling anything. actually.

 

“The on}! of‘tlle world had to be a great so
ing angfeJ I thought, and felt a familiar tickle “f. \.
my ribs that told me I was very near hysterical."

 

 

 

 

      
  
 

I

Christian ideology is sort of against the nl
tion‘of buying places in heaven...nowadays,
anyway. But the actual place In heaven is
free. Rather a good deal, l'd say."

“Free, huh?" l asked in disbelief.
"Nothing for you or the company?"

"Well, sir. if you're offering. I could rather
use some money...lust a bit. I mean, since
you're going to heaven and all. and I've still
got my job to do. These suits do get rather
expensive." ’

Just what l‘d thought. “Got the hell out of

there, you bastard." Softly. Very softly and

calmly.“People like you make me sick. You
tell me all i need is belief. then you ask me

‘for money. Well, I've got the belief, and I

don't need to give you my money to prove
iti" ”

V l'le regarded me steadily. “Do you really
think you have faith?" He shrugged. “You
don't, you know. And money or not, you're

' going to need that faith in a very short time."
. He swept the pamphlets back into his brief-
case. and turned to leave. I watched him
walk to the middle of the ﬂoor. pause. and
call softly. “Michael? No sale."

There was a flash, and a boom. and i
woke up.

The lightning, of course. The lightning
had awakened me. that and the thunder. I
rolled over on the bed. pulling my covers
tight about me and grlmaced. imagine
dreaming about that stupid little litCldL‘tli
every night since it had happened. And
these thunderstorms this past week. it's fun»
ny how storms can affect you.

As l rolled over. my eyes fell on that pam-
phlet lying on my clock radio. Yes. l'd kept
it. i picked it up.

Valhalla; We’re Looking for a Few
Good Mont

That was twenty days ago. And I'm wor'

 

.ried.
