lear up rules

the Editor:
cgnrdlng your letter in the October 7. 1983 edition of
ASP. it is obvious to me that there is a great
understanding of the rules and policies of thc AMlA.
crcforc. i felt that it is my responsibility to clarify a few
the discrepancies in your letter. To bcgin with, i must
55 the fact that the AMIA Council did not recently in-
utc it mandatory forfeiture to all teams for games played
bout proper signatures on rostcr shccts. this has always
n our policy. but only in the case of it being brought to
y i uttcntlon. i.c. the opposing team protesting the game.
-‘ wcvcr. toward the end of last scmcstcr. thc AMIA
uncil passed a tuotion that said we would actively seek
t illegal rosters and this new policy was properly posted
the AMIA display cnsc located in the Campus Center.
a, all team captains were informed of this new pro-
urc at the Softball Captains Mccling prior to the open-
of the Fall 1983 Softball season.
n response to the statement that in previous seasons
tch were available at “one of the ﬁrst couple of games
unsure proper signatures and complete rosters" i feel it is
cssnry to inform you that for the last three years it has
been the policy of thc AMlA to bring rosters to any
cs. rather. it has been left up to the captain to insure
at the proper amount of signatures were on his rostcr
or to his teams first game. Additionally. it is lhc AMlA's
« icy that teams are permitted to add players to their
tcr up until their third game. but that does not mean that
I y can play a game with less than the required amount of
~i-a uturcs on their roster; (Each team must have at least
eiht players to play a game.) The reason why this policy is
y vchcmcntly enforced is because each player's slgnuturc
4 1 cs as a medical waiver and a possible protection against
'gdl action for the AMlA. '
n reviewing your letter. it becomes obvious to me that
you do not have a ﬁrm and proper knowledge of the rules
and policies of thc AMiA. whether it bc softball or any
other sport. What I can suggest is that you. and perhaps the
other 23 teams you spcak of. take a little time out to read

' the rules of the AMlA which are handed out at the Cap-
tain's meetings of each sport sponsorcdby the AMIA. and
keep abreast of the changes in AMlA policy by way of the
AMlA-WIRA display case. if there is still some
misunderstanding as to thc interpretation of the rules.
picasc feel free to stop by the intramural Ofﬁce located on
the first floor of the Gym or come to any AMlA Council
mtctings which are held cvcry Thursday night at 6:30pm.
in CC373.

Not so comic strips

To the Editor:
' For the past few wccks, readers of the ASP huvc bccn
subjected to a comic strip by R.A. i-lnycs. Thcsc strips hch
centered attention around “loonics”, "looncy bins", and
‘lmcn in white juckcts'.‘. respectively. in thc Octobcr 3rd.
7th. and lllh issucs of the ASI’J huvc workcd with thc
rncnlally impaired and-physically disublcd since 1 was a
senior in high school. i run now a senior at Albany and huvc
found that discrimination against both groups has not
diminished in the least bit.

-’ l feel that Mr. Hayes’ comic strips are tusfclcss cxumplcs
 this discrimination and feel that thc ASP should
jecvuluatc their position on humorlcss, discriminatory

‘T

misummpm-n . —, m .  NH. __‘ >

comic strips. such as “Otis”. which insist on using the men-
tally impaired as subject matter. If Mr. Hayes feels that
poking fun at the mentally impaired is acceptable,I i sup-
pose that we can expect more comic strips from him which
use derogatory terms. May 1 remind you that these strips
compound and perpetuate the ideas and prejudices that
most people have by turning these groups into subjects of
humor.

1 also feel that if Mr. Huycs' crcativity does not allow
him to find suitable subject matter for his comic strips. then
he should scrlousiy reconsider drawing comic strips for the
ASP.

Issue isn’t simple

To the Editor:

i would like to scttlc this ROTC qucstlou once and for
all. i will address mysclfto the October lllh lctlcr cntitlcd
"Congratulations due" by David Jnnowcr.

Mr. Junowcr states that the issue scents a simple one.
However it is quite evident from his article that he has ub-
solulcly no idea what the issue is.

Mr. Janowcr. we in America live in a democratic society.
that means we elect officials who make the public policy
and laws that govern our society. The law states that
homosexuals arc barred from service in the Army. Navy.
Air Force. Murincs, CIA. and the NSA. That is a congres-
sional law. People who wish to test the law bring their cases
to the Supreme Court. in every case lilill has comc before it
the Supreme Court has upheld the law.

Now Mr. Jttnowcr. you would have us ubundon public
policy and substitute it by your own private policy. You
would have us ignore the laws made by officials elected by
the democratic process and in turn comply with your own
privuic laws that would remove ROTC from our campus.

1 sinccrly wish that it wasn't ncccssury to explain the
democratic process to a mcmbcr of the university faculty.
but by your letter you ltnvc demonstrated that you don't
know how it works. So i will continue.

if you fch that this law is unjust then you change it by
petitioning your clcctcd ofﬁcials. You have 16,000 students
of voting age that go to this school. Mr. .lunowcr. Why
don’t you start a lcltcr or pctititon drive to your con-
grcssinun. That. Mr. .lanowcr. is how we chnngc laws. not
by ignoring them and substituting your own.

— Jonathan A. Newman

Democracy reigns

To the Editor:

As the guardian of the frcslnnan class, i fch it is my
rcsponsibility to respond to Mr. Steve llcllcr's letter of
Tuesday. October 11. I983.

I am sorry that Mr. Hcllcr finds it "distressing" than the
l’rcsidcnt. Vicc l’rcsidcnt. Sccrctary. and Trcusurcr arc
clcctcd within the Class Council consisting of fiftccn
university-wide clcctcd students. and that hc i'urthcr is in
tlisugrccmcnl bccuusc he feels lllill Ihc t'rcshnuui class us an
entity docs not have influence ovcr thc lcadcrship of their
class. l-lowcvcr, Ml. llcllcr is. in my opinion. worrying ovcr
nothing. Docs he not rcspccl his peers cnough in us much
that they will choose the most cornpctcnl I‘il‘tccu rcprcscn-
iulivcs. who in turn will elect a compctcnl cxccutivc
brunch?

drafted a version that will be presented to the elected Class
Council. They in turn will either accept it as drafted, or
revise it to their satisfaction and to the satisfaction of their
constituency that they were elected to represent.

The steering committee did not take complete control of
the class, but rather did what they thought was equitable at
the time. The students at the general interest meeting were
presented with all relevant facts l.c.: what happened last
year with the class of l984. They then discussed all
ramifications of their options. and then democratically
decided for an "in council clcction." Furthermore. they
still have the option of changing their decision by an
amendment to tile drafted constitution at the appropriate
meeting.

Mr. llcllcr is also confuscd to the fact that before any
class expenditure the class council must vote on the expon-
diturc. Furthermore. as it stands now. a person may
aciticvc voting rights on the class council by tlilcndlng three
consecutive meetings. The class council is not an elitist
body. but rather allows anyone who attends the regular
meetings to voice their opinions and suggestions.

If Mr. Heller or anyone else has any questions about the
Freshman class they may feel free to contact me at the Stu-
dcnt Association office.

Equal access

To the Editor:

l have read with interest the articles concerning ROTC
and thc cqual access policy here at SUNYA. Many of the
individuals who comment on this issue sccm unnwnrc ofthc
basic facts. if one looks closely. ROTC docs not appear to
be in violation of the equal access policy.

First, let me bc bold enough to assert that ROTC is not a
SUNYA course. and therefore does not fall under the equal
ucccss policy. unless this policy is interpreted in a manner
which I believe was not intcndcd. To enter Army ROTC.
M81” or MSIV (tin: courses fostering the heated debate)
one must cross-enroll at Rl’i. The main purpose of thc Ar-
my ROTC cxtcnsion (ycs-“cxtcnsion”) m SUNYA is to
save the SUNYA cadct from commuting to RH for his or
her military science classes. Further proof that Army
ROTC is not a SUNYA course comes from the SUNYA
83-84 undergraduate bulletin. where it is stated (p.l9)
"Cross-registration enrollments Illllhl be in courscs not
available from the University‘s curriculum."

if the Army ROTC cxtcnsion office is eliminated from
SUNYA, this will serve no purpose. SUNYA sludcnts will
still be able to cross-enroll an RH. for Army. Navy. or Air
Force ROTC (some SUNYA students commute for Naval
and Air Forcc programs now) whilc tulnlittcd homosexuals
hcrc ul SUNYA would still not be allowed access to cross-
rcgistcr for lhcsc courses. cxuctly thc situation that exists
with the Army ROTC cxicrtsion on cumpusl

Of course you could ntlcnipt to eliminate the cross-
cnrollmcni for ROTC courses complclcly but i personally
would consider this n violation of my own (and many
olhcrs‘) rights to rcgislct for ROTC. This presents a dilem-
nut to lliosc who oppose the Army ROTC cxtcnsion. Either
remove it and scrvc no purpose. or ciimiuutc ROTC cross-
rcgislrulion, which would Villlillt.‘ thc rights of countless
pcoplc.

Mr. .lunowcr in his icltcr to ihc ASP of the lllh of Oc-
tobcr siulcs. “Our cquul ucccss policy makes :1 strong stale-
mcnl that we bclicvc in something. lliltl no one may be
discriminated against for reasons not having to do with
their ability to perform academically." if Mr. Junowcr had
donc his homework. he would find that the handicapped

, and people with other mcdical problems may not be com-

tnissioncd in the militarylund therefore are not eligible for
ROTC). Yet. we bear little. if anything, from these in-
dividuals about equal access violations. (1 am not cquuting
guys to the handicapped.)

What it boils down to is this: Docs thc SUNYA policy in-
cludc cross-enrollment? Aren't schools like RPi already
obligated to equal access by federal law. even though
federal law concerning the military prohibits gays? if we
consider the last qucstion. we see that the contradiction is at
the fcdcral level, as has been asserted previously.
