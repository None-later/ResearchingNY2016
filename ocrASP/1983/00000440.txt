On Monday. after Reagan signs aJ
letter authorizing the establishment
of the “Reagan-Bush ‘84' " com-
mittee. Laxalt will file the necessary
documents with the Federal Elec-
tion Commission. An ofﬁce near
the Capital has been selected for the
committee. and the president's top

political affairs aides on the White -
-bably from almoat the beginning

House staff. Edward Rollins and
Lee Atwatcr. have been designated
to shift to the committee payroll.
In addition. key Reagan political
allies around the country have been
lined up for rcgional roles in the

campaign.
During the brief ncws con-
ference, Laxait said that Bush

"vcry definitely will be" involvcd in
tlic effort. “The committee will be

"from the front end on." he said.

While the 72 year old Reagan has
steadfastly refused to state publicly
whether he will run for second
term. Laxalt took up the question
of when the president made his
decision. '
“Consciously  I think pro-
it‘s been apparent to him as well as
all of us that this Job that he's
assumed cannot be effectively done
in four years." the senator said. tid-
ding: “He's probably focused on it
very actively in the last few days."

Reagan has frequently said that
hc was avoiding a declaration of his
campaign ititcntions because a for-
mal announcement would cost all
his actions in a politiai light.

' ' ' eagan. campaign committee to be established

Laxalt, who repeated the presi-
dent's reasoning on Thursday.
stated: “i think that his position in
delaying his final announcement
until after Congress adjourn: is en-
tirely appropriate.

“The month President Reagan
and I took office inﬂation had setti-
cd into double digits and the prime
rate of interest reached its highest
level... since the Civil War.“Bush
said. "Now. two years after we set
policies in place. the United States
has one big program to help every
American man. woman and child.
it's called economic recovery."

Bush said 3 million people hate
