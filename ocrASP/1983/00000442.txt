The Albany State women‘s soccer team
went over tlte .500 rriark with their-Hi victon
over Rl’l Tuesday. The win left Albany look-
ing forward to this weekend's tnatelrup with
tltc University of Rochester.
Albany's dominance was cpituriii/cd by
the shots on goal; playing at home. Albany
got off 42 shots while Rl’l couldn‘t manage
one. Despite this vast difference. the teams
came out at halftime deadlocked at (CH). “1
was getting worried,“ adtititted Albany Head
(‘oacli Amy Kidder. “l anticipated the team
having sortie trouble with Rl’l because of
their unorthodox style of play. livery time we
brought the ball up. the RH women would
just swarm all over the ball carrier." noted
Kidder.

'l'lIc l'oru goal spread could have easily
been doubled if the players had comet tcd on
sortie of their nuriicrous chances in the first
half. “We just missed a lot of our
shots."i\'idder said.

About 20 minutes into the second half,
Albany finally got on the board as striker
Kerry Young scored her sixth goal this year.
That first goal seemed to open things up for
the team; within the HUM 20 minutes. the

women added three more goals to their total.
('o-crtptaiu Dec Marfc tirade it 2-0 with her
fourth of the year; five minutes later. Sue
Slagel got her second of the year to put
Alliuny tip by three. Yotnig closed out the
scoring with her second goal of the game.

Rl’l proved to be a perfect opponent for
Albany; several of the 13 Albany players that
“etc suited up were lturt. “We had a chance
to play everyone who could play." said Kid-
dcr. “Those who played kept the garlic on the
offensive; the girls often confined the ball to
tile attacking tltird of the field."

Stopperhack Dana Slam. who played out
of position at swccpcr against Rl‘l. attested
to Albany's dominance. “it wasn't a very
competitive grune." commented Stunt. "The
brill very rarely crossed the riiidficld litre. In
the second half we started to pass better.
which led to our shots going in.

The team will face much stiffer competi-
tion on Saturday when they play Rochester.

ding Io the coach. things might be different
this year.

“\\’c certainly have the talent to win [his
yeat." said Kidder. "Rochester isn‘t having
their best year: it would be a feather in our
cap it'we could beat them." E
