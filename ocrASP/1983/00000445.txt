“Whatever position AV is in now
is a result of what SA wanted to do.
Mike Starr never had the power to
sign votrclrers. SA knew every
dollar that went for AV," l’opper
said. He added that the current
situation is neither shocking nor
surprising.

they were llre ones who decided

Starr qrrestioned the selling of the

don't lune money to keep sinking

When asked how useful AV

“for srrrall shows and srrrall groups
it‘s worthwhile. (lint) I wouldn‘t
