se of you who have cars are in a perfect
sition to cut out to.any one of the literally
iusands of great spots in the Catskills.
irondacks and Berkshires, all of which lie
thin an hour’s drive from the concrete
res of SUNYA.
Thatcher Park is the spot closest to home
at offers a real get-away atmosphere. /\
ort drive, or a longish bike ride away, That-
ier Park can be reached by driving toward
uiklerland on New Scotland Avenue. Ten
inutes up the road, there is a sign for the
rk. turn left and drive a bit further and
u’re there. Thatcher is great for frisbee
aying, picnics or just partying with friends.
here are also waterfalls and (’liifs to check
ut while you're kicking around.

Better known to SUNYA students are
amp Mohawk and Dippikill. Mohawk is the
loser of the two and is fairly easy to find.
To get there, take the Northway (117)
eading north to exit eight and take a left.
ou'll cross over the Mohawk River to get off

81‘. Go along for abotit a mile and then take
' your first left and you're there. Mohawk is
owned by SUNYA and is a great spot for pic-
nics. there are canoes for rent and sailing is
also possible. If you're just into hiking
; around or hanging out, it won’t cost you a
1: thing,

Dippikill is about 20 miles noith of Lake
George and 70 miles north of SUNYA. Run
 by the Student Association, the camp offers
hiking, camping and fishing for just the day

of ditferent sizes that can be rented if you

 

 

 

 

want to stay overnight. The cost is ittinimal
and the cabins are great, but you have to
make reservations well ahead of tinte. Day
hikes can be tnade on Dippikill Mountain or
you can take the trail up to the fire tower on
Crane Mountain and enjoy the great view.
Right now the water is low, but in the spring
you can also go water tubing at the (Eli-n.
Dippikill is a great bargain and has not squ
fered frotn overuse, making it an ideal pldtt‘
to enjoy the fall weather or just party for the
weekend.

if you' : more serious about your hiking, a
trip out to Lake George is definitely wor-
thwhile. On the north end of the lake stands

on a warm day, you can see anything from

Mark l)l‘.il\ to tattli-sitakt's hanging out and
enjoying lllt‘ sun. the \’tt'\\’ over the lake and
the surrounding area is iii-imiter wor-
lll\\'lillt‘.

the mountain leaw front the Village of LaktI
George and there’s even a toll road you an
drive up it you don't want tliiiikahles to get

hike and party when you get back, you can
stop on at llH' village watering holes on the
return trip.

about "high adventure" spots in our area.
He made two especially interesting sugges-
lions:

ln Corinth, New York. just below Sewart’s
Dam you can go inner tubing or rafting down
two miles of rapids as long as you’re wearing
a life present-r and are confident of your
swimming skills. If you go with a bunch of
people and you don't want to risk just stick-
ing your butt in an inner tube, you can rent a
huge raft Wlltt it you ( an rent from the people
at Adirondark White Waters for about ten
dollars a day.

Whether you're tanoeing, kayaking, or
just using a rail, there's nothing like the sheer
thrill of Wlillt' water. "It’s a great pace to go
and just have a blow-out good time," says
Wl'lllpll'. Corinth is ( lose to (.ilens Falls and
it takes about rit) minutes to drive there.

Anothei UM iting suggestion is a trip to the
