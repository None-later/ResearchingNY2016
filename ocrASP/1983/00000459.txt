At the ﬁrst Graduate Delegate Assembly
and Constitutional Convention held October
15 and lo. at SUNY Binghamton Graduate
Student delegates approved a new constitu-
tion that will include the recognition of a
Graduate Student Employees Union
(GSEU). GSEU, which represents l.000
employed SUNY Graduate Assistants
(G.A.s). Research Assistants (R.A.s), and
Teaching Assistants (T.A.s) was approved
“nearly unanimously" according to Keith ln-
glis, steering committee member from

UNYA.

The conference which included represen-
tatives from all four University Centers was
the result of a long struggle that began in
I974. According to Gary Cittrczak statewide
president of the GSEU. the union started at
the University of Buffalo in I974 arid then at.
tempted to be recognized by New York
Public Employees Relations Board
(NYPERB). “But,” said Ciurczak, “they
were told they had to be statewide." The efr
fort thus died as did a similar effort in I977
he added.

In l98l. Ciurczak explained. students at
Buffalo decided to try to make GSEU
statewide. The major enrollment drive. ac-
cording to Ciurczak began in November
l982, and by May l983, several IL ‘

Graduate Student Union receives recognition

 

 

Graduate students have not been led to
believe that they are doing a good job. l-lav-
ing a union would encourage a feeling of pro-
fessionalism and a committment to quality.

 

 

names had been collected and were submitted
to NYPERB.

The weekend convention was described by
Steve Tesser. a SUNYA math T.A., as hav-
ing “lots of exciting controversy." "We ap-
proved a consititution that's important to all
G.A.s. R.A.s and T.A.S on campus. All ma-
jor decisions that the union will make or par-
ticipate in will be decided upon by the
membership." '

According to Ciurczak the union will final-
ly give G.A.s. R.A.s and T.A.s a "legally
recognized bargaining agent” to negotiate
with SUNY for pay scales and other beneﬁts.

“A GSEU would organize Graduate

Students and perform the act of collective
bargaining for G.A.s, R.A.s, and T.A.s to
make certain minimal guarantees, such as in.-
come." said Tesser. “it’s just luck," he add-
ed, “at Albany we‘re fortunate. other
Graduate students are forced to teach two tc
three classes because they don't have a con-
tract."

However. while the GSEU is on the road to
development. the Graduate Student Associa-

 

 

 

tion is still developing. The G.A.s. R.A.S
and T.A.s are still striving to establish a
Graduate Student Association at SUNYA.

“Albany is the only campus without a
Graduate Student Association," said Inglis.
The GSA would be similar to the Student
Association working for undergraduates at
SUNYA, he added.

“it would seem to me that SA would
benefit by having a GSA on campus. A lot of
the things that SA is interested in a GSA
would also be interested in, such as lawyers,
and major medical health insurance plans."
Inglis noted.

According to Tesser under the present ma:
jor medical health insurance plan only
graduate students who are United States
citizens can benefit from the program. "That
eliminates at least half of the G.A.s. R.A.s
and T.A.s at Albany. What kind of plan is
that?" questioned Tesser.

Both Tesser and lnglis stressed that a

n

     
 
 

 

 

 

Graduate Student Association would only
improve the quality of SUNYA. “It is to
SUNY's advantage if the Graduate Students
become more professional and increase the
quality of education and research and SUNY
as a whole." Tesser said.

lnglis noted that Graduate Students have
not been led to believe that they are doing a
good job. Having a uttion and a professional
status, he explained. would encourage a feel-
ing of professionalism and a commitment of
quality in education and research. “That is
our most important reason for forming a
Graduate Student Association." he said.

The GSEU still has another battle to light.
Tesser stressed. Presently the GSEU has a
written constitution, a delegate assembly and
an executive committee. he said. “Our next
big task at this point is getting the state to
ceritfy us as the legal bargaining agent for the
funded Graduate Students throughout the

Marketing manager tells why Coke

 

 

coca-Cola Vice President Thomas”Bontatr
"Diet Coke was an unparalleled success in marketing. "

 

 

By Mike Taubleb

One of the most effective ways to learn
about any subject is from leaders in the field.
and when it comes to marketing. Coca Cola’s
leadership is evident, according to the Ex-
ecutive Vice President of the North East
Coca Cola Bottling Company. Thomas Bon-
fair. Bonfalr spoke on the subject “How is
‘Coke it' " held Tuesday afternoon in LC 18.

The lecture was a combination of advice to
prospective marketing majors and a
demonstration of these techniques in action
as integral parts of Coca Cola's successful
promotion of Diet Coke.

Bonfair spoke of “winning, working hard,
being a strategist and getting involved as the
major attributes of a good marketing
manager."

Addressing a nearly full lecture center. the
Vice President lamented the lack of strategic
thinking in students entering the profes-
sional marketing field. He labeled strategic
thinking. “the dynamic ntovemcnt and
countermovement of forces. The Japanese,"
he explained, “ have natural talent in
strategic thinking. Few business schools exist
there. ncvcrthclcss American in-
dustry—especially tlte automobile manufac-
turers—have a lot to learn from them." he

said.
prospective marketing executive must be
prepared for failure and success, and to start
at the bottom." He then elaborated on Coca
Cola's application of successful marketing
strategies in its struggle to increase its share
of the soft drink market.

“The successful introduction of Diet Coke
into the intensely competitive soft-drink
market was an unparalleled success in

 

UI’S
SUNY system." Tesser explained.

Members of the GSEU are also considering
affiliation with a National Union. One
member stated. “Affiliation with a National
Union would allow us access to information
and people who are used to bargaining with
the state." “We were given the authority to
go ahead and go into negotiations, but
general membership will have to approve it."
Inglis added.

A total of twenty-seven graduate studcnh
attended the conference in llinghaniton, in»
cluding five representatives from Albany.
Tesser and Inglis, two of the attendees both
agreed that the conference was a huge success
and a step in tire right direction for Graduate
Students statewide. “i went there Worried
about politics and power plays." said Tcssct.
“but the amount of dcdicatiott and good
feelings that were generated by the delegates
was really inspiring."

is really it

marketing history." asserted Bonfair. adding
that “one million cases were sold itt New
York in one month. Behind this success was
an intense level of secrecy concerning the
name and nature of Coke’s new product.
Such tactics as code names and routine swit<
ching of ofﬁces mislead the competition
enough to prevent anyone from entering a
similar product on the market before Coke,”
Bonfair said.

A short promotional film dealing with the

preparation for Diet Coke's introduction was
shown midway through the lecture. Justify-
ing the large cost of Diet Coke's advertising
campaign. the Vice President claimed. “the
best of everything should be invested in pro-
moting the best product."
Speaking on the role of the marketing ex-
ecutive, Bonfair maintained, “it is tliejob of
the marketing department of a company to
develop products that consumers want." He
said. “the marketing executive should not
consider his own individual preferences and
should understand the effect of public rela-
tions on the successful protnotion of a pro-
duct." This was evident iti tltc wuy Cokc
manipulated the media to focus significant
coverage oti the introduction of Diet Calm to
"‘0 Public." Comtttenting on the necessary
evil of cannabilization —— when one prodttct
steals a share of the market frotn another
product of the same company — Bonfair
assured that. "Coca Cola catnc ottt ahead.
though Diet Coke has deprived Tub of SOHW
of its market."

“How is ‘Cokc it': Strategic Thinkintt in
Relation to Marketing Diet Coke" was Spon'
sored by the Delta Sigma Pi fraternity and

Two prominent Danish
businessmen were appointed to the
Dean's Advisory Council for the
School of Business. They are Hans
Goth Paaschburg, managing direc-
tor of the Danish bank Privat-
banken Akticsclskab. and Christian
Rovsing A/S. the largest manufac-
turer of computer equipment iti
Denmark.

The council tnects every six mon-

tits to discuss such basic issues as
student reeruiting and placement in
business. public relations, fundrais-
ing, and internationalization for the
school.
i The dean of the School of
Business. Harvey Knlialas, traveled

In meetings with Paascltburg and

they were very interested in higher
education. lioth are on advisory
counsels to universities in Den—
mark. "When I requested that they
joitt the council here at Albany,
they readily agrecd," said Kzilitilas.

The advisory council was in-
itiated last year by Kahalas who has
served as dean of the business
school for the past two-nnd»a-half
years. To assemble tltc group, the
dean, with the ltelp of business

Patricia White. speaking at the Oct.
l9 Research on Women Collu-
quium.

“The reason women wished to
stay single," explained White. a
doctoral student at SUNY
Binghamton. "was not because

9 Danish advisers chosen

might join the council. "I tried to
get a cross section of the business
comtnttnity on the panel." he said.

Local appointees provided con-
tacts throughout the state. The
panel has tnembers from New York
City businessesI national and inter-
national concerns, and the New
York State Court of Appeals.

The council met for the first time
last April and converted again two
weeks ago. “The advisory council
has been terrific," says Ktthnlas. “It
is an excellent exatnple of the
positive relationship that can exist
between the private sector and
higher education.” it

there was a shortage of eligible
men. but because there were
economic factors to consider.
Women were not pleased with the
demands of married life and didn’t
want to be confined to a limited
sphere of activity. For the ﬁrst
time. they could earn an lmcome
sufﬁcient to live on. and many of
thctn liked the financial in-
dependence."

White said that she has found
trends. “Many of the single women
were native-born Americans of im-
migrant parents," she noted. “The
parents expected their cltildrcn to
climb the social ladder. The
daughters went to work and didn’t
have a chance to meet men or
didm't want to after they had had a
taste of independence." she told
her audience of about 20 women.

Single wotncn from Albany.
Schenectady and Troy are included
in her studies, White said, explain-
ittg that these are ideal socio-
economic pools since the thrce were

different in the early 1900's but
within the same locale. According
to White, Troy was a city bf textile
factories, Schenectady was
dominated by General'Electric. and
Albany had more diverse factories
and an opportunity for women to
obtain clerical jobs.

White’s study also takes into ac-
count 0ther single women: nurses.
teachers, nuns. artists. and eldest
daughters who stayed home to
fulfill househould duties when their
mothers died and who remained
single. White explained.

According to White. the high rate
of single women in the early l900‘s
had an effect on history. Women
became tnorc independent and did
not feel inferior, White added.

One of the women attending the
presentation thought that it was
“fascinating that women were in-
terested in independence and work-
ing for a living then." But another
woman found it hard to believe that
“a few, uneducated immigrants
could change the course of history

I . Economic factOrs forcingwomen to stay single

and give women more freedom."

White said she was excited when
she came across evidence of a sports
club called the Women's Gym-
nasium Club which existed from
I899 to l906. She explained that
this club set up a memorial fund in
honor of its founder Etta Lansing
Wentz. which paid for the cost of
nursing bills of self-supporting
women of limited means. White
concluded that single women in the
early l900’s knew about each other
uttd wanted to help.

White said her sources include
the census data at the state library,
annual reports of the Albany Guild
of the Care of the Sick. annual
reports of the YWCA. editions of
the Titties Union from the early
l900's and literature of that era in—
:luding Century Magazine. North
Amer/can Review. Atlantic Mon-
Iltly. and Harper's Bazaar.

White is currently living in
Albany and working on her thesis,
the basis of which will be her study
of single women, D
