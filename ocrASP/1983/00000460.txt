Lenardon shows

 

By Art Vldro

An Ohio State University professor who
visited SUNYA two years ago said he loved
Albany so much he has come back to the
university for his last year of teaching. after
which he'll retire and permanently settle in
the area.

 

Classics professor Dr. Robert J. Lenardon

has a slight build, sometimes wears thick-
lensed eyeglasses, and always exudes a little-
boy quality. a little-boy laugh and a constant
twinkle in his eyes. He is teaching Greek
Mythology. Beginning Greek. and Fifth Cen-
tttry Athens this semester.

"His love for the material comes through
in each lecture," Lsaid one mythology stttdent.
“Because of his enthttsiasm. it's easier for us
to be interested."

This enthusiartt spurred Lenardon's entry
into the classics field. "i read Homer." he
recalled. “and reading Tire Iliad convinced
me i wanted to be a
classicist." 

in the classroom. Lenar- .
don supplements his talks 
with audio and visual aids.

“l play tapes in many courses." he said. He
also shows many slides. particularly in the
large mythology course. “it just makes it
more interesting—l hope." Lenardon
chuckled. "Where it's appropriate. i use it."

“l'd like to consider myself a demanding
teacher. not a pushover. But the students. l
suppose. are better Judges of that."

"The students required pushing, and he
never really pushed us," said Jennifer Her-
rala. a former Latin student of Lenardon's.
“And it was too easy to get him off on a
tangent. But It’s not like he's a pushover."
She said Lenardon was fairly strict when
grading tests. "He had a lot of resources on
hand," she said. “and that added a lot to the
course."

Classics Department Chairman John
Overbeck says Lenardon is “a quiet fellow. a
nice person easy to get along with."

Herrala agreed. Lenardon is "willing to
bend over backwards to help you.“ site said.
“if you were stuck on (translating) a (Latin)
word. itc'd give it to you. He couldn’t bear
the sight ofa struggling student. especially itt
little tiny classes. it you ever need help out of
class. he‘ll give it to you itt buckets." But she
also said Lenardon "wasn’t easy to get to

know personally."

“i’ve been told." said Lenardon. “that
like many shy people. I sometimes seem cold
and reserved. They may be right. it takes a
while to get to know me."

Lenardon said he's a native Canadian.
grew up in Ontario. and came to the US. on
a scholarship to the University of Cincinnat-
ti. where he earned his M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees in classics. in addition to Greek and
Latin literature and language. Lenardon says
he also studied archeology and history. He
says he feels fortunate to have studied with
Blegen—the famed excavator of Troy and
l’ylos. and to have had Malcolm MacGregor.
a reknowned (ireck historian and
cpigraphist. as his l’h.l). advisor.

lit the early l‘)5()'s Lenardon taught at Col-
uttthia Univcrsity. "i suppose that spoiled
ttte." ltc said. "i ttiaays wanted to get back
to New York.“ After a [caching siittl at Scul—

added.

Lenardon joined SUNYA for the i9iil-82
academic year. according to Overbeck. “He
was an addition to the staff. He came for a
year’s visit. then went back to Ohio State,"

“i knew people in the department,"
Lenardon said of his decision to come to
Albany. "i thought it would be a nice
change. The wanted me here because of my
interests and (for) the areas in immunities
they were trying to develop."

This year Lenardon is art exchange pro-
fessor. according to Overbeek. “He's cx-
changed places with llaus A. Poltisander.
Admittistrativcly. it‘s very simple. Both men
are still on their own university's payrolls;
they're just swapping offices." Lenardon
teaches the classes “that Mr. l’ohlsandcr
would have tartgitt had he been here.” said
()vcrbcek. “it's good to ltavc sorltcbody dif-
fcrcttt for u change. for variety. l'ic (i,cnur~
don) particularly wanted to conic here for his
last ycttr hci'ot‘c retirement."
