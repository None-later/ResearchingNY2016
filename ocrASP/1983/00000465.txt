as very disappointed with the column In your October
ssuc. “The Politics of Pornography." by Ken Dorn-
. What began as a fairly objective. interesting article.
orth by facts (if not always incontrovertible facts),
kly degenerated into an individual's tirade against men
cncrnl. l regard statements like “Trying to take away
3 from a man is like trying to trikc away candy from a
' .” and “The obvious hatred picturcd within the
crinl lets women know exactly where they stand in
‘5 eyes" as offensive and bigoted.

agree that ribusivc pornography is a subject that should
iscusscd. and that by definition a column is an cxprcs-
. of the columnist's opinion; but when this opinion crui-
bc expressed without prejudice it becomes dangerously
ted to “misogynous propaganda" iisclf.

grade. A full well rounded education has been replaced by
concentrated effort to get marks and get out. The past at-
piosphcrc of the college community has turned into a cut
throat competition center where the students only concern
is for him- or herself. Are we turning out better people, well
adjusted and ready to help their fellow man? Or are we pro-
rig. They were muladjusted. self-centered. rude. uncaring
individuals. it is my opinion that this institution should
focus more on producing wcll adjusted socially concerned
young adults. rather then the self ccntcrcd uncaring in-
dividuals i see emerging today. Education involvcs matur-
ing and growing not just book learning rind memorization
of material. We must return to [lie time when students were
socially aware and conccrncd. If we are to produce a better
society in which 10 live our cmphiisis must change.

the candidates. What it appeared to be In the eyes of one
who watched the campaign very closely was a last-ditch ef-
fort to secure a position for a friend without regard as to
how hard the other candidates worked. This fact is further
confirmed in that only the candidate Steve Sinatra was en-
dorscd by Rich Schaffcr. The other four quads were also
electing one Central Council member, but no candidate was
endorsed. Why was only the candidate from Alumni cn-
dorscd? .

On Tuesday night. the final night of the election. both
the Britbachcr and thc Waterbury-Alden cafeterias were.
“invaded” by a crew of Sinatra supporters. including our
very own Central Council representative. Steve Russo.
Whiu ihcy did was clcctionccr in both cafeterias, iln illegal
action. On Monday night they attempted to frame the main
opponent. Nathaniel Churny. by complaining that he was
clcciionccrlng in the cafeteria. when in fact he was respon-
ding to the question of which side of the cafeteria the poll-
ing was taking place that night. Upon the failing of this
plot. ihcy proccdcd to take the rules of the election commit-
tcc into their own hands. The manager of the Brubnchcr
cul'ctcrin had three of them removed from the cafeteria for
illegal entry through the oiiisidc door and for clcctionccr-
ing. They were witnessed to be standing around the voting
booth in liriibrichcr. I hope to gnthcr the names and
testimonies of the witnesses illid io present them to the elec-
iion corniiiiticc. l witnessed similar activities in thc Walden
cui‘cicriri. rind hrivc filed it complaint.

liven stranger was the fact thru one person in Brubdchcr
ovcrhctird the statement. "We only need seven more votes
to win ltru.” even before the polling was closed. At 7:00
p.rii. Tuesday night. well over three hours before the results
were announced on WCl)ll. Steve Russo and clan were
running through Alden Hall with cliiiiiiprignc. proclaiming
ilirii Sicvc Siiiriirri lirid won by four votes. Is there some sort
of boiling between the S./\, ()l'i‘icc rind llic Sieve Sinnira
lcriiii'.’ l have some very serious doubts (In to the vrilidity of
this clcction. ziiid l inicnd lo see thru justice is ridiiiiriistcrcd
rind thru this prist election is lll\’tllli.lilll.'(l.

If this is the wriy S.A. inicnds to run their elections. lllL‘il
tiiiiybc they should chringc their name to LISA. (Friends of
