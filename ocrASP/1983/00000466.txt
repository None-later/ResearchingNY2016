ter with respect to her renewal or
no-rcncwal in any forum including
the grievance procedure. Article 33
of the collective agreement between
tin.- parties (UUP and SUNY). the
Division of Human Rights. or Stun:
or Federal Court." “I took this to
mean that there would be rto legal
action." added Wclch.

According to Chen. she signed
the letter and understood the clttusc
to mean that she. "would not con-
tcst any of President O'Lcary’s
previous non-renewals. It didn't
mean the Chancellor‘s review."

Welch stated that tltc rcvicw
upheld the position of the Universi-
ty. and that Chen was removed
from the stuff on February 28.
I983.

Professor Chen has said that.

"while looking over tltc
(,‘Itttnccilor's Itcvicw (‘otntnittcc's
rcvicw process and its limit ncgutivc
decision. I became till the more

cnrugcd with the C(illttllllillltlitlg
power of a campus president."
Chen has claimed [hill "in order to
procurc favored consideration for
his woman friend... A university
president can corrupt not only those
administrative personnel working
under him but also implicate the
SUNY Central Administration in
the act of continuing injustice to a
committed and dedicated faculty
member."

President O'Lcary tried to reaf—
ﬁrm his position by saying that lie
just wanted “people to understand
that it wasn't a one-person
decision." "The case was reviewed
four times and upheld all four
times." he emphasized. Cltcn cited
a recent article in the Sciiarreclady
Gazelle which stated that "Some of
New York State's best tenchch are
leaving their chosen profession
complaining of. luck of respect."
She has claimed that “if my case is
not rectiﬁed... it will scrvc as it
signal that academic quality is lit)!
serioust rcgttrdcd in SUNY.”

Since her dismissal. L‘hcn. who
received a doctorate Ill L'hincsc
Studios front Ynlc in l967. has been
very busy. "I have published onc
book. another is bcing rcvicwctl and
I'm finishing my third," shc said.
“I've also been busy with a research

Eight students who sued the New

Group last spring. in hopes of get-

the consumer awareness group.
have been denied class action status
in the case. This rcmovcd nearly $1
million in liability against

According to NYPIRG Director

denied the eight class action status.

unknown. Mid-Atlantic attorney

Ondrasik said scvcn SUNY cum-

and that NYI’IRG attorneys will try
to remove thrcc of those as

OCTOBER 21,1933 :1 ALBANY‘STUDENTPRESS 15

 

Washington. D.C. (CPS) Tltc
average malc faculty member last
year made over 55000 more titan his
female colleague. and contirtucd to
get higher raises than ltcr. a new
study by the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES) says.
Tltc gap between men's and
women's faculty salaries has widen-
cd steadily since a I977-7il low of
$3500. Lust year it reached 55374.
the NCES reports.

"Much of the overall difference
(in men's nttd woman's salaries) is
due to women being at the lower
Icvcl positions on their faculty.“
says Tom Snyder. nit NCES
analyst. Indeed. the report shows
there were 76,508 ntnlc professors
last year. compared to only 9654
fcntulc profs. At the instructor
level. however. 11.735 were women.
while l0.527 were men. Snyder
believes the salary-gender gap will
narrow IIS tnorc women work their
way up the ladder and achieve more
seniority.

“Another reason for the
discrepancy." Snyder says. "could
be the salary differences among dif-
ferent fields of study. More men.
for example. teach to engineering
and computer science fields, which
usually have higher pay sculcs than
other ﬁelds.

Mnlc faculty members also got
highcr raises last year — scvcn pct-

cent — compared to 6.7 percent for
women. Men out-earned women at
every academic level, the study
shows. Overall. male teachers carn-
cd an average $28,394 in 1982-83.
compared to 523.020 for women.
Tltc salary difference between men
and women varied from SIIOO for
bcgirtning instructors to nearly
$4000 for professors.

“The growing gap (between
tttctt's and women’s stilttrics) clearly
shows that there is still a lot of
discrimination against women in
education.“ snyt Judy Touchton,
associate director for the American
Council on [Education‘s Office of
Women irt Higher Education. Even
considering that many women are
newcomers to higher cducittion and
may teach itt Iowur-pnying ﬁelds.
"the report is proof tltut the pro-
gross women made iti IllL' .scvcntics
is still far from finished."
Tonclnon says. Furthermore. “the
proof is only the first step. Based on
this information. institutions need
to look at themselves and see that
men and women with comparable
years of service are getting paid
equally." ‘

The NCES report. which
surveyed 2748 public and private
schools nationwide. also found that
faculty salaries overall increased 6.9
percent last year. compared to a 9.2
percent increase for I98l-82.
