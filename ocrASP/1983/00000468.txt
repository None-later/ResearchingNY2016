18 ALBANY STUDENT PRESS C] OCTOBER 21,1983

Heated debate continues over 21 drinking age

 

By Karen Pirozzi
STA TE PRESS SERVICE

Right after you turn 19. and have
the right to drink legally. the New
York legislature is considering rais~
ing the drinking age to 21. The
measure is already highly controver-
sial. -

So far, some claim statistics show
that last year’s hike to 19 has prov-
en effective. but others say the pro-
blem is with neighboring states
which have drinking ages higher
than New York's. These states say
that counties bordering New York
are showing a higher rate ofalcohol
related accidents resulting from
young people crossing into New
York to drink legally. according to
Elaine Llccione. research analyst
for state Senator Frank Padavan.

“The drinking age in New York
has been 18 since prohibition.” Lic-
cione says. explaining the
legislature's seeming reluctance to
act too drastically last spring.
“some senators wanted to raise it
directly to 21 this past session.” but
the compromise of 19 was reached.

Of the states bordering new
York, New Jersey and Connecticut
have drinking ages of 2| and 20,
rcpcctively. Both have contacted
New York in regard to a uniform
policy. according to Liccionc. Pen-
nsylvania's drinking age is 21.
Massachusetts' is 20 and Vermont is
one of only 5 states in the nation
with an 18-year-old drinking age.
However. Liccione says. “a couple
years ago Vermont moved to raise
it." The bill was vetoed by the
governor, but "the date for institu-
tion of the bill was to have been
when New York raised ours."

Licclone is not sure how much

state-wide, but with Governor
Cuomo's support. she feels it will

hearing on November 4 in New
York City will give border states a
chance to discuss their objectives.
Protest is expected. Liccionc says.
and it will come from SASU and
state liquor dealers and bar owners.

Jim Tierney, SASU president,
says his group will lobby the

drinking age. SASU itself would
not be involved in the education
aspect. but would support groups
that were.

A‘ “massive protest" is also plan-
ned by bar owners across the state.

Dealers Association President.
Joseph Zarriello. The campaign is

legislature to push “real solutions"
to the problem ofdrunk driving. He
calls raising the drinking age a
“simplistic solution." and cites
greater enforcement of DWI laws
and increased public education as
possible alternatives. He argues that
increasing the drinking age is unfair
to people already given most of the
rights and reponsibiiities of
adulthood. "They give you a rifle
and put your body on tile line, but
they won't give you a beer when
you cotnc back borne." Tlcrncy

Five or six delegates from each
courtty compose the BOO-member
convention. where they approved
the fight against the new drinking
age as their number one priority this
year. included in the campaign will
be public service announcements
for both radio and television.

Zarrlcilo asserts that Cuonto is

' using the bill as a political tool and

that l9 and 20-year-olds have to
make their feelings known. He
countered possible» accusations that
bar owners are ignoring statistics
and don't really care about stopp-
ing DWI. “We itave other statistics
that show drinking outside the
home starts at 16." Raising the
drinking age won't stop drinking,
but will "just push l9 and 20-year-
olds to drink in unsupervised at-
mospheres. such as cars and
parties.“

the bill until all data is in.
However. Lewis says. the data
received from seven or eight other
states which have raised their drink-
ing ages show an average decrease
of 28 to 29 percent itt alcohol
related accidents. She stressed the
group's support for education and
rehabilitation where alcoitoi is con-
cerned. “Raising the drinking age
to 2| represents a social change as
well as a legislative otic. Social
change takes a witile for people to
get used to."

The national organization.
Remove intoxicated Drivers (RID)
Director Doris Aiken says that
although her group supports the
proposed bill because it will save
lives, what they would really like to
see is one national drinking age.
it's “unconscionable that states do
not get together and decide what it's
going to be." I‘i'm fed up with
bartenders." Aiken added as she

charged that tavern owners and
lawyers do not want to seg the pre-
sent system changed because of a
potential loss of business. “They
don’t really care. about saving
lives." she contended. The New
York State Bar Association
(lawyers), would not comment.

if road blocks and immediate
license revocation programs were
set up. Aiken said, people would
curtail drunken driving. “Safety
cheek points will deter people if
they think they'll get caught.” she

says.
The National Traffic Safety
Board recommends raising the

drinking age to 21 nationally also.
according to Jim Burnett. chair-
man. He calls young peeple

drivers: people who don't know
how to do either yet. We pttt them
is a social environment in which the
major fornt of entertainment iii the
nation is to drive somewhere where
alcoitol is being served. And then
we put titcnt on the road irt tip to
4,000 pounds of deadly weapon."

Some statistics on alcohol related
accidents since the l9-ycar-old
drinking age was instituted are
available. Malcolm Abrams. direc-
tor of research for the Department
of Motor Vehicles. says that iii the
period from December 5. 1981 to
June. 1982, five percent of alcohol
related accidents (368 of 7240) were
caused by l8-ycar-olds. For the
satnc period one year later, after the
drinking age was changed to 19. the
ﬁgure fell to 4.l percent (292 of
716I).

Abrams stressed that while tltcsc
statistics may suggest that the new
drinking age has been worthwhile.
more research is necessary before
conclusions can be drawn. '.'

library —— since it contains historical
federal archives — would be main-
taincd by the federal government.

Much of the Stanford-Reagan
museum controversy is centered
around the already-existing Hoover
institution, a conservative think
tank located on the Stanford cam-
pus and run under the auspices of
the university. "Last spring there
was a pctitiott circulated on campus
asking for an investigation of alleg-
ed partisan activities by tltc Hoover
institution." explains Stanford
spokesman Bob llcycrs. With facul-
ty and students already concerned
about Stanford‘s conservative ties
to the Hoover Institution. he says.
the prospect of adding Reagan's
library and museum has spurred ad-
ditional fears the university will
become too conservatively-
oriented.

the Reagan administration," Beyers
notes. “And Reagan has said .hat
the institute is one of the leading
sources of his ideas."

“We take various positions on
the role of the Hoover institution,"
noted 20 Stanford Law School pro-
fessors in a recent letter to a univer-
sity advisory panel studying the
library/musuem proposal. But “it
is quite another matter to embrace
what would antount to a major ex-
pansion of the functions and in-
fluence of tile “cover on campus,"
the law profs warned. "Over 200
faculty letters have been sent to the
committee on the library and
museum proposal." Beyers says.
noting lte can't remember “any
other issue on which so many letters
have been written."

Tltc advisory committee is
scheduled to meet with Stanford
President Donald Kennedy this
week to discuss preliminary findings
on the proposal, he says. Mean-
while. faculty members at Emory
University have voiced little if any
opposition to the university‘s recent
announcement it will operate and
maintain the Carter Center in
Atlanta. But tltc ccrtter —— a liberal
think tank and meeting ground for
world leaders — will be run
scperatcly front the library and
museum buildings. which will also
be part of the $25 ntillion Carter
complex.

"The Carter Center will be
operated and staffed by Emory
University." says center spokesman
Steven Hochman. "But it is not
located on university property. and
we will not be responsible for the
library and museum." he says. So
far. “we haven't ltad any objections
or controversy concerning the
university's involvement. But
Carter is also a professor at

Emory." Hochman adds. "so it's
not like the center is his only in-
volvement or presence wilit the
school." _ .
