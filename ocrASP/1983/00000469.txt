Logo licensing means big revenues for schools

sweatshirts and mugs this fall. The
traditional Nittany Lion with its old
block lettering are gone. -
They‘re victims of a renewed
campus pursuit of as much as
5500.000 in licensing revenues. in-
deed. more schools — mostly in the
province of the Third Federal
District Court in Pennsylvania —
soon may be junklng honored old
symbols and logos in favor of new
ones in the coming years. according
to various administrators.
trademark experts. and clothing
manufacturers.
The reason. they say, Is to make
it easier to control and lay claim to
the money to be made from

manufacturers who put collegiate
"allied marks" —- pictures of
mascots. school initials, etc. —— on
products.

“Everyone's getting tough about

the use of the logos." mourns a
mldwestern manufacturer of key
chains who says he recently reached
a none-too-amicable settlement
with a college over use of the cam-
pus' mascot on key chains.
“They used to be happy just to
have their names on an advertising
product." says the manufacturer.
who requested anonymity because
he makes key chains for “about a
dozen" other schools. “Now they
said ifl don‘t pay them. they'll just
make up a new logo they can
copyright. and freeze me out."

“Years ago." agrees Fran Lynch.

Penn State's assistant athletic direc-
tor. “schools were pleased to have
their names on things as a sort of
walking billboard. But along came
the budget crunch and. boom.

we've got to generate more
revenue."
Lynch speculates licensing

_revenue from the new logo and

symbol is worth a “potential”
$300,000 to 5500.000 a year.

Penn State took the unusual step
of just starting all over with a new
logo and mark instead of trying to
license the old symbols because “we
had 21 different Nittany Lions and
as many different type (styles) being
sold. and we wanted a uniﬁed iden-
tity."

But Stephen Crossland. head of

“You never know what might

NCAA rules require an athlete

prises. which helps license the
marks of .some 60 schools nation-
wide. points out Penn State is in the
only judicial district in the country
where courts have ruled against
schools in trademark rights with
private manufacturers who
marketed products without paying
schools.

“They took an ounce of preven-
tion." Crossiand says. “They
figured ‘lf we’re going to the hassle
(in the courts). why don't we go
ahead and change the marks?’ That
way. their right to license them is
unduestioned. and the old marks
still being printed without licenses
become worthless."

The University of Pittsburgh
recently lost a battle in the Third
District Court with Champion Pro-
ducts. which has been producing
shirts with the Pitt name and pan-
ther symbol since l936.

ln I980. Pitt had adopted a new
rule that firms must pay the school
a licensing fee plus a 6.5 percent
royalty. but Champion refused to
pay because of its long record of us-
ing the trademark without challenge
from Pitt.

the case is now on appeal.

A number of other schools are
facing similar problems. Bigham
Young, Virginia. and Georgia have
all recently threatened to go to
court to stop private firms from
marketing beers and drinks with
their names and initials on the cans.
None of the schools. however. has a
long record of defending its
trademarks actively.

To keep a good legal claim on the
marks. schools must have a record
of protecting the symbols. and must
be able to prove having “ﬁrst inter-
nal and commercial use" of them.
explains Edith Collier of the US.
Trademark Association.

Some schools can't even say
where their symbols came from.
since many originally were the in-
formal work of students or local ar-
tists. points out Roy Parcels. head

of Dixon and Parcels. the New
York design firm that created Penn
State’s new look. I

The result can be the 21 different
versions of the same mascot like the
Nittany Lion. or other symbols that
may not be "distinctive" enough to
provide an identity to ﬁt trademark
law. he adds.

in trying to create a new. distinc-
tive Nittany Lion. for example.
Parcels discovered 125 ,four-year
and 37 two-year colleges around the
country are currently using some
kind of cat as a symbol.

Parcels also recently created a
new visual identity for Georgia
Southern College.

But adopting wholesale changes
and risking the wrath of tradi-
tionalists — and grammarians
(Penn State, for instance. is now
written as PennState in the new
trademark scheme) — can be expen-
sivc.

Fisher won‘t say lrow much Penn
State spent on the new logo. He
does remember the first bid he got
from a firm was for 8150.000.
HThat." he recalls. “was a short
conversation."

Crossland says throwing out all
the old for a new identity "really is
not a practical route unless there‘s a
strong likelihood of getting tied up
in litigation" over licensing
somewhere down the road.

“They would irave changed
everything in a minute.“ contends
the midwestern manufacturer about
the lliinois school that recently
“blackmailed me" into paying a
licensing fee.

it may be worth it. Crossiand
.says officials of the highly-
successful National Football
League licensing program estimate
"that if colleges ever got themselves
organized and together. they could
do 10 times as much as the NFL."

That would amount to some $3.5
billion a year in revenues for the na-
lion's campuses. i'J

 

he has the power
to see the future.

coach Mari Warner seemed very
pleased with the performance of her

rescheduled the two games that

both of them."

it was a season of ups and downs
for the Albany State women's ten-
