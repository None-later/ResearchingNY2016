NBC News said British troops
also were involved.

The reports came after a con-
tingent of 50 U.S. Marines \vus’sccn
leaving Monday afternoon in
helicopters from the nearby Carri-
bcan island of Barbados and
heading in the direction of
Granada.

A U.S. Embassy official in Bar-
bados would not say where the
Marines were headed but said it was
possible they would be used to help
evacuate Americans in Grenada
who wished to leave because of tile
political turmoil there.

A Pentagon spokesperson. Army
Sgt. Ray Kopaniasz. said "Wc'vc
heard the reports. but we can't con-
ﬁrm It."

Radio Free Grenada had been
transmitting throughout the night
but it suddenly went off the air
without signing off at about 6:16
am.

But House Speaker Thomas P.
