tcers around the country have
wn more optimistic in recent

‘l think recruiting is going to be
by 15 to 20 percent nationally
m last year," says Victor Lind-
st. placement director at Nor-
cstcrn University in Evanstort,
, and author of the Endicott
on, a national survey ofstudcnt
cements. "That's still down
at what it was two years ago,
ch less three years ago," lie
5. “I don’t see any sudden ttrrn.
sis goirtg to bc a gentle turn."
indquist and others ltavc little
d data on which to base their op-
ism, bttt they take heart from
trickle of rccruitcrs moving
k onto campttscs as tall
ttiting season starts. "Tire big
g is that we’ve been on it
award curve for some time.”
I 5 Jack Shittglctort, Michigan

al student job survey. “1 think

dquist observes. “Hiring of

naliy last year." Shinglclon says

"“lgAt the University of Texas-
'Austin, “it looks better than last

at Texas' business school. "Last

'alls. “This year we're back up to

at nearly the rate they were last
at at this time."
One of live firms that signed tip

lifornia-Berkcley last fall cancell-
, Berkeley placement head James
iggs says. He says the number of
tcdulcd interviews is up slightly
5 year, and tire firms he's talked
are more confident. “People
{i ally believe that we're in a

timistic, and companies an-
ipate a return to growth.“ “Last

i Dresser's personnel office.
- Rather than have people relocate

. to hire about 800 new graduates
nnually, still has “a few

ccruling “very limited," Papalcx-
is says.

Some energy ﬁrms, however, are
tuning to show up again at Texas,
aync says. Phillips, Gulf. Conoco
nd Shell have returned after a
car's absence. Energy recruitment
‘almost ceased to exist" last year,

Payne says. “Banks and accounting
came through the recession almost
like there won't one." He observed
a minor slowdown in recruiting by
high tecltnology companies. “lBM
had been sending 25 interviewers,"
he says. "Last year it was down to
about 12 or 15. it's back to 20 this
year."

The market for teachers still ap-
pears to be sluggish. despite the
rash of new proposals for higher
teacher salaries and more teacher
hiring. Yet, “the school population
is still declining, and budgets are
still tight," says Northern lowa's
Wood. “i think that things will pick

Berkeley‘s llriggs says some
recruiters are rctttrttirtg with a
grcatcr‘ appreciation for liberal arts
majors. They show increased in-

recruiters. But some of the place-
ment ofﬁcers' tentative optimism
rests on timing.

Lindquist. for example. believes
the 1984 prcsidcntlal elections will
inspire “a lot of economic pump
priming in tltc next few months. if
we get a sense of euphoria about the
ccottomy out ofthat, it will improve
Reagan's chances, and it will im-
prove campus recruitment." “If
you really want a good hartdlc on
what‘s going to happen, talk to
{Federal Reserve Chairman) Paul
Volcker," I.irtthttist advises. “It's
going to dcpcnd on whctltcr the

One ol‘ the ripples of economic
