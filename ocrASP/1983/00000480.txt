(CPS) This fall's experiments in
clamping down on student drinking
—- experiments performed almost
simultaneously by a huge number
of schools now — have inspired a
series of tough new rules on student
behavior, but an initial check with
colleges across the country indicates
students are willingly adapting to
their drier campuses.

"We didn't have the ‘bccr
suckers' that have always been
around before." Mike Jewell, a
member of the University of Ken-
tucky's Phi Delta Theta house.
observes gratefully. His house and
all the other Kentucky fraternities
agreed to hold dry rushes for the
first time ever this fall.

Bar owners near the University of
Oklahoma campus arranged to ac-
comodatc a crowd of 5(XX) students
at a rally to protest the sttttc's ncw

MacDonald was listcd in poor

time he was dropped off. . .that he
was ever going to be coming out of

brings good results, and keeps the
people away who only come for the
free beer anyway,” observes
Jonathan Brant. head of the Na-
tional lnterfraternity Conference. It
also shows “that fraternities are
something besides beer busts." he
added. Not all student groups are
happy about the way schools are
going about controlling student
drinking, however.

“We're all for" controlling
drinking. says Bob Bingaman, head
of the State Student Association in
Washington, D.C.. which coor-
dinates state student activities
around the nation and also helped
Kansas and Georgia students ward
off drinking age hikcs last spring.
"But students are responsible
enough to sensitize themselves
without having legislatures making
decisions for them." he argues.

lloth legislators and school ad-
ministrators are making those deci-
sions nevertheless. and at an in-
creasing pace over tltc last ycnr.

Maryland. Oklahoma. Arizona
State, Alabama. Virginia, St.
Bonaventure and many others have
simply banned drinking on at least
parts of their campuses. Fraternities
like those at Kentucky and North
Dakota State voluntarily have
begun dry rushes and special
alcohol-free activities. At Loyola
College of Maryland. students must
now don special wrist bands to get
liquor at campus parties. Students
caught violating the new policy -
by giving a wristband to an under-
agcd drinker. for example — can he
kicked out of student housing.
thn the University of
Maryland‘s under-aged population
“plummeted from only 25 percent
of the (student body) to over 60 per-
cent this year, we just decided to
put an cnd to all drinking on cam-
pus. rather than try to deal with all
the enforcement problems,"
reports Sandy chcrctt, llIc assis-
tant rcsldcnt life director. “Since
the majority of students can't lcgni-
ly drink anyway," adds Anona

Students willingly adapt to “drier” campuses

Adair of the Unlverslly of
Oklahoma. "there simply cannot be
any alcohol on campus."

Town police have been spot
checking parties at Millersville State
College in Pennsylvania this fall,
hunting for under-aged drinkers
and enforcing the city’s new nolsc
law.

lllinols State students now must
get permission from town officials
15 days before holding any outdoor
parties.‘ Then they have to have
security guards at the parties.

Marquette. Michigan officials
passed a tough new noise and litter
ordinance designed to control par-
ties on and near the Northern
Michigan University campus.
“We‘re seeing a real turnaround in
the way alcohol is being viewed not
only by administrators. bttt by
students themselves." says (lcrardo
(ionzalcl. president of liACCllUS,
a national group aimed at coniroll~
ittg studcnl drinking. “More and
more schools are integrating new
policies to limit drinking, and show

that alcohol doesn't have to be an
inherent part of college life." he
reports.

The control efforts began in
earnest on many campuses during
the 1982-83 academic year, and
have accelerated since as more
states raise their legal drinking ages
and more college towns are cm-
boldened to try to control student
noise. Roughly half the states now

have drinking ages set at 1.]. com-
pared to 20 states a year ago,
Several other “2i states" have also
closed loopholes that allowed
lﬂ-ycar-olds to drink wine and beer.
Arizona and Ohio are cuncntty
considering raising their legal drink-
ing ages to 2i, Bingaman says.
llingaman remains opposcd to the
laws and external controls. "We
fch cducation and cnfotccmcnt of
csisting laws are the answers. not
singling out college students as be-
ing too irresponsible to drink.“
