Tom gets three-year contract

Los Ange/es
(AP) Tommy Lasorda says “1983
was a rewarding year for all of us"
in the Los Angeles Dodgers'
organization. He got‘ an llll-
precedentcd reward Thursday for
his performance this season - a
three-year contract with the club. It
was the ﬁrst multiyear contract ever
given a manager by the O‘Mailcy
family, first tlte latc Walter
O’Malley and now his son. Peter.

Even Walter Alston worked 'his
23 managerial seasons with the
Dodgers under a string of one-year
agreements.

Although the ﬁnancial terms of
Lasorda's new contract were not
announced, it is believed to include
a substantial raise over tlte $250,000
he made this past season.

"Our policy was not set in ce-
ment." said O'Malley of the switch
to a mutitiyear contract for the
manager. "Tommy’s a special, very
talented man.

"He gets along well with the
players. the fans. the media. He's a
gifted individual."

fact that tlte crossbar on the goal
was lower titan regulation size."

The Duties responded with three
second half goals and walked away
with the victory that enabled them
to itnprovc their record to 7-6-l.

Kidder said. "It was a fun game.
We played around with the ball a
little too tnuch. but we did have
some beautiful passing sequences.
We spent the wltolc week on our
shooting, and it paid off for us."

Totnorrow. Albany travels to
Vasaar looking for their third
straight win. Kidder noted that.
"We’re capable of beating them.
but we have to stay healthy."

The Danes are looking forward
to the remainder of the season. Kid-
der feels the “bad things are going
away, and the good things are corn-
ing in." Or as she put it. "the black
cloud has dispersed. and now we'rc
playing good soccer."

THROW-INS: Albany still has an
outside chance for the Slate Cham-
pionship. at St. Lawrence.
November 4-6. The selection corn-
rItiltee will meet, on October 30 to
decide upon the eight
participants...Suturday's SUNYAC
championship game is the filial I983
home tttatch...A win over Vusuur
tomorrow will clinch at least a .500
season for the learn.

Lasordn guided the young and
frequently troubled l983 club to the
National League West title. the
fourth divisional crown in his seven
years at the helm.

Lasorda said the three-year con-
tract wasn't exactly the result of
hard bargaining on his part.

He related: "l walked into
Peter’s office. he said. ‘You did a
great job arid this is what we want
to give you.“ i said, 'Thank you.’

“He made a tremendous offer.
game me a tremendous contract."
“l'm the happiest guy in the world
Just to be coming back to the
Dodgers." added Lasorda. “i was
happy with one-year contracts. If it
was good enough for Walter
Alston. I ﬁgured it was good
enough for me."

Almost every October in recent
years, rumors have surfaced that
Lasorda was considering leaving the
Dodgers to take another job. This
year was no different. and he made
his annual denial that he had been
considering other offers.

"Not true." he said. “l'm stay-

ing with the Dodgers. This is my
home."

Lasorda. 56, ltas spent 34 years in
the Dodger organization, getting
the Los Angeles managing job when
Alston announced his retirement in
l976.

Although the Dodgers lost to
Philadelphia in the NL Champion-
ship Series this year. the job done
by Lasorda may have been his best.

Despite the departure of Steve
Garbey and Ron Cey. the slumps
and defensive problems of the
younger players. and the continuing
woes of top reliever Steve Howe.
Lasorda piloted the Dodgers to a
9i-7l record. best in the league.

"i think l983 was the biggest trial

for Tommy.” said At Campanis.
the Dodger‘s executive vice-
president. "He had a very young
club."
"it was a year where we had some
tough. tough times." said Lasorda.
"We had to overcome a lot of
obstacles. You look at the
youngsters and it was a tremendous
thing they did..."

 

(AP) St. Louis — St. Louis kicker Nell
O'Donoghue missed two field goals
within the last 63 seconds of overtime
Monday night as the Cardinals and New
York Giants battled to a 20-20 National
Football League lie.

The tie was only the seventh in NFL
regular season play since the overtime
procedure was initiated in I974.

The Cardinals' best shot at a victory
came with l:03 left in the game. but a
19-yard fieldgoal attempt by
O‘Donoghue sailed to the right. Forty-
three seconds later. after rookie corner-
back Lionel Washington intercepted a
Giant pass and returned it 25 yards to
the New York 25. O'Donoghue missed
again. this time from 42 yards out.

O'Donoghue had booted a 22-yard
field goal with 54 seconds remaining in
regulation to knot the score and send
the game into overtime.

The Cardinals took the kickol'f to
begin the overtime on their own 19-yard
line. Neil Lomax passed nine yards to
Stump Mitchell for a first down two
plays later. then scrambled 17 yards to
tile New York 47. But the drive died

 

there. and the Cards punted out of

bounds at the Giant it.

Two Jeff Rutledge passes failed to
connect and Rutledge was sacked at the
2. Dave Jennings got on a short punt
and St. Louis took over on the Giants

36.

The Cardinals_ got the ball back on
their own [7 and marched to the New
York 45 on 8- and 16-yard runs by Ran-
dy Love and n i4-yard pass from Lomax
to Love. Lomttx then connected with
Pat Tllley for it more yards to the 34
with 77 seconds left in the overtime.

Roy Green. who earlier in the game
had dropped a pass in the end zone.
caught a 33-yard pass from Lomax and
went out of bounds on the I.

Then O‘Donoghue shanked his short
field goal try.

Giants rookie placeklckcr All Hail-
Sheikh had an opportunity to win the
game in regulation time. But his 66-yard
field goal attempt with six seconds left
in the fourth period fell far short.

Hajl-Sheikh's second field goal of the
game. a 28-yarder with 9:20 left. had
given New York a 20-l7 lead.

The two teams are tied for last place
