Alternate plan by A V rejected

SA seeks $35-40,

Student Association officials are now tak
ing bids for the sale of SA Audio Visual
eqtripment. valued at approximately
SSS-40.000. following a heavily debated
authorization from Central Council Wednes-
day night.

SA-AV manager Chris McCormaek said lie
was not supriscd at Council's 21-0—4 vote to
sell AV. "I don't feel that I lost. 1 think SA
lost. and especially the groups lost." he said.

The SA-AV system. according to SA Con-
troller Adam Barsky. is not used enough to
pay for itself. and is a ﬁnancial drain on SA
because the grotrp often requests new equip-
ment. and ltas consistently overspcnt their
budget. In l98l-82. Barsky noted. AV overs-
pent by more than $20,000 and in 1982-83
they overspent by nearly $10,000. "We (SA)

000 for system

just do not have enough expertise to continue
this (AV)." he asserted.

McCormack proposed to Council an alter-
native plan to selling AV, which he claimed
would not cost SA anything. The alternative
proposal. which had been unanimously voted
down by Council’s ﬁnance committee and
was later voted down by Council as well.
would make AV into a club. with student
technicians working for SA grotrps for free.
The SA groups would pay AV a rental fee for
the use of the equipment. and SA groups
needing audio-visual equipment for an event
would be required to use SA-AV whenever
possible.

McCormack said he would be able to
recruit students to work for free because they
would be gaining experience with AV equip-
ment and they would get to see a show for
free.

Finance Committee Chair Mitch Feig said.
ltowcvcr. that his committee opposed Mc-

Cormack's proposal because they didn't
want to force SA groups to use SA-AV and
because AV workers might give priority to
shows outside of SA because the workers
would be paid for them, but not for SA
events.

Iiarsky argued that McCormack's proposal
was financially unfeasable. and that even if
AV wouldn‘t cost SA anything this year. SA
slrottld still sell it because they "are in a
ﬁnancial crisis." and need the 535-40000 it
could be sold for. He maintained that in a re-
ccttt auditor's report. SA was advised that
they have too rmtch money tied up in tlte
equipment. liarsky called the sale of AV.
“the first step in the right direction."

Woody I’oppcr. who was vice-president
three years ago when AV was established
with a $22,755 appropriation. urged Council
not to sell AV. “I don't tltink that selling the
system because you‘re afraid of going
bankrupt is a good reason for selling it." he
contended. He criticized Council for not lol-
ly examining the issue. “What makes you
think they (problems with AV) can't be
resolved? They haven't been addressed.” he
told Council. He pointed out to Council that
SA-AV was never expected to make tnottey.

Council Votes to accept bids for sale of SA-Av

Graduate opportunities for minorities outlined '

of Alcoholism. Lynn 0. Canton. director of
quality insurance for the State Division for
Youth. and Sam Walton. minority profes-
sional education coordinator for the Ofﬁce
of the Professions. discussed their ex-
periences in graduate school and gave sugges-
tions to the audience.

According to Farrell. SUNYA has 55
graduate programs on campus open to
minorities and offers ttsslstantships utILl

   

LISA SIMMONS Ul’f;

fellowhips that assist qualiﬁed students by
providing ﬁnancial support and a tuition
waiver.

A pamphlet handed out at the session
listed some other ﬁnancial aid programs: a
Graduate Opportunity Tuition Waiver I’m-

rgram. a Graduate and Professional Tuition

Waiver Program for Economically Disadvan-
taged Students. and the Tuition Assistance
Program (TAP).

Davis said that minority students should
identify themselves as such on forms so the)
can be considered for special programs.

According to Walton. a prospective
minority graduate student should apply to
many schools and ask about specific financial
aid programs at each school. Walton also
sttggestcd that students should gain as tnuclt
employment experience as possible and lake
at least one computer science course.

Foo advised the students to use resources
such its the university's (‘tuccr l’ltls‘clllclll Of-
I'icc to see which graduate programs proside
the maximum job potctttial arid which are
beneficial irt the lortg run. “You must link
graduate school witlt at specific ctuccr.” snid

St. Rose lecturer describes ‘Nuclear Culture’

Author Paul Loci) leaned on the podium
before the audience that half filled St.
Joseph's Iinll ill tltc College of Saint Rose
Monday arid told them that "the atomic age
is a tintc that is different that arty other time
itt history."

The sol't»spokcn Loch. the author of
Nilt'lt’fll' (Vt/lure. a study of Hartford.
Washington. home of the world‘s largest
atotttic complex. According to Locb. “We
have now reached a tirrtc where the processes
of ordinary the cart no lorrgct be counted on
to coruitrttc indefinitely. Our world could be
terminated abruptly."

Locb is ttclivc itt denouncing nuclctu war.
studied the residents of Hartford to deter-
minc how working ill the plants that have
manufactured the plutonium tor hull of
Arttcrictt's nuclear weapons. has affected
their lives. What he found. he said. was that
“there is no way the people could address the
implications of their work.

"It was a technical challenge." Loch said.

“The precise nature ot' their work is irrele-
vent."

l.ocb gave some buckgrottrtd on I-Ianford.
explaining that it was founded in I943 ttfter
the area‘s farmers and orchard growers were
evicted by the U.S. Government. The people
who were settled tltcrc were infortncd by the
government that this is a secret project."
l.oeb said. “They couldn't talk to anyone."
ltc said.

This silence. he said. still continues. “They
(lire llnnl'ord plant workers) talk about their

‘spccific job or about who got what pronto-

tiott. bttt tltcy don't talk about tltc product
(radioactive plutonium)." said I ocb.

\tht worried Loeb is that a lot of thc
residents “didn't distinguish between work
done at home (hobbies. etc.) and work done
on the job.

“They deal with tccltnology which can
breed extinction. l'ltis cart destroy ttot ortly
tltc present bttt tltc future." he said. adding
that "they treat this as a normal business."

Locb citcd tlll incident several years ago in
which lie said several engineers from the
plant watched a "Saturday Night Live" skit

'in which n spilled bottle of l’cpsi crctttcs tr

tttrclear accident. "They loved it. They
thought it was great. Then. they went to
work on new reactors the next day." lte snid.

Locb also described a conversation he had
with a director of a reactor used to manufac-
ture pltrtonitnrt. lie was a little surprised to
hear tltc man agree that tile rttore weapons
there were the greater the risk of atomic war.
"i asked him it he favored disarmament."
l.ocb recalled. "and he said ‘I consider
myself a patriot. if we rtced a neutron bomb.
it‘s my job to build it the best that lcan."'

'l'his. according to Loch. pointed out one
of the problems in today's society. "I’coplc
feel that tltcrc is a certain group 01' people
who are so wise that they have the rigltt to
determine whether \vc (tltc human race) go
on." he said. Another attitude that be men»
tiottcd is that “people stty that perhaps tltc
bombs will go off. It doesn't matter. We‘ll
kill ottrsclws ttnywtty."

locb said that he didn't understand why
some people slit ttg their shoulders about this.
“There is a threat ol surrender and cynicism
that runs through this culture." he said. adv

ding the “people just go around saying ‘it's
terrible bttt tltcre's nothing we can do.“'

According to Loeb. something can be
done. “We have two choices. We can trust
those who ‘know best' or we can act
together." he said. adding that either way. it
won't be easy. “\Vlrpn there is a chance to
work for something valuable. it's not
necessarily easy."

"It's going to take something drastic to get
a response frotn the government."_ l.ocb
predicted. “Perhaps a large. unprcccdcntcd
turnout for a rally." he said. adding that “we
can‘t assume ottr political leaders will simply
come around."

The lecture. which drew about 75 people to
thc auditorltnn. was sponsored by (‘SR‘s Stu-
dcrtt Association. Graduate Office. Social
Sciences Division. and littitcd (‘tunpuscs
Against Nttclcar War.

When asked if he felt there was still hope ill
his figlu. Loch responded by saying "there is
always hope trntil hope is extinguished." llc
concltrdcd by saying. "i hope we can do it. I
really do.“
