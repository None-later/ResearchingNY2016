Spurred on by crucial problems
facing tltc nation's educational
system. Dean of SUNYA's School
of Education Robert Koffjoined l7
other deans from similar schools
across the natiort recently in an cf-

Among the universities
represented at the conference were
Columbia University Teacher’s
College, Harvard University,
Berkeley. lndiana, arid the Univer-
sities of Wisconsin and Micitigan
which co-sponsorcd the meeting.

According to Koff. who helped

 

“Who wants to pay $50,000
for schooling. . . and then
make only $14,000?”
—-Robert Koff

 

fort to develop higher teaching
standards.

in a conference held in early Oc-
tober. the deans addressed a range
of issues including the need to at-
tract better qualificd students into
the education field and “make
teaching a learned profcssion."

initiate the conference, "it is hoped
that serious attention to the educa-
tion of teachers by a number of the
nation's leading institutions and
schools of education will result in
other institutions doing likewise."
Koff attributes the major pro-
blems of the education systems to

the fact that fewer academically—
talentcd persons are attracted to
careers in teaching than were at-
tracted decades ago. “The educa-w
tion ﬁeld used to attract more
women and minorities. But now
because of affirmative action. they
can pursue careers that have in
previous years been closed to them.
This is healthy. but it plays havoc
with the education field," said
Koff.

Koff also noted that the low
salaries received by teachers were
another reason there are fewer
education majors. “Who wants to
pay $50,000 for schooling to
become a teacher and then make

- only $14,000? The irony comes

when you teach other children and
prepare them to go to college but
you can’t send your own children
because you don't have the
money."

The rcsuitirtg shortage of teachers
leads to problems of lowered stan-
dards for educational traiuirrg.

Education dean works to create better teachers

This. Koff asserts, leads to
mediocrity in the teacher’s training.

"It is inconsistent for states to
pass tough teaching certification
laws and then grant exceptions
which would permit individuals
|who have not even graduated from
college to teach academic subjects
simply because of teacher shor-
tages. Such a practice merely
pandcrs to mediocrity.” Koff said.

Although the deans are primarily
pleased with the recent media play
education has received since the
Reagan Administration thrust the
subject into the political arena. they
caution against “quick-fix"
answers to education problems.
"Education has becoine a political
issue and will be in the presidential
campaign. But quick-fix programs
which turn unqualified personnel
into teachers in short periods of
time don't work," Koff said.

Koff added that although the ad-
ministration has made education an
issue, “offers from tlte Federal Of-

ﬁce of Management and Budget
have been to cut education severely.
The presidential program includes
prayer in school, tuition tax credits
for private scltooi and the disolving
of schools for education.”

The deans present at the con-
ference endorsed the use of finan-
ciai aid in grants. loansI and
scholarships for outstanding educa-
tion students as well as higher pay
for beginning teachers.

The deans also called on the in-
stitutions represented at the con-
ference to lead the fight irt pro-
viding guidlines for improving
education schools.

The group's goals include the
commilntent to continue to meet.
discuss, and research how to im-
prove the education system of the
nation’s schools of eduction. In
summing up, Koff said. "We see a
problem. we see an opportunity to
think about the problems. and.
.tnder the circumstances. we can be
reasonably successful." lil

Grenada

while a few stopped in Barbados.

U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar
\‘Vcinhet'gcr said in Washington on
Wednesday that the US. toil
aruottg 2.800 Marines anti Army
parrriroopcrs was six dead. 33
wounded and eight missing. Late in
the day, Weinbergcr said scattered
fighting continued against
“diminishing Cuban resistance."

The Cuban governmcttt reported
on its media. however, that the last
resisting Cubans had “sacrificed
themselves for the motherland."

invading forces rrtct “a lot more
resistance than we had expected,"
said Gen. John Vessey .ir..
chariman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. “We had always thought
they had arttts." said Tony Cave. a
spokesman for the Barbados Prime
Minister. “But we didn‘t know to
what extent."

Weinbergcr said American forces
has stumbled across a Cuban head-
quarters. taken a Cuban colonel
prisoner and seized secret
documents and "a large arnorutt of
command and control equipment."
Vesscy said the (.‘ttbttns had auti-
aircrafl weapons, small arms and
machine guns.

With journalists pt't:\‘t.'iilt.'ti by
military commanders from going to
Grenada, all information on the
lighting came from government of-
ficials and radio contact with
American residents.

Until Tuesday, 22-year—old Mark
iiarcttclla had used his radio otin to
call his family each week in
Ridgcficid. N.J.. from St. George's
University Medical School. to chat
and to tell them what he needed in
the way of food and supplies.

lint after [1.5. forces invaded the
island that radio became the outside
world's conduit to ihc‘sccnc of the
fighting. The Atttcrican strident
dcscribed how the multinational in-
,vasion force, including 2,000 U.S.
troops, turned the island's sweeping
beauties and scenic mountains into a
battlefield. '

"Every time a gunship goes over.
there's fire all around us," he
reported, croucltcd under a table in
his dormitory room. '

“We're on the ground. waiting
for the firing to stop. There’s oh-
viously snipers surrounding the en-
tire campus. There are Cobra ships
passing over at this very minute."

With toucltcs of humor he tried
to assure anxious parents that other
students were safe. '

"We're still iroiding here ——

‘machetcs in hand." he said at one

point. Later. he asked for “a ship-
ment of about 4,000 White Castle
hamburgers." l l
