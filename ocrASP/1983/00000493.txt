at Albany County. Anthony Russo.
was also present while his
Democratic opponent. Incumbent
Edward Stack. could not attend.

Russo. a practicing lawyer. had
many Ideas for this position. He
said the fact that he has combined
his campaign with Burgdorf il-
lustrates his belief that "the Comp-
troller should work hand in hand
with the County Executive to assure
the public that fiscal management is
run correctly and that the govern-
ment budget ls being spent In the
most useful way." Russo said that
the “comptroller should act as a
watchdog over proposals concern-
ing ﬁnancial practice and make sure
ﬁnancial transactions made by the
government are in compliance with
the law and for the beneﬁt of the
public." -

Also present at this forum wcrc
candidates for the city legislature in
the tenth and cicvcnth districts.
Sharon Gonsaivcs. the Citizen's
Party candidate for the eleventh
district. said she would address the

concerns of tenants. She said she
will try to Increase tenant rights and
enact legislation for rent control
and stabilization.

Paul Silverstcin. the Republican
and independent candidate for the
tenth district had many proposals
for safety. Among his Ideas was one
'that would get the police out of
their cars and walking the streets.
Silvcrtcin ls opposed to rent con-
trol. Both Paul O'Brien. Oonsalves
opponent and Charles Hil. Silvers-
teln's opponent, were not In atten-
dance.

in the race for Gulldcrlsnd Town
Supervisor. incumbent Republican
Kevin Moss ls being contested by
Democrat Frank Mclfc, both of
whom were In attendance. Moss. a
local lawyer. spoke of his past ac-
complishments such as changes in
zoning laws. setting up
neighborhood watch systems rind
providing more park space since
beginning his term in January of
I982. He was also instrumental in
creating the new Guildcrliind
district 22 which is mostly

.

populated by SUNYA students.
Moss expressed a desire to remain
In ofﬁce to continue to beneﬁt the
town.

Mclfc. who works for the New
York State Division of Youth and
lwho has never held a political ofﬁce
before, said that he "could work
with people for people." Melfc.
who has experience in ad-
ministrative planning and policy,
said that the “town operations
,should be better guided."

Others in attendance included
candidate for Guildcrland Town
Council. Republicans Richard Mur-
ray and John Smirclch (incumbent)
and Democrat incumbent Virginia
Horan. Drive Pyrc. Horan’s runn-
ingmatc. was not in attendance. in
the race for Town Clerk. both
Democrat Joan Byrncs and
Republican incumbent Jane Spr-
inger were in attendance. Ernie Or-
slni. the Democratic candidate for
highway superintendent. is being
opposed by Herb Van liurcn, who

one of her main goals is to work
closely with Council‘s committees.
In addition. slit: said. “I'd like to
become more involved with the Sm-
(lent Voice (SA's newsletter) and
hpr with minority recruitment to
the committees."

Hurwitz. an off-campus
representative, was opposed by off-
ctimpus representative Dave Silk.
Shc defeated him by a vote of
I8-8-2, but it takes a two-thirds of-
firmative vote of the 33 member
Council to elect a vice-chair. Silk
withdrew his name. and Hurwitz.
was elected.

Hurwitz rcplticcd off-campus

OCTOBER 28,1983 El ALBANY STUDENT PRESS 

Democrat, is opposing Ken Riddctt.
a Republican for the position of
Town Justice. Riddett was not In at-
tendance. '

All of the candidates expressed
an Interest In students voting In
Ablnay. Burgdorf said the students
at SUNYA deserved another polling
place and added that it is Important
for the students to vote because
“they are an intellectual and think-
Ing block of voters" and that the
Democratic party has “discouraged
the student vote."

Ring, another vocal supporter of
the student voter. said that
“students are a large block of votes
and can sometimes throw elections

In one way or the other." He men-
tioned that students should also get
Involved In the clctions by getting
active “with speciﬁc campaigns or
attending budget or zoning hearings
tor the like."

The turnout at Tuesday’s forum
was less than anticipated by Schaf-
fer. "I was a little disappointed
with the turnout." he said, adding
that “a lot of it had to do with
publicity and the fact that It was
during midterm week." Scbsffcr
also said that candidates “have
been campaigning here more than
In past years" and that students
may not have found it all that ex-
citing. Cl
