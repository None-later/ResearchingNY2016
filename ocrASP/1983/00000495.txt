"The legitimacy of their request.
plus my own concern for ortr
citizens. dictated my decision." said
Reagan.

Reagan said that itt Lebanon. the
United States "will do everything
we can to ensure that our ntctt are as
safe as possible."

He said there was strong cir—
cumslnntial evidence that the ter-
rorists reponsiblc for the bombing
were tlte same that destroyed the
American cirthassy in lieirut several
tnontlts ago. Iiut ltc didn't indentify
any group.

“Those who directed tltis atrocity
must be dealt justice. they will be."
Reagan vowed.

He said the obvious purpose of
tire attack was to weaken American
rcsohc and force the withdrawal of
Ariicricati arid l-rcnclt troops liont
Lebanon.

“Let me ask those wlto say we
should get out of Lebanon: it' we
were to leave Lebanon now. wltat
message would that send to lltosc
who I‘otnent instability arid ter-
rorism?” ltc said. '

Anti Rcagait also asked:

— "If Ariicrica were to walk ‘iway
from Lebanon. what chance would

there be for a negotiated settlement I

producing a unified. democratic
Lebanon?

« “If we turned our backs on
Lebanon now. wltat would be the
future of Israel'.’

—— “Can the United States or the
free world, for that matter. stand
by and see the Middle Last incor-
porated into the Soviet hloc‘.’ What
of Western I-Itirope's and Japan‘s
depcrtdctice on Middle first oil'.’

—— “Brave yortrig riictt have been
taken front tis. Many Others have
been grievoust wotinded. Are we
to tell them their sacrifice has been
wasted?"

Reagan said that was not the
case. but “We must not strip every
ounce of meaning and purpose
from their courageous sacrifice. If
terrorism and intimidation succeed.
it will be a devastating blow to the
peace process and to Israel's search
for genuine security." he said. “It
won't just be Lebanon sentenced to
a future of chaos."

“We are a nation with global
responsibilities." Reagan added.
“We are not somewhere else in the
world protecting someone else's in-
terests. We are there protecting our
own."

Albany’s Mari Warner: A coach for all seasons

By Perry Tlschler
smrr warren

Site can be seen pacing up and
down the tennis court watching
every serve. return. and volley. or
pacing up and down the sidelines of
the basketball court counting every
foul. rebound, and brisket. She is
Coach Mari Wririier. one of Albany
State's dedicated professionals.

In her third year at Albany,
Coach Warner can sum up her
tenttrc iti one word: “happy.” 'l‘o
lter. happy is ttirniitg around a
stumbling women’s basketball pro~
gram or taking over a losiitg
women's tennis progrnrn and turn-
ing it title a winning one. ller
method is simple: “practice hard.
keep the players happy. rind reap
the benefits."

When the fall season rolled
arotiiid. Coach Bob Lewis. the
men's tciittis team coach. weitt
down with back sttrgery. Summon-
ed to fill the bill was women's tennis
coaclt Jim Serbiilik. This left one
job open. cortclt of the women's
tennis team. When Wartter stepped
in. site ittltcrited a team that went
3-6 the previous season and was in
(life tteed of a coach.

After many hours of practice
every week. the Dane tictwomcit ran
off a string of four consecutive vic-
tories to opcti the season. After the
victories caine a rash of bad
weather. injuries. and the loss of
their number one player. Deb
l.el'fc.

The team began to stumble. witt-
iiiiig only one match out of the next
six to end their season at 5-5.
'l'ltrottghout the ups and downs.
('oach Warner rernairtetl calm.

r reserved. arid kept her philosoplty.

In the end. she was a winner. The
Dane sqttad rallied to the top in the
Division ill State Championship.
placing in the top third. "I was very
happy with our season; the girls just
kept improving." said Warner. As
for her. "it was a new experience
for me arid I hope to continue with
the program next season."

Perhaps the greatest victory iii
her season was the admiration aitd
respect won from ltcr players. Not
bad for a rookie.

When it cotttes lo basketball.
Warner is a seasoned vetertut with
an irttprovirtg program. Itt ltcr first
year. the Dane women cttgers fell to
a sub-.500 record. After an intense
program of recruiting. practicing.
and preparation. (.‘oach Warner‘s
girls ran to it 14-6 record last year
and opetted up a lot of eyes. In her
third campaign. Warner is very eit-
thusiastic. “We are looking real
good. we ltave a lot ol'dcpth with I4
players this year. The girls have
good attittidcs and I think we're in
for it big season."

As for Mari Warner lterself. she
is a rtativc of Maine who was borti.
raised. and schooled there at the
University of Maine. ller life iii the
peaceful country atiitospherc of
Maine seems to contrast the ltard
work site enjoys at SUNY. llei
plans for the future: “I'm just tak-
ing it day by day. I'm real happy at
Alhariy arid I hope to continue the
tennis arid basketball programs next
year.“

The women‘s volleyball couch.
I’at l)wycr. is rapidly approaching
his l5ttth ctireer witi. This is art
aclticvenieitl that would be i
milestone iii arty coaches career.
btit. titotc importantly. his varsity
learn is approaching ttittiorittl ac-
claim of their owrt. l’rcseitlly. they
boast a record that ltris earned tlterri
a number two ranking in the state.
arid the |2th spot iii the NCAA titt-
tiotial rankings.

Last night at Russell Sage Col-
lege. the women ottce again proved
just how impressive lltcy really are.
What was supposed to be a tri-
rttatclt against Union arid Russell
Sage was. in fact. no match. The
spikers allowed only seven points
against tlteiit. while scoring ()0 of

 

their owtt. 'l‘wice. they crushed

and tltcit they completed the sweep
against Russell Sage 15-3 and l5-9.
for tittrnbcr 26. Coach Dwyer' at-
tributed his team's success to their
ability to play together.

I'll tell you." he said. “we are
young. biit well skilled. cotiutiittcd.
.ind very computable. The ladies
.play extremely well togctlter. If We
ltave any weakness in oitr game. I
can't fiitd it —— they cover too well
for one another."

Albany's Rhonda Rogers agrees
with her coaclt. "As far as we are
concerned. everyone is a coil-
tribtitor. We win and lose together.

attd no one takes all the credit. or ‘

hlarne. whatever the case may be.
Rut tltc thing that makes us win
most is tcrutt spirit. ()ur moral is
high. and we are always psyched
because we like playittg together."

This year. they have been playing
together. ritid playing very well.
With a 23-6 record. already they
ltnve accuiiiiihited the best record iii
the history’of women‘s volleyball
here at Albany State. In addition.
the Danes now boast the best Divi-
sion Ill record amongst women's
teams in New York State.

Iivcit iti this sea of success. the
team tttid tltcir coaclt litive been altle
to slay aliortt. "We don't spend
riiticli titttc thinking about anything
except our game. We ltave the talent
to play our garlic tiitd win without
adjusting too much." l)wycr ex-
plained.

This weekend they will play iii a
two-day tournament at liinghrtm-
ton. l)wycr admits. “There will be
some tough teams there; (iciieseo.

nics will challenge tinyone."l l
