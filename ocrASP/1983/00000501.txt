Ian Spelling

In the new movie of the same name. the
clock is turned back to 1947. the year that
Chuck Yeager became the first man to ex-
ceed the ‘unbreakabie' Mach 1 sound bar-
rier. For the next ten years America tried to
conquer the skies. using high speed let
planes. Suddenly. in 1957. the Russians an-
nounced that they launched the Sputnik
satellite into the earth's orbit. The United
States. led by President Eisenhower, refused
to be outdone and declared its Intention of
sending men into space.

 

Chuck Yeager was intended to be one of
those men. but he refused to become a ‘lab
rabblt'. However. many of the other test
pilots were interested in the potential
rewards. in the wake of grueling tests the
field of candidates was reduced to eighteen
men of equal mental and physical capacity.
At long last. the names of the seven men
chosen to be the astronauts oi Project MerA
cury are tirade known to the public. Those
men who represented America in space
were Alan Shepard. Gus (irissom. John
Glenn. Scott Carpenter. Walter Schlrra.
Gordon Cooper. and Donald Slayton 'l'he
deciding factor was their flight record as of
the announcement date. April 9. 195‘)

After two years of trials and tribulations.
testing and preparations. the tlrne had arriv-
ed for the men to put to use the skills they
had been taught On May 5. 196]. Alan
Shepard became the first man in space.
however. neither he nor the second
astronaut. Gus Grissom. reached the earth's
orbit. This task was performed by John
Glenn. Not only (lid he orbit the earth. but
he also had more manual control of the
_spacecraft than either of his predecessors.

The Right Stu/[is a most ambitious movie.
Director and screenwriter Philip Kaufman
has successfully adapted Torn Wolfe's best-
selling novel and brings it to the screen in the
form of a three hour epic.

All of the performances in this film are
above the status quo. The cast includes such
notables as Pulitzer Prize winning playwright

Dennis Quald. Ed Harris. and Barbara Herv
shey. Acting for the first time since being
nominated for an Acadamy Award. as
Loretta Lynn's father in Cool Miner's
Daughter. is musician Levon Helm.

Even in a cast as talented as this one. there
ire several characterizations that stand out.
Sam Shepard is absolutely brilliant as
Yeager. Shepard gives him such intensity
and honesty that his is the character you
recall the most as you leave the theater. He
makes you believe that the now retired
General Yeager should be considered a hero
-“' his own right. if you pay close attention
.\ tcan catch the real Yeager doing a cameo

. Ed Harris is fantastic as John Glenn. Fie
makes his character a true-blue. patriotic
American. a portrayal that will do nothing
but help the real Glenn in his quest for the
Presidency.

One of the difficulties i had with the film
was its disrespectful and cruel treatment of
Vicerpresldenl Lyndon Baines Johnson. He
5 shown to be a completely aslnine man.

This schtick is funny at first. but it continues
to wear thin as the movie progresses.
Another problem is that there was no inter-
mission. Even those enjoying the film found
it hard not to become restless towards the
end. Despite these minor flaws The Right
Stu/[ls a major accomplishment.
