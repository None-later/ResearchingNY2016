[Jo/on Rouge. LA
(CPS) Predominantly-black public
colleges, which three years ago
greeted news-of the first round of
federal education budget cuts and
desegregation decisions witlt warli-
ings tltey might not be able to stir-
vivc. are enjoying significant crrroll-
mcnt increases this fall. ad-
ministrators report.

Southern University added over
500 new students tltis fall at its
Baton Rouge campus, and now has
its second-highest enrollment of all
time.

At Grambling. enrollment has
equalled it 1967 ltigli. and it “could
be the fastest-growing small institu-
tiori of irigiter education ill the
country," President Joseph B.
Johnson boasts.

At Langston University ilt
Oklahoma. enrollment has worried
ilp by a third. Albany State itt
(ieorgia. Delaware State and tile
University of MarylandAi‘asterlt
Shore—ail ptrblic black col-
leges—enjoyed enrollment increases
tllis fall.

"l tltiltk it's quite positive that
otil of our 34 members. l‘) of oilr
institutions either increased their
poplultttion or experienced very
minor decreases,” sa_vs Joyce
l’ayite, head of tile Office of Ad-
vallcelllelit of Public lilack ('ollcges
in Washington. l).('.

A signifi 'ant number of
predolitiitalrtly-wllite public col-
leges. by contrast. has suffered
population declilles this fall.

Enrollment at Kansas' largest
public campuses fell to two percent.
for example. West Virginia. South
Dakota. Michigan State. Alabama.
Bradley. Oklahoma and Kentucky.
among others. also lost students.

Evert sortie fast-growing corti-
lrttlrtity colleges are having trouble.

College’s ertrolitltenl is down fotir
percent. Houston Community Col—
lege's barely stayed even with last
year's.

Overall. the nation's total studcltt
population is supposed to stay at or
near last year's record l2.4 million.
before gradually declining
throughout the rest of tile decade.
according to tire National ('enter
for iiducatioll Statistics..

llttl pllblic black colleges are do-
illg well at the lIlttlllL‘ill.

()bservers attribute the enroll-
llletrt increases to a flight from
utore expensive black schools. to
better “\isibility.” arid men to
desegregation consent decrees.
which black school adrrrilristatots
once uolried \sould time their
students to newly-accessible. larger
ithite schools.

“Some schools didri‘l collie out
well on their (consent decrees). hilt

 

we did. and the result is more
money for enhanced programs and
recruiting." says Clayton Lewis.
corlrlrrunications director at
Southern.

ilut l’ayrie points out “we‘re sce-
irtg growth ilt some states not af—
fected by the (desegregation) suits.
itt Texas. for example. Prairie View
iiltd Texas Southern are doing well
financially, bttt there's been a
decline ill enrollment."

Dillard University. however. has
doite well in combining increased
money with new recruiting. A new
foundation grant. for example. will
establish a new computer sciences

ought to help attract more new
stildents to the cantptis.
"Grarnbiing." spokeslrlan Erllcsl‘
Miles poirtts out. “has bad perhaps
more publicity titan ally other
school in Lousiarla. We've done
four documentaries. We have
(public scrvic‘ announcements) on
tv and radio. And we put a lot ofcf—
fort into high school recruiting. it
all starts adding up in visibility."

The boolti doesn't extend to
private black colleges. however.
There are to percent fewer
freshman at private schools this
year, reports Harriet Scliintel of the

United Negro College Fund in New
York.

"You're looking at the future
with this (declining freshman
enrollment), and it doesn't look
good," she says.

Schimel believes competition
from botlt black and white ptlblic
colleges for top black students may
ltiake the private black college'
dcclirte perntaneltt.

“in sortie slates." she says,
"there's a very fierce recruitment
battle—l wouldn't say battle since
it‘s very one-sided—to get more
black students to go to
(predominantly-white) state
schools."

see iiigiter cdttcatiort "get increases
equal to that of clemelrtary attd
secondary schools—about $200
million a year. it is not an
unreasonable request to do the
