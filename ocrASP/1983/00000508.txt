_ Danes’ improvement Continuesdespite losses

The Albany State football team's
losing streak continued this past
Saturday. but so did their continu-
ing progress.

For the third straight week. the
Danes were beaten in the closing
minutes. this time 22-21. The
Alfred Saxons had the honor. scor-
ing a touchdown with lz2ii remain-
ing and converting the game-
winning two point conversion.

This third straight heartbreaking
defeat saw the Danes sink to a 2-6
record. assuring them of their first
losing season since l976. and only
the second in Great Dane football
history.

The irony of it all is, though
they’ve dropped three straight
games. the Danes are a tnuclt better
football team right now than when
they registered their previous two
victories earlier in the year.

Albany State once again
outplayed and beat their opponents
statistically for three and a Iralf
quarters only to fall apart at the end
as many young teams do.

The Danes had a commanding
2l-7 lead in the third quarter. but it
should‘vc been a lot more. Three
times the Danes had the ball inside
the five-yard line and failed to
score. twice because of fumbles.

With the Danes leading Zl-l4.
midway through the fourth quarter.
they had a golden Opportunity to
put the game out of reaclt. But on
first and goal from the Saxon three.

ed up the football. giving the Sax-
ons the ball.

"We score on any of those three
drives inside the five and it‘s our
football game," said coach Bob
Ford.“The same thing happened
last week. You just can’t win when
you make crucial turnovers in key
situations." .

The Danes had a total of six tur-
novers. Looking at those numbers.
it is hard to believe the Danes lost
by only one point.

To this. credit must be handed to
the resurgence of the Danes' of-
fense. which has completed an
about-face from earlier in the
season.

The ever-improving offense cont-
pilcd a season higlt of 460 yards.
quadrupllng it couple of early
season performances. The 2i points
also is the most scored on the Saxon
defense this year. '

"The offense keeps improving
each week. so you've got to be
Pleased about that." said Ford.
t‘The offensive line especially has
improved considerably."

The team continues to get better
each week because of one simple
reason: they are young. Brit because
of their youth. they are prone to
commit crucial mistakes in pressure
situations, the kinds that lose foot-
ball games.

"With young players it usually
takes two or three good games td
get confidence." said senior
linebacker Eddie Eastman. who
played his final game on University
Field. “With older players it might
take two or three plays."

 

449-7161 ‘

 

Eastman has been an integral
part of the Danes' winning tradition
in his first three years here. and he
sees a lot of promise for the current
team now and for the future:
“Don't count us out yet. There's a
lot of good young talent here on
this club. They‘re going to be win-
ners next year.“

One key to the team's success in
the next two games and the future is
quarterback Mike Milano. In Satur-
day's gante he broke the Dane
records for most passing yardage-
292-and completion-l5. His strong
throwing arm has enabled Ford to

open up his wishbone ground game.

“Ford’s definitely opened up the
offense because of Milano." said
receiver Pete McGrath. who made a
spectacular. acrobatic 38-yard catch
in the first half. “He's a very ac-
curate passer and because of his
quickness he can roll out and throw
on the run which he does so well."

Said Saxon coach Sam Sanders:
“Milatio‘s going to be a thorn in
our sides next year. We just
couldn't contain him today."

Usually tltcre aren’t many good
things to say when a team falls to
2-6. However. this past Saturday
afternoon showed a lot of positives.

There is n friturc itt Albany State
Football. one that looks to be
bright. The Danes haven't played
nearly as bad as their 2-6 record in-
dicatcs.

“I think someone has the horns
on us this season." Milano was say-
ing in the Dunc lockerroom.

Hopefully soon. their youthful
talent canrcplacetheirhorns. l l

Both literally and ﬁguratively. Michael
Miller has stood tail on the Albany State
men's soccer team's back line for the last two
years. At 6’4". he will stand tall wherever he
goes. But it is his desire. hard work. and
sheer talent that has made him stand tall in
the hearts of his coach and his teammates.

“Mike is just an outstanding young man."
commented Albany Head Coach Bill Schief-
fciln. "Aside from being a very talented
defender. he is a totally dedicated, well-liked
kid. Having a kid like that for a son wouldn't
bother me at all."

Scltieffeiin is not the only coach who has
high respect for Miller. This past weekend.
Miller was named by the SUNYAC coaches
to the first team All~Confcrence squad. and
lie was named the SUNYAC East Player of
the year for I983. -

"I had a lot of fun. but I thought we could
have won more games last year and this year.
We had the team. but something just wasn't
right."

Miller has been able to use his height to his
advantage. Being the last line ofdefensc. it is
helpful to be able to sand 6'4” and head
tnany balls away from the Albany ncl. In ad-
ditioit. his long. loplng strides allow him to
cover a great deal of ground. ‘

"Michael was able to cover so much
ground.” Schieffelin noted. "It seemed like
he would take three strides and could run
ltalf the field. I don’t think I ever saw him
lose a footrace.”

But what really nrade Miller such an asset
was his team attitude and constant desire to
give his best.

“I'm the type of player that whatever the
coach tells the to do. I give it my best shot."
Millcrsaid. "We had a lot of youitgcr players
on defense this year. and I tried to be a leader
for them.”

ference says a lot aboui Mike's ability as a
player." Schieffciin said. “It's quite art
honor for him. There’s no one more deserv-
irtg than he is."

Miller transferred to Albany front
Rockland Community College rifter his
sophomore season and has been a powerful
force on defense for the Danes ever sittce.
Although Albany's record has been a disap-
pointing lO-l3-3 in Miller's two years, Ire has
impressed everyone that has seen him on the
soccer ﬁeld.

“When you consider that we ltad five
shutouts this year. Michael's presence on
defense had a lot to do with that. He‘s a
dominating player back there." Schicffelin
said.

Looking back on his two years. Miller said.

This "give it my best shot" attitude has
carried respect from his tcammalcs. who see
Miller as their team leader irt his role as co~
captain.

“Playing with lrirri was great." commented
defender Scott Cohen. a teammate of
Miller's for two years. “I always ltad corr-
l'idcncc that he was there backing me tip. He
taught rtre a lot. and it makes you play harder
seeing him play so hard. When you see him
playing so hard. you don’t want to let him
down or the team down.” In short. Miller is
the type of player that makes everybody else
on his learn a better player.

In addition to being a top-quality soccer
player. Miller is also a top-notch pcrfornrer

During the day. Jim Scrbaiik. is the mild-
mnnncrcd registrar worker who is filing your
drop cards. In the afternoon he turns into

 

 

Strpcrcoach.
Scrbrrlik. a gifted athlete himself. got his
start in coaching through his graduate

ussistaniship at St. Bonaventure. It was then
that he coached diving. guiding two athletes
irt record breaking campaigns. was the assis»
rant swimming coach. taught tennis as ti
physical education class and filmed iltc varsi-
ty baskclhrill games.

Serbirlik is still :1 strong supporter of the
llonnics. As a matter of fact. he plans to go

back this weekend to visit sortie old friends.

Since that time he has taught physical
education at Rocltcstcr‘s Lyndcnvillc Jr.
High. It was tlicrc that Scrbalik piloted the
.lttriior Varsity basketball team to its first
winning season in seven years with a l4-4
record.

He tlrcrt got married. and due to an illness
to his father was forced to rim the family
bowling business. Since he lrad the facility to
practice whenever he wanted he got good
enough to go on the professional bowling
tour. In a span of six to seven months he
crossed the country two times.

- “It's a beautiful country. but that made
me realize that a profesional athlete's life is
overrated." stated the successful coach.

Then the Mcchanicville native got his job
here at SUNYA. He is one of the managers
of the registrar's office. Serbalik. who has a
large appetite for competition, ltas offered
his services to coach any available sport.

This attitude enabled him to coach men's
and women's tennis and diving.

The 'Albany's men's tennis team. which
had a banner season. is the second greatest
accomplishment in his coaching career. next

player irt our conference is a tremedous
tribute to him." Scltieffelln said of Miller.
“When all the other coaches feel the same
way about Irim as I do. well, that says a lot
for him."

CORNER KICKS: In addition to Miller.
midfielder Jeff liackett and forward TIIIIII

Serbalik:
of versatility

to the l.yrtdenvi|le basketball team. His
coaching prowess earned him the title of
SUNYAC Tennis Coach of the Ycrir.in 1983.

.lris squad. “He let the program slip last
scason--we got 35 points in the SUNY/K‘s:
this year tltcy only got 33."

Serbalik has it very simple coaching
philosphy: “If you don’t want to play I don’t
want you.“

The 30-year old coach said that was the key
to tire success of the men's tennis team.
“‘Thcy wanted to play and they wanted to
win. At this stage you can‘t teach players
anymore since tltcy have been playing for
about 10 years. The key is to get them ready
to .play." ,

In the past Scrhnlik has coached AAU
Swimming in the summer. but since he has a
new house in Clifton Park and his wife is
pregnant ite‘will trike at least this summer off.

The successful young coach. who was very
popular with his tennis team. will still not
'consider a full time coaching job because it is,
not economically feasible. But. seeing as Ser-
ballk excels during competition he has no

‘quitlms about filling in wherever he is
needed. D
