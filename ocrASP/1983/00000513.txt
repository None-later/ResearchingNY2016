SUNYA’s DeSole describes Affirmtive Action

By Michelle Busher

In the relaxed atmosphere of
Chapel House's weekly community
supper. Wednesday night the Direc-
tor of Afﬁrmative Action at
SUNYA. Dr. Gloria DeSo‘le. ad-
dressed the group on the goals and
responsibllltes of Afﬁrmative Ae-
tion on campus.

DeSoIe. a member of the English
faculty at SUNYA in the '60s.
began her speech by talking about
the social movements which were
popular during the '605. She feels
the discrimination of many minori-
ty groups. including Blacks.
Hispanics. Asians and females is
still an enormous concern. She
states that “moving these people in-
to the work force is a primary con-
cern of Afﬁrmative Action."

According to Dr. DeSoIe. there is
still an income gap between blacks
and whites and between women and
men. On the average. In jobs that
require roughly the same work.
women make 59 cents to every
dollar tltat a man makes for the
same job. "Minorities are not eligi-
ble for the good jobs." shcclrtlmed.
ttddlng that. "men have not had as

 

much competition as perhaps they
deserve.“

DeSoIe pointed out that even
within the SUNYA faculty only 6
percent of the staff are from
minority groups which includes
Blacks. Hispanics and Asians. while
i3.4 percent are women. Out of 44
department chairs. only 3 of those
are women. she added.

Some of the goals of Afﬁrmative
Action are to get more women
grounds workers and to promote
some of the women who do clean-
ing to janitorial positions. “The
women have the mops and the
buckets. They do the work." she
stated. Affirmative Action’s
general goal is to “change the com-
plexion and add diversity to the in-
stitution." she claimed.

in outlining the functions of the
Affirmative Action office [)eSole
mentioned f0ur major duties. First.
an Afﬁrmative Action plan is writ-
ten which deals with who is there.
who is qualified and who needs to
he considered. Reports are tilled
out dealing with that information.
grievances are handled and new
programs are devised.

One of these programs is the

“Presidential Conference on
Feminism in the Eighties." which is
to be held at SUNYA on November
l2. It will include speakers such as
Sonia Johnson. who will give a
speech entitled. “Feminism in the
80's: Women Changing the
World." Dana Cunningham will
also deliver the address. “Black
Women's Fight for Freedom:
Redefining Feminism." When
asked about the subject of reverse
discrimination. Dr. DeSoIe said “i
don’t believe it goes on." She
claimed that employers may tell an
untruaiifled white man that they are
saving the position for a minority as
an excuse. and then give it to
another white man. She had "never
heard of a position being saved for
a minority." Reverse discrimination
she believes “Is part of the backlash
of social change."

 

 

Dr. [)eSole relayed the positive
achievements of Affirmative Action
to the group. Stating that "the
most important factor contributing
to its success is tlte cooperation of
tile chicl‘ol'the institution"ltcrcat "Thcre has been more success

Alumni elections

Nathaniel Charncy was elected
this past Monday and Tuesday to be
the Alumni Quad representative to
Central Council.

Charncy beat his opponent. Steve
Sinatra. after the first election was
invalidated because the voting
booths had been placed inside the
cafeteria during the original elec-
tion.

The election was bitterly fought
with each side charging the other
with various questionable campaign
tactics. Sinatra had won the ﬁrst
election that was overturned.

No bids on AV

Student Association President
Rich Schafl'cr reported Thursday
that SA has not yet received any
bids for their audio visual equip-
rnent. which council voted to sell
last week.

Schat‘l'cr explained that inventory
lists had been sent to several sound

companies. including Star

Liglttin‘g.and Drome Sound. and
that some companies had expressed
interest.

SA officials said last week that
they hope to get SSS-40.000 for the

‘system which is being sold because

SA ofﬁcials feel it’s a financial
drain on their budget.

Polling problems

.Carribean" states a press release

Some SUNYA students may have .

received postcards from the Board
of Elections directing them to the
wrong polling place. according to
Student Association President Rich
Scbaffer.

Schaffer said he has been work-
ing with the Board of Elelction to
rectify the problem. However. he
added. students will probably not
receive a second postcard to correct
the error.

He instructed students to vote at
whichever polling place SA publici-
Iy has listed for residents itt their
area.

Protest planned

With a slogan “No more Viet-
nam Wars" the November l2
Coalition is hoping that their plann-
cd day of national protest will "be
a major contribution to the growing
movement against U.S. interven-
tion in Central America and the

1from the coalition.

The major focus is a march on
Washington on November 12.
which will feature three major
rallies. Tltc first will be at the head-
quarters of tth immigration and
Naturalization Service. where pro-
testers will form a circle around the
building. The second rally will be at
the Department of Health and
Human Services. and the third at
the State Department. All three
rallies will converge on the White
House and then march to tilt.-
iéllipse in Washington for a pro—
gram of speakers and cultural per~
l'orrncrs.
