Student voting

To the Editor:

Irt u rcccnt opinion lcttcr cntitlcd “Follow tltc Leader."
Patty Suikin urgcs Albany County to follow thc lead of thc
Guildcrland Dcmocrutic candidates. in working with the
students. However. she cites the formation of student
voting district number 22 and the location of the polling
place in SUNYA’s gymnasium rrs bcing the result ofcfforts
by the Democratic candidates. In reality. the Guildcrland
Democratic candidates played a limited role in what was ac-
tually the result of hard work by many parties involved.

Thc (ittildcrland Democrats never once publicly propos-
cd a plan for a student district or polling place. They never
even prckc‘ltlt‘tl the plan to Town Supervisor Moss for tire
liuard ttgcntltt us the letter claim. It was Mikc Conn. S.A.
president at tltc tirtrc and lending studcnt advocate for the
plant. who prcscntcd it to Mr. Moss.

S.A. Attorney. Mark Mishlcr. who rcprcscntcd thc
studctth in this matter. Mikc Corso. and Town Supervisor
Kcvitt Mm should have been consulted with before that
lcttct was written. llrrvirtg not done so. one trttry wondcr —
.lust whcrc did you get your “irtt'tn'tttrrtiun.” I’rrtly'.’ From
the (iuildctltrrtd Democratic (‘ttmprtign Headquarters?

The trbovc ol'i'icittls explained to me that although neither
side originally propmctl the phrtt for (I student district and
polling place. there was cvcntrrtrlly cooperation from both
sides in working “111] (lust) and Mishlcr to get the plan
ptrsscd. lltc Itth is lllill the plan could not Itttvc bcctt [iilbht'tl
“ithotrt lltt.‘ support and approval of the '10th Supervisor.

the letter clarinn that Mr. Moss was “forced” to spill the
district by public prcsstrtc. The formation of new districh
turd the selection of polling places are two scptrrtrtc prov
ccsscs lly ltrtv. pulling plarccx need not be dccitlcd upon un-
til .itriy. l’rrhlic prcsxtrrc concerning the location of the pull-
ing place could only lrtrvc ttriscn trt'lcr tr student district htrd

horrid. the residents of McKttownville did not wish to

Modifications include widened doorways, r1 ramp from
the cabin to tltc outbousc. and a ramp from the front of the
cabin to the porch. These structural changes make for easy
wheelchair accessibility. ‘ I

As the ﬁrst disabled student to take advantage of the
building modifications. 1 found the accomodations to be
more than adequate. The cabin and immediate surroun-
dings were easy to move about in and offered no mobility
problems.

This is one effort that has been made to give disabled '
students the opportunity to experience the same pleasure as
able-bodied students. We would like to express our
gratitude to those Individuals without whom this would not
be possible.

The disabled students organization. University Action
for thc Disabled. will be going to Dippikill soon for another
weekend of camping. We look forward to the experience.
