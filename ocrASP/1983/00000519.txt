two schools the size of SUNYA.
“You're not going to have a suc-
cessful budget when you have a Si .8
billion deﬁcit" Tierney continued.
and he noted that last year “SUNY.
Mental Health and Hygiene. and
CUNY (City University of New
York) were the only ones to get any
rcappropriations in the budget”
from the legislature.

Tierney serves on the SUNY
Board of Trustees. a post that is
concurrent with the job as SASU
President. “I see thyself as tltc stu-
dent representative to the SUNY
llonrd" and that the work is
"challenging — l'm the one student
and often times I'm the only one
with it particular viewpoint."

Tierney has not been without his
critics. hilt he maintains lit: lilies
criticism. since it shows people are
“ill least alive... if somebody gets
angry ill you. you can address the
issue. that's better than not reacting

walking by and into the SA ofﬁce.
Several times he stood up and chat-
ted with friends. advising one to
look into a possible employer's

record of employee concern and
telling another who to get in touch
with at Binghamton's Student
Association.

He added that the ACLU is con-
tinuing with the suit and that the
Supreme Court should be reviewing
the case this fall. Herrick explained
that NYPIRG has ﬁled an amicus

The 5.000 pledge cards were com~
pich by 250 students who attended
the NYPIRG Fall Conference at

Tierney ended the Interview with
his vision of the world today. “Bet-
ween nuclear war, chaos, and the

that he “urges people to activism so
that the train can be stopped before

to work on it.

According to Student Associa-
tion President Rich Schaffcr the
vote was 973 votes in opposition to
the amendment and 520 in favor of
the amendment. He believes people
were confused by the memoran-
dum. "It said something like: Do
you oppose the Solomon Amend-
tncnt?.“ Schitffcr stated. “I tltink
people just read ‘Solunion Amend-
