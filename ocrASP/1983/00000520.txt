SUN YA sees increase in
English academic major;
superior personnel cited

 

By Betsy Eckel

S TAI'F WINTER

 

SUNYA is "bucking the national trend" by having more students
declare English as their major titan in the past. according to Robert
Donovan. Chairman of the English Department. Donovan. who has
been a full time teacher for 30 years. attributes the increase to a
“superior student body and a superior teaching faculty."

While attending conferences with other chairmen of English depart-
ments front colleges around the country. Dortonvan discovered that
mest colleges have had a decline in the number of students declaring
English as their major.

Donovan says that this trend has some unfortunate consequences.
The inccrase has come dttring a time of shrinking resources. According
to Donovan, five teaching positions in the English Department have
been cut in the last eight years.

“We need there mottcy to [tire additional teachers." said Donovan.
Addittg that “Sincc thc cutbacks, class sizes are larger. Each professor
has to teach Ittorc students. This is' a disadvantage because the faculty
doesn't even get to know the students‘ names.

Donovan says that even thouglt English is the third most populttr ma—
jor on campus behind business and psychology. this does not tnean that
it has little value. “Studcnts who take a broad liberal arts program and
then go ittto specialich training go further in their ﬁelds." said
Donovan.

Donovan claims that SUNYA's program in [English prepares students
for all sorts of careers including pttlisltirtg. teaching, editing. govern
Incttt. business. and law. "The potential is unlimited." said Donovan.

Donovan. who got his M./\. in littglislt at tltc University of Chicago
aItd his l’h.l). in English at Washington University, states that the
[English doctoral program at SUNYA has a very high record of place-
Ittcnt. ()Itc cart obtain a Doctor of Arts (l).A.) but not a Ph.l).

Donovan was on the faculty at (‘orttcll for nine ycars and has been at
SUNYA since 1962. licl'orc becoming chairman, ltc tought a wltolc
range of English courses and spccitttilcd irt l9tb cctttttry [English
litcrututc.

"M" duties as chairman include a littlc bit of cvcrythittg," said
Donovan. He is tltc administrator of thc academic programs of thc

- dcpartrttcnt. He makes teaching assignments. manages the dcpartrneut

budch accounts. helps hiIc Itcw professors. attd tries to facilitate the
work oftltc faculty. l l
