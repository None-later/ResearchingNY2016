Reagan foreign policy action stirs discussion

By Jon Wl

STAFF WRITER

Describing the U.S. invasion of
Grenada as a “pilot project for how
we can intervene elsewhere in Cm-
tral America." Political Scientist
Walter Goldstein slated that a ma-
jor war involving the United States
in Nicaragua ls being planned.

Goldsteln is among a number of
professors and students questioned

recently concerning

U.S. involve-

ment in Grenada and Lebanon. »
Goldstein went on to say that

“Reagan needs a personal dramatic

ﬂourish. The cowboy president has

not fulﬁlled the

Marlboro Man im- 

age that brought

him to power. The 
a

invasion t
Grenada is a way to

stating that the U.S.S.R. won't

aribbcan."

Professor Carlos Astlz. a

specialist in South American af-i

fairs. considered the invasion a
"message that is being sent" by the
U.S. to those involved with
Nicaragua. the message being that
we will get involved if we have to.
He further added that the message
may backfire if “Nicaragua sees it
as a threat." Astiz also asserted that
the invasion will be justiﬁed if it
works out. He considered the
possiblin of U.S. involvement in a
war with Nicaragua "doubtful."

Lawrence Wittner, a history pro-
fessor called the U.S. invasion of
Grenada. “An outrageous act of a
bully without sufficient justifica-
tion." He added that the action
"violates international law."
Speaking on the situation in
general. Wittner said “At a time of
nuclear weaponery and potential
for world destruction. it is incredi-
ble that great powers would go on
playing these games."

Students also spoke out on the
current situation. Robin Sardegna
said of Reagan “he doesn't have
very much foresight" adding that
Reagan is not irandling the situation
well and not conveying very mtrclr
credibility. Healso stated that the
reasons for going in were very poor
but now the invasion has been
justified.

Mary Ann Kuryio said of
Reagan's decision “He did what he
had to do because they (the sur-
rounding countries) asked for
help." She went on to say that the
invasion “should have been better
planned."

Bob Touri said “i don't think we
should be the policemen of the
world." He also stated that “An
election year is coming and Reagan
has to do something to prove his

strength... He is trying to keep the
out of the western
hemisphere." he added satirically.

The situation in Lebanon is also a
matter of concern to students and
faculty alike. Hoffman said that the
Marines cannot be taken out im-
mediately because this would prove
that “terrorism pays." He further
stated that “the President has an
unusual idea that we are neutral
peace keepers" while at the same
time we are “actively involving
