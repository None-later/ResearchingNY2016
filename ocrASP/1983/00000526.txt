The SUNYA Student Association
has recently proposed the establish-
ment of a new student fee to be paid
by all graduate students attending
SUNYA.

Student Association. according
to SA Vice-president Jeff Schneider
offers many services useful to
graduate students. but collects i'ccs
only from undergraduate students.
As of now. says Schneider. many
graduate students make use of SA's
services at SA's expense. Without
the fcc. he said. SA will have to
crackdown on the use of these scr-
viccs. As an example. Schneider
pointed to the SA lawyer. Mark
Mishlcr. The legal services provid-
cd by Mishlcr are available to all
undergraduate students at no cost.
Graduate students. Schneider said.
have its much need for the services
Of Mishlcr as undergrads. and thus
should pay a fee.

The proposal. said SA Media
Director Libby Post. needs the ap-
proval of both the administration
and the student body. According to
Post. the proposal has been submit-
ted to the administration for ap-
proval. and if the administration
give its OK. it would be presented to
the students as a referendum.
Assuming both the administration
and the student body Offer their
support. then SA would hope to
hold elections in early December.
Post said.

Approval of the proposal would.
according to Post. result in the
establishment of a separate body
within the SA. called the Graduate
Student Association (GSA). While

.thc GSA would be part of SA. it

would have its own budget and
function as an autonomous group.

Though SUNY at Buffalo has its
own Graudatc Student Association.
completely separate from thc
undergraduate Student Associa-
tion. Post said she does not see this
situation Occuring at SUNYA at
anytime. The idea. snid POst. is that
SA should represent all students.
and provide more and better scr-
viccs for all students but as one
united group.

SA's proposal involves two
issues. according to SA controller
Adam Barsky. First. said Barsky.
“Arc the needs ofgraduatc students
attending SUNYA being met. and
could SA do more to meet those
needs?" Secondly. he said..“Many
grauduatc students already make
use of SA scrviccs without paying
anything for them.

Barsky pointed to campus ﬁlm
groups. the school radio station. in-
tramural athletics. Camp Dippikill.
and international clubs as being
some of the services SA provides
that graduate students make use of.

Barsky agreed with Schneider
with regard to the graduate
studcnts' need for legal services.
“Many graduate students live off
campus. and when signing leases

relevant to graduate students.

The fee, according to Barsky.
would be “very proportional to that

Barsky said he believes that the
administration will be enthusiastic
about the proposal because they
will see how SA could better serve
the needs of graduate students. He
added. however. that the ad-
ministration will probably reserve
its opinion in order to see what kind

such a fee. '
