ought to network more. He advised
papers to cover stories on other
campuses and to run them “to alert
potential yahoos on your campus
that they won't get away with it” if
they try the same thing, he said. “if
you network. get some quotes, and
tie it in, then you will havo a mirror
in which people all across the state
will have to look." chtofi' advis-
ed. He also suggested that. the
stories be played big to attract at-
tentlon.

Another piece of advice that
chtoff had for student papers was
to “get the hell off campus." Hen-
toi'i‘ said that the paper should
"support yourself and the hell with
them." meaning the student assicia-
lions and administrations.

He did say that even though a
paper is funded by a Student
Association. the SA doesn't have
the right to ccnsor or make deci-

sions for the pach "in a public
coilcgc, it's tilc public that givcs lllL‘
funding," be said.

"if you’re on a public campus.
you don‘t have a right to have a

newspaper. but oncc there is a
papcr. thc vcry rcason that it's there
makes it a first amendment forum
to present views," be explained. ad—
ding that "thc state has exceedingly

limited power to say what you can
or can't do."

chtofl‘ said that he felt there
should not be any difference bet-
ween journalists and student jour-
nalists. He advised that a student
reporter should not be afraid to
take risks. “When you're on a
story. you're on a story. Get it and
don’t be worried about pleasing so-
meone like Vice President Poguc."
he advised.

After opening the forum for
questions, chtoff was attacked for
being sexist. Eveline MacDougal, a
staff reporter for Cardinal Points.
the newspaper of SUNY/Piatt-
sburgh, accused chtofi‘ of “sexist
use of language" throughout his
speech. chtoff countered by say-
ing that he doesn't use ail-inclusive
language because it is “awkward.”

Libby Post, media-director for
SA and Iiditor-in-Chicf of thc Slu-
(Icnl V0fl‘i' expressed her opinion on
the matter by saying that “using
lIUlI'SCXlSI languagc is not
awkward. i use it all lllL‘ little from
WIiIing in the Voice to academic
work and l'vc ncvcr hccn critici/cd
i‘or awkward writing." l’nst added
that “His (llcnlol'l's) pcrspcctivc
comes out of rcsisiancc to changing
his way of thinking."

chtofi' addressed the charges by
saying “i know what i want to say
and i say it and that's it." He added
that he's “not going to manicure
my story so that people will ap-
prove." explaining that. “my
responsibility as a journalist is to
write as well as i can and not to
follow cvcry trend to show how it
should sound."

On other issues. chtoft' said
llbcl is the worst punishment for a
newspaper that has done something
wrong. “Libel can put a magazine
or newspaper out of business or
severely cripple it" he explained.
adding that it costs an enormous
amount of money to defend. That's
why. chtoff said, he urges
reporters to turn in stories that are
accurate and complete. "if a story
is accurate but not complete. then
it‘s not true." he said. adding that
“it’s irresponsible if you don't have
complete stories.

chtofi‘ said that the worst part
of free press is that there is no way
to force a newspaper to reply to an
opposing letter to the editor.
"Freedom is not always free for
everyone," he concluded. l i
