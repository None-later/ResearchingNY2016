Random teachers

To the Editor:

1 came to this university in order to obtain the best possi-
ble education that 1 could. Since 1 am here i have come to
talks that the quality of education that i receive is largely
dependent upon the instructors that l have. whether they be
professors or teaching assistants. While choosing my classes
for the upcoming spring semester 1 found that under each
section of Eco 100M no speciﬁc instructor was listcd. but
rather the word ‘stnff‘. Because 1 was concerned about
choosing my instructor 1 callcd the omnomics department.
i figured that they would be able to tell me which sections
the instructor that l desired was teaching. 1 was told that
they did not know who was teaching when. nor would they
have this information until u few weeks before the new
scmcstcr would bcgin. ‘

1 can understand that the instructors may not be decided
upon by the time the course booklets go to the printer. but i
find it unsettling that they are not chosen in time for cariy
registration. The fact that registration resembles a game of
Russian roulette is not very comforting. i feel that
something should dcf‘initly be done to remedy this.

—Laurie Puttemtan

Leadership problems

To tip Editor:

Once again. we the students of SUNY Albnny are being
taken for a ride by our elected leader. Rich Shaffer. i read
with disgust Mr. Schaffcr's comments regarding the UAS
vice presidency in the Nov. 4. 1983 issue of the ASP. Schaf-
fcr's "screening" of candidates was obviously incomplete.
i ﬁnd it appalling that Mr. Schaffcr would even consider
submitting a candidate for the UAS vice presidency who
could not meet with the time commitments necessary for
the job. Mccting uttendnncr: is a crucial aspect of the posi-
tion Schnffcr nominated Ms. LnPortu for. The board of
directors took the right action by not electing Ms. LaPorta.
i fall to see how she could represent the student population
lfshc was not present to vote in their interest. Perhaps Mr.
Schsffcr should have taken more time in his screening of
Ms. LsPorta nnd discusscd time commitments more in
depth.

1 am shocked by Schnffcr's comments regarding Ms. Sar-
racco's leadership abilities. Ms. Sarracco's lcadcrship is not
in question here. Mr. Schnl‘fcr's is. Placing thc blame on
Ms. Sarrucco docs not alter Schnfi‘cr’s nomination ofan in-
appropriate candidate. 1 admire the board of directors who
acted in the best intercst of both student and UAS by
refraining from electing a vice president who could not
:‘ulﬁil the job obligations.

Mr. Schuffcr should take a good look at his own leader-
ship problcms and stop attempting to pass the blame to
students working to better the organization they work for.

~—Lauren J. Walter

Get satisfaction

‘10 the Editor:

As students of this university. we are privileged to have
so many clubs and organizations in which we can get in-
volved. One of these clubs which is relatively new to this
community is Circle K. Although this club is now being
reactivated at SUNY. it has been around for many years
and. in fact. is the largest collegiate organization in the
world.

The main purpose of Circle K is service to our campus
and the community. Thcsc services include fund raising ac-
tivities. activities with children. services for the elderly and
service where needed on the campus.

Although Circle K is a service organization. we still have
fun getting involved with‘ other people. parties. conven-

tions. and most important. a feeling of satisfaction for
what we've done.

Students, we have a lot to offer but we need your input to
make our club successful. Now is the time to get involved in
Circle K. help the campus and community and still have fun
at the same time. We hope to see you at our next meeting
this Wednesday. 7:30 in BA 213.

—Dave Gelctn
President. Circle K

A unique spot

To the Editor:

Kcn Dornbaum. in his critical look at the Gemini Jazz
Cafe entitled “A New Look at Gemini Jazz." has done his
readers a disservice. Gemini Jazz is a unique spot in Albany
that no one who appreciates jazz should miss.

His statement that the food is “. . .usunlly served
lukewarm, but burned or undercooked” makes me
wonder. How many times has he eaten there? If he has
eaten there only once or twice how can he say "usually"? it
he has eaten there many times why docs he keep going
back? Perhaps he has polled many people. but i tend to
doubt that. l have been to Gemini Jazz twice and l have
never had a real dinner. 1 did have a chef’s salad there once
however. and i found it very unusual (containing many dif-
ferent kinds of fruit) and quite good.

Mr. Dornbaum contends that it is overpriced. He cites
$1.75 for domestic beer as evidence. Both times 1 have been
to Gemini Jazz 1 was out on a date. Drinking at a moderate
pace in deference to my companion, I had about six beers:
she had about four. That makes ten beers at $1.75 and a
four dollar tip gives a total of $21.50. Tcn dollars a person
is certainly not out of line for a wonderful evening of good
jnzz. Just entering the door of a New York City jazz Club
can easily run $10.00 per person. The Village Gate is often
as high as $15.00. The Village Vanguard runs at $10.00.

Finally. the staff and the customers are not snobs. 1 am
not a snob. l have never read Dante. l have not seen any
great amount of Picasso. On both visits 1 found the ot-
mosphcrc quite relaxed. My date and i found our way
through many topics of conversation and no one made
"rude and uncalled-for comments."

Right to know

To the Editor:

The staggering fact that New York spends more tax
dollars on non-public education than all other 49 states
combined. and that in New York known figures reveal
dircct aid to non-public schools has jumpcd from $99.3
million to $160.2 million in four years is n fitting concern to
express during American Education Week. Besides visiting
schools. taxpayers should pose some serious questions to
state lowmukcrs. -

—.lohn Luleus

How much public money are we spending on private
education? Since state aid to non-public education often rc-
quircs administrative services and partial funding from
local tax dollars. we have no accurate accounting. Conscr-
vativc estimates for K-12 non-public support approach a
quarter million dollars and. with higher non-public educa-
tion aid. the estimate jumps to $1 billion.

thre and when do we begin to clip this drain on public
resources as we struggle to ﬁnd additional revenue to
reverse educational decline recognized by task forces and
blue ribbon commissions? Before proposing additional
non-public aid or asking taxpayers to support tax increases
to pay for public education improvements. don't they
deserve a full accounting of local. state and federal tax
dollars already being used to subsidize private education?

 

As all?”

Never was the “pubiic's right to know" rule more hp-

private schools at a time when the public can least afford it.

Eating disorders

To the Editor:

On Wednesday. November 16 at 7 pm, Middle Earth in
cooperation with Feminist Alliance and SA will sponsor an
informal presentation on Anorexia and Bulemia. Anorexia
is a threatening endemic signaled by the vigilant pursuit of
control through excess thinness. whereas symptoms
characteristic of Bulcmia arc binge-eating patterns. Since
25 percent of the victims of eating disorders are college age,
1 especially hope that all concerned people in the campus

community will attend.

There is a good chance than you come in contact with
someone suffering from Anorexia or Bulcmln each day.
vlany of these people are reluctant to sack help on their
iwn and may not recognize their disorder. Thus. it is im-
pcrative that the public becomes aware of this potential
fatal situation.

Through presentations by Gail George. psychotherapist.
who deals exclusively with these issues. a nutritionist and
two volunteers who have recovered from each disorder. I
hapc that people will come to a greater understanding of
this relatively new health problem. in addition, we will
learn how to help ourselves or a friend, what kind of
help/treatment is available. and where to find it. There will
also be an opportunity for questions.

Again, i believe this Anorexia/Bulcmia presentation will
be valuable and worthwhile. l urge you to be there.

—Donnn Corwio

Colonialism today

To the Editor:

The Tartuff'tan American concept. of what Latin
America is all about. is one that merits clariﬁcation to those
who see the United States as a poor soul. lost in an ever
changing world. This concept that "democracy" is
threatened by those. who wish to bring equality and justice.
is often perceived as communism. is wrong. This is another
social condition that prevents the people of the United
States from seeing the reality of what is Latin America. The
United States paranoia of Communism. Socialism or any
type of progressive movement. sees them as a threat to its
"interest." The policymakers of the United States never
acknowledge the importance or the interests of the people
who live in oppressive countries like Haiti. El Salvador,
Paraguay and Chile. it is never pointed out that the United
States supports more dictators than any other country in
the world. Many people in the United States blame
everything. that they consider wrong, as being inﬂuenced
by Cuba or Nicaragua. Don't you think that the ingredients
are there for changchthosc who believe that the people
in Latin America are one and they're all alike. may] take a
moment to educate them. There are 31 independent na-
tions. excluding Canada & U.S.. in Latin America. All are
unfairly assembled under the title of Latin America for the
sake of simplicity and commodity. However. when one na-
tion brings change to its people. the U.S. reaction is often
very forceful; instigating Coup d’Etats and creating civil
strife. One very interesting thing about Latin Americans is
that they seem to know just ab0ut everything one needs to
know about the U.S. By this i mean they know U.S.
literature. music. politics etc. Unfonunatcly, one cannot
say the same thing about U.S. citizens or its policymakers.
They know hardly anything about Latin American culture.
1 wondcr how many know who Pablo Neruda. Cesar Valle-
jo. Octavio Paz or Don Jose dc San Martin, Ernesto
Guevara were. The U.S. associates Latin America with
coffee. soccer. kidnappings and military generals. it is this
ignorance that prevents the U.S. from ever attaining the
conﬁdence and trust of Latin Americans. An attempt by
the U.S. to know the people whom they share this part of
thc world with. would inevitably lead to cooperation and
peace.

' The advocates of U.S. policy alwnys point out to the East
(socialist) and West conﬂict, whenever there is change in
Latin Amcrica. 1 would bet that there an: many people to-
day that believe that the Mexican Revolution occurred after
the Russian Revolution. or even believing that Fidel Castro
was a member of the Communist Party- in Cuba before the
victory of 1959. The U.S. .always attacks the governments
who brought positive change to the people of Latin
America. Allende in Chile, Velasco Alvarado in Peru.
Arbcnz in Guatemala. Manley in Jamaica. Somehow the
U.S. ncvcr attacked the governments of Somom in
Nicaragua. Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. nor do they
attack today Strocssner in Paraguay or Duvalicr in Haiti.
Why does the U.S. continue to support oppressive regimes?
in the long run the U.S. will lose. Wake up! it's about time
to put aside the corporate "interest" and take a good look
at the people in the shontytowns of Port-au-Prince, Mexico
City, Sao Paulo. They are the future that will be raised with
the hatred toward Americans.

A philosopher once said. “The profound hypocracy and
inherent barbarism of bourgeois civilization lics unveiled
befor'e our eyes, turning from its home, where it assumes
respectable forms. to the colonies. where it goes naked."
(K. Marx)
