Genesis offers advisement on testicular cancer

Geneer Is the sexuality educational
resource center std/fed by student
volunteers. We are located in
Schuyler Hall, Rm. 104, on Dutch
Quad and work In conjunction with
Middle Earth offering phone and
walk-in information or assistance.
If you have any questions for
Genesis, please drop them off in the
Genesis box in Middle Earth or call
457-8015.

Dear Genesis,

I've been hearing a lot of talk
about testicular cancer recently. can
you tell me more about It?

Basically, there are two types of
testicular cancer (cancer of the
testes), scminomstous and non-
seminomatous. Scminomatous af-
fects older males, whilc non-
scminometous affects more
younger males.

There is a way to test yourself for
testicular cancer. It Is essential that
you examine your testicles regular-
ly. If titcrc arc tiny lumps or swell-
ings consult a urologist innncdiutc-
Iy. Those that have undcsccndcd
testicles urc more pronc to get
testicular cancer. Iic nwnrc that it Is
fatal if no! IIctItcd.

Trcnttucnt l‘or scminomntous
lcsticni cunLcr cnlnils removal of

the cancerous testicle and radiation
therapy. The cure rate Is 90 percent
or higher for scminomatous.

Treatment for I non-
scminomatous also entails removal
Of all the lymph nodes. This type is
more serious in nature.

At SUNYA there is roughly half
a case every two years. This ﬁgure
does not include those that had the
cancer but did not visit the Student
Health Center. While there has
been much publicity of breast self
examinations for women, it-is also
necessary for men to examine their
testicles and breasts, for men have
also been known to get breast
cancer. If you are concerned that
you may have either of these pro-
blems or any other, consult a physi-
cian immediately.

Dear Genesls:

i have thought about going to II
gynecologist but I do not know
what will happen. Could you tell me
about it?

When you go to II gynecologist
you will ﬁrst bc asked about your
medical history and about any pro-
blem that you are having III the pro-
scnt time. Thc doctor or nursc proc-
ticioncr will then check your hunt
and lungs, take your blood

pressure, and take a blood sample
to ﬁnd out If you are anemic (low
blood count).

The doctor will then check your
breasts for any lumps. The next
part Of the exam Is the pelvic exam.
if this is your ﬁrst time. it is a good
Idea to Inform the physician so that
she can explain each step as It hap-
pens, In order to prepare you. A
metal or plastic speculum is placed
in the vagina so the physician can
examine the cervix for any
disorders. A pap smear is taken to
detect signs Of cervical cancer. Cells

are scraped from the cervix
plainlcssly with a scraper or cotton
tipped applicator. The cells are
smeared on a glass slide and tested
by a trained technician. in addition,
the physician may take a gonorrhea
smear in the same way. This Is not
always a routine procedure. yet 80
percent of women with gonorrhea
do not have outward symptoms so
It is Important to ask for this test.
The speculum Is then removed
and the physician does a bimanuai
examination. This Is done so that
the physician can examine the

In addition, the gynecologist will

3 and 6) got 24 percent and Alumni
had a good turnout also,” accor-
ding to SA ofﬁcials.

Guwlcy and the Student Action
Committee organized quad sweeps
to get students to come out and
vote. “We went door to door III the
dorms with lists and we had two
vans cach on Dutch and Colonial
shuttling students" to and from the
polls, snid Crowley.

In the race for Albany City Corn-
ptrollcr. “students supported
Hilary Ring by far over Charles
Hemingway," said anlcy. “This
may be bccttusc III: (Ring) cant-
otligncd extensively on campus," Itc
'said.

Hemingway stutcd Tuesday nigltt
that he believes students may have
supported Ring over him bccausc he
didn't campaign on campus. He
mentioned that be Iikcd to think he
would have been as widely sup-
ported by students if he had started
campaigning wlIcn Ring did, two
and a half months ago.

Hemingway said that he didn't
think students had a large effect on
clcctions. i-Ic asserted that he had
spoken to some downtown
students, who told him that they
planned to vote at home.

He added that he feels most
students know more about issues in
their hometown than in Albany and
should consider voting at home by
absentee ballot. -

“The large voter turnout on State
Quad and at the gym proves that
the students want to take an active
part in the community. If voting is
made accessible," said Schuffcr.

According to Gawlcy, the ﬁgures

released from the Board of Elec-
tions regarding the number of
students registered to vote arc in-
correct. “Thc trut: amount of
registered voters is compich from
the list of the newly registered
voters. Since students move cvcry
year. they must register, and those
who don't are still countcd III the
old address," he cxplaincd.

There wcrc upproxinuttcly 5,000
student votch rcglstcrcd. Including
off-campus students, according to
Schal‘fcr.

“We want to correct all these
problems so that students can vote
curly In April," said Solicitor. “and
the only way we can do that Is I!‘
Kinlcy leaves his position. We want
students to be able to vote without
all those hassles." I'I
