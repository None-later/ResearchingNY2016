Students recall Grenada attack i

(CPS) Jeffrey Hough was scared.
He was away from home and his
new wife back. in Baltimore. Six
days before. he’d seen the evidence
of a bloody coup on the tiny Carri-
bean Island on which he went to
school. He was later to learn the
deposed leader of the island had
been murdered. The new govern-
ment had ordered Hough and his
med school classmates not to leave
campus without permission. and to
be In bed by a new curfew time. It
threatened to shoot violators on
sight.

And on October 25th. the
‘shooting did begin on and around
St. George's Medical School's
Grenada campuses.

The school Itself ls headquartered
In New York, and caters generally
to American students who cannot
get into med schools here. St.
George’s maintains two campuses
on the island. one called True Blue.
the other Grand Ansc. near the
now-famous l0,000-foot airstrip
built by the Ctlbans. Ninety-ﬁve
percent of the students are
American. None expected all inva-
sion for midterms.

But life at the school had "just
seemed to go from bad to worse"
after the coup in which Prime
Minister Maurice Bishop lost Ilis
life. says Tom Fiorctti, anotllcr
American on the campus.

A week after the coup, "the local
government Instituted a martial law
with curfew," he adds. “The order
they issued was very severe. They
said violators would be sllot on
sight. There was a lot of unrest on
the island. As far as the school
went. people were becoming very
seared. scared to the point where
.half tllc school wanted to pack it up
and go Ironic."

Fioretti. who did his
undergraduate work at the Ultvier-

sity of Maryland's main College
Park campus before emigrating to
St. George's. says the med school
faculty decided "to see how things
went" the week of October 24th
before deciding whether to call the
semester off.

Things did look brighter at the
beginning of the week. when the
government lifted the curfew.

“I even went to class Monday
afternoon." Florettl says.

One school administrator was
quoted soon after the invasion
began as saying the worst was over
by then. and that students were
safe.

President Reagan. In his subse-
quent explanation of the American
invasion. said American troops had
uncovered evidence on the Island
that the Grenadian government had
been considering taking the
students as hostages.

Regardless of his safety.
however. Fioretti never got to
return to class after Monday. The
invasion begatl soon theretlfter.
“and everybody's future changed."

Hough was asleep when it began.
awakened by what he thought was
thunder.

"For a minute. I just sat there. I
wasn’t sure If it was just a Grena-
dian drill. but then some heavier
guns opened up. Right after that, I
could hear someone running in the
building who had started banging
on doors. and that's when I ﬁgured
It was something real.

"At that point. a lot of people
were getting up. and coming out to
the hall. A guy announced that it
was indeed an invasion. and that
our government was trying to get us
out, but it wasn't conﬁrmed. But.
he said for sure there was someone
landing on the island."

The students knew it was pro-
bably an American force. which
they‘d seen stationed off the island.
and even watched as a sort of griln
recreation.

Three days before. some of
Hough‘s classmates had even gone
down to the beach to pass the after-
noon watcllillg the U.S vessels go
through lllaneuvers.

Black Solidarity Day

<Front Page

illllttcly l2 years ago by a group of
people ill Manhattan. This group
represented tllc ltccd for equality of
human rights for blacks in society
according to liddie Edwards. Presi-
dctll of Albany State University
Black Alliance (ASUBA).

A lllarcll around campus by
students. designated to start at 12
p.m. had to be cancelled because
otllcr organizations scheduled to
participate did not arrive on little.
“We didn't match because the
other groups didn't arrive." said
Edwards.
