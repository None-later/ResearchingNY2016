A Brien reverse-option pass to Domielly
clicked for 16 yards bitt fell short of the first

the Danes opted to go for it. It titrtied dirt to
be a wise decision as Jones threw to McGrath

8:24 left in the third. The Datics missed the
two point conversion on a dropped pass leav-
ing them 15-6 behind.

The rest of the contest until tltc tinal two

we switched to tire sccotttl defense which in-
serted one tttaii in the lone tiridcrrtcatlt shut-
ting dowtt his short passing game. It worked
rcally well because Ilatctt took longer to
throw since tltc t'ccciici s were covered so our
pass ruin got to hint."

Ford paused and shook his head. "All I
