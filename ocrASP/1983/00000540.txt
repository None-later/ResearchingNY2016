Musician honored

Joel Chadabe, professor of music at
SUNYA. is the recipient of a prestigious|
award from the American Society of Com-
posers. Authors and Publishers (ASCAP)
for the ninth consecutive year. .

ASCAP is the world's largest performing
arts society, offering ﬁnancial encourage-
ment and recognition to members for their
role in American music. Tire awards pro-
gram, begun in 1960. recognizes unique
writers whose compositions may not be suf-
ficiently awarded through normal royalties.
The recipients represent all types of con-
temporary music composition.

According to Hal David. president of
ASCAP, Chadahc's award reﬂects “a coil-
tinuing commitment to assist and cri-
courage writers of serious music."

(.‘lradabc is especially well-known for the
clcclronically produced sounds known as
“new music" or "computer music."

Workshops begin

Off-campus students could save as rrntch
as 30 percent on their heating bills with the
help of energy workshops r‘ccctttly initiated
by the New York Public Interest Research
(irtlttp (NYl’iRG), according to NYl’lRG
officials.

Simple cncrgy savers have been designed
to substantially aid in reducing costs this

of the iincrgy Cost Series. llelpful cncrgy-
cutting tips will be included at the NYPIRG

workshops, held on Wednesday. Thursday
and Friday in LC 3 and LC 4 between it
am. and 2 pm.

in an attempt to learn off campus
students' energy practices, an energy survey
was given to approximately 100 off-campus
students. NYPlRG found that the average
heating bill per month was $55 per person.
Given that the average temperature in each
apartment was 64 degrees during the day
and 6] degrees at night. the $55 a month
was not a bad figure, according to Rott-
man. According to NYPIRG Project Coor-
dinator Paul Herrick. 24 out of 50 students
do not turn down their heat at night, a fact
which also made the $55 a month heating
ﬁgure reasonable.

One measure to cut down monthly
heating costs even more is to seal up drafly
spaces by using plastic sheeting. Only ll
students said they did this, while 44 said
they did not. Weatltcrizing loose-fitting
doors, which tend to lose heat through
cracks around the edges, is another energy-
saver.

All students are invited to attend the
workshops.
