By Stephen Marks

Anorexia Netvosa, according to Gail W. George. M.A..
an eating disorder occurring almost exclusively in white
A females between the ages of 12-25 in middle- and upper-

 

, class families. In an article in the March I982 issue of The

Runner. Sherryl Henry. Jr. described anorexia as “a
Idangcrous psychinctric disorder in which people. the ma-
'jority of whom are women. start dieting and don't stop un-
ttil they are dead."

I George is a local psychotherapist whosc practice dcnls cx-
clusively with nnorcctics and bulcmics. Bulcmln is another
'cnting disorder. affecting people of the same demographic
'group. but which is characterized by rcpcilIL'Ll cztllng hingcs

.followcd by self-induced purging. According to Jane E.
I Brody ill the March 30 New York Times, “victims mny con-
,sumc up to 55.000 calories in an hour or two. then induce

vomiting and repeat tltc behavior Its oftcn 

as four tlntcs a day. Othch take laxntlvcs

—- as many as 300 It wcck — to prcvcnt afth

their bodies from rctaining the enormous 

amounts of food tltcy consume."

Gcorgc will be the principle spcttkcr at an informal
presentation on unorcxiu und hulcmia. sponsored by Mid-
dle Earth in cooperation with chinist Alliance and Stu-
dcnt Association. Wednesday. Novctttbcr 16 from 7-10
pm. in LC23.

According to (icorgc, thc anorectic fcmttlc usually hits nn
nttractivc figurc before she hcgins dicting. Shc is typically
very bright. and docs wcll itt school. chrgc snid. “prior to
dieting. this particular child was considcrcd ‘thc pcrfcct
child. . .ulwttys hclpful. had lots of friends. easy to get
along witlt —— ccrtttittly a child we ttcvcr cxpcctcd to look
like this!’ The dicting child cvcntuully looks so cmttciatcd
that the most common description is 'shc looks like an in-
mutc of u conccntrtttlon czuttp."'

This willful stnrvution sittrts ttt pttbcrty. when the fcmulc
figure begins to “fill out.” ttccording to George. Through
fasting, thc Itttorcxic child halts this dcvclopmcnt. Shc cx-

A 5-15 percent mortality rate from starvation among
anorcxlcs is a generally accepted figure. Pop music star
Karen Carpenter was one such fatal victim of anorexia ner-
vosn. According to People magazine. "an autopsy revealed
no Immediate explanation for her heart failure. But after a
long bout with anorexia. said Dr. Joel Yagcr of U.C.L.A.'s
Eating Disorder Clinic. ‘the most common cause of death is
low scrum potassium. which can cause an irregularity In the
heartbeat)”

There are many theories as to the cause of anorexia.
Gcorgc stated that “she has found a way to break out of
her cnrlicr ‘pcrfcct. doll-like child‘ image. where she never
disagreed or crcntcd any trouble. always doing what others
wnntcd of ltcr. For years now she has had awcsomc control
of herself. She has sccmingly dci'tcd nature‘s most basic
function —— sccking food when hungry. She has attained
mastery of her cravings for food, comfort. intimacy. She is
uniquc. She feels spccittl. ‘

I Another widely supported theory suggests that women
hccomc nnorcxic through socittl cmphztsis on sllmttcss and
thc Villuc placed on the “idcttl” female figure. Judy Miller
of Feminist Alliuncc ttgrccs with this thcory. "Tltcrc is at
stttndttrd ol' hcttuty for wotncn in socicty. Women scc being
thin as ittl indirch Itcccss to power through tltc npproval of
mctt in powcr positions." shc said.

Associated Disorders.

Dr. Craig Johnson. director of an eating disorder pro-
gram at Michael Recs: Hospital in Chicago. estimates that
up to 20 percent of the The criteria. as outlined by Patricia
A. Newman and Patricia A. Halvcrson in their book
Anorexia and Bulemia.‘ A Handbook for Counselors and
Therapists. includes:

—rccurrent episodes of binge eating.

~—consumptlon of high-caloric food during a hinge.

—lnconsplcuous eating during a bingo.

—tcrmination of hinges by abdominal pain. sleep. or
self-induced votttitlng.

—rcpcatcd attempts to lose weight through vomiting or
use of dlurctics. and

—frcqucnt wcight fluctuations (greater than ten pounds)
due to nltcrnnting binch and lasts.

The most frequent agc of onset for bulcmia is 18 years.
when signiﬁcant lifc decisions and transitions are taking
place. Bulcntia is also brought on by feelings of low self-
esteem. luck of coping skills in strcssful sltuntlons. and like
ttnorcxlu. by social obsession with slimncss and dieting.

The key to effective trcatmcnt of botlt anorexia and
bulcmin lies in curly dctcction. followed immediately by
prufcssional attention. If tltc pattern of fasting is not
changcd curly. tlIc victitn of on eating disorder may con-
tinue ltcr life-threatening starvation behavior throughout
ltcr llfc.

Aftcr It complete physical has been pcrformcd. a
diagnoscd tanfL'L‘IlC or bulcmic may nccd to be hospitalized
in order to dcvclop a Mile, life-sustaining wcight. According
to Gcorgc. only tltcn ciltt psychotherapy be effective.

"My own IrcIttmcnt ttppronch is through individual scs-
slons contbincd with frequent family sessions. based on a
titnc limited. goal-oriented contract drawn up by the
illlOrccllL'. llL‘r fntttily and myself after tltc initial session.
The scssions ttrc cxpcrintcntnl, with assigned tasks bctwccn
