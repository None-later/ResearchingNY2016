By KEITH MAR_DER

Associate Sports [ditor

A bystander at a recent Albany State men's basketball
practice noted, "i heard a rumor that Dave Adam is going
to hit the rim on one of his jumpshots today.”

The bystander continued. "You see this drill where they
shoot around the perimeteri The other day he made 14 out
of 18, and today he made 12 out of 15. This guy is
amazing.” In short, Dave Adam is the ideal shooting guard,
and the Danes will look to him for leadership both on and
off the court in the 1963-84 season.

Adam recently showed off his awesome shooting pro-
wess in the November 4 Purple-White intrasquad scrim-
mage. He shot seven out of 10 from the floor and ﬁnished
with 17 points. It is this kind ofproduction that is expected

- out of Adam regularly this year.

Last year, Adam averaged 6.5 points per game on 46.8
ﬁeld goal shooting in his role as sometimes starter,
sometimes reserve. He also shot a very solid 73.2 percent
from the foul line. This year he is strictly In a starting role
and is expected to produce in a big way.

Adam was tabbed co-captain oi the team along with for-
ward Wilson Thomas. These two will have their hands full
trying to replace last year’s captains, John Diockulman and
Mike Gatto.

Dieckelman was not only the statistical leader of the
Danes in almost every area, but hr.- illSO had that rare per-
sonality to lead a team through thick and thin.

One or two players will not be enough to pick up the
slack of such a superstar.

“All of the guys who were here last year have grown up a
lot. We're all going to have to be pretty much loaders,"
Adam said.

In addition to his leadership role, he will be counted on
for a lot of ofit-nw (luv to the loss of Diuckulinan and Culi-
it).

"Lost your you could Just sit out their: and just food the
ball to John (l)ivtkt-liimn) and John was L‘llht'l’ going to
scorc- or got fouli'd. The guys thiit are playing there now are
plyaing well, but they’re not going be il ID. This means the
guards are going to have to score mow and I‘m going to
haw to scorc- iiioiu,”Ad.im says.

"Davi- is the best shootL-r Wt? havv, Wt‘ will need at least
15 shots .1 gami- out of him to be successful this ytutr,"
commented Albany Head Coach Dick Sauurs.

"I think he’s got .i lot more confidence in his shooting
than when hv started two years ago, and he should haw a
good your,” Sauvrs said,

Adam ilovsn't we .iny problems with adding mom to tho
tuam’s ()ilt‘llst’.

"llu'ri- wr‘rv limos lost your when Doc iSauurs) used to
get mad at mt- when I didn't shoot, i worked hard ovvr the
summer on my shooting and now I have a lot of con-
fidence in it," said Adam, who then stated, “Doc has con-
fidentv in me, so I'm going to tiikc- the shot."

Last season Adam gi'nortllly came off illt.‘ bunch for ins-

l . , .
taut offense. This St'dhim he has been thrust into an entirely

different role. Now Adam is. starting .it guard opposite Dan
(frontier.

"We work wvll together. If I make a mistake he covers
for run and vice versa. Each of us knows what the other one
is going to do," said Adam.

Without the big guy in the middle the Danes will be wt-
per ml to push the ball up court and look for the fast-brook
.i lot more than in the past.

"Mo, Jan, rind Danny all like to run more. Last year J.D.
was one of the big cogs in the offense so you wanted to
wait for him to gt‘l down. But, now we have .1 lot of guys
who can ’St(lit‘; wv'ro not just looking for one guy,"
pointvd out tlw Niskayuna native.

Sam-rs will take advantage of Adam’s vvrstility by having
him play both lllt‘ point guard and the shooting guard posi-
tions.

"l h- iAdamJ will son a. lot of time .it both guard
positions." said Sauurs.

"I would rathnr play the 2 (shooting guard). but I have

‘ Dave Adam: shooting guard

just as much confidence in playing 1 (point guard),” said
Adam, who also added, "1 don’t think i can run the break
as well as Danny. He’s a phenomenal passer. But, once we
get into a half-court offense I think I can run it as well as he
can."

As far as predicting the team’s success this year, Adam is
very optimistic.

"'I think we have a chance to be very, very good. i know
last year there were a lot of times when the guards could
outplay us. That was one of the main reasons we lost
games. I think there are going to be very few games when
the guards get outplayed this year."

There is nothing more stimulating to athletes than a loud
home crowd that Is in their favor. Being that the Danes will
be a running team, they will be an exciting team that will
keep a crowd on Its feet. Adam hopes that this will renew
fan interest in the team.

"One thing I hope we get this year are the crowds. It’s a
lot more fun playing when people are yelling for you,“ the
captain said.

Adam's most productive game scoring-wise last year was
in a 79-75 road loss to Cortland where he popped in 16
points. Again, this is hoped to be a routine sort of game for
him his year.

Adam, who stands 5’10”, sat out his freshman season
with an illness and he was redshined before returning to
.action two years ago. Thus, even though this is his fourth
year at school he is a junior and has one year of eligibility
left after this season, This is good news for Great Dane fans
and coaches.

Watching Adam ill .in Albany practice is like watching an
lriihl at work. l'lt.’ usually arrives at practice early, where he
shoots about 50 shots .1 day on his own before the regular
portion of practice begins. This is where Adam is at his
best. Shooting is his masterpiece, and his textbook form
and grace make his shooting a sight to see. It’s almost as if
you’re watching a machine. Head lake, dribble to the
right, shot, swish. Head fake, dribble to the left, shot,
swish. if you were to look in the encyclopedia under
“Basketball Shooting," you just might see Adam’s picture.

When regular practice begins, things are generally no dif-
ferent. Whether it be a shooting drill, foul shooting practice
or a scrimmage, Adam wears out the nets.

Even his Ieamin itvs marvel at Adam’s extraordinary
shooting touch. 1? woody at a practice the varsity was
scrimmaging against the junior varsity, and Adam was up
to his old tricks. He hit three bombs in a row, prompting
teammates JJ Jones and Adam Ursprung to turn around and
chucho in awe. "This guy doesn’t miss,” Jones said, with
only the slightest bit of exaggerationAdam‘s three
l1()Wlll(‘fS promptch Sauers to stop practice and scold the
defense, “Can't you guys tell that hi: can shoot yeti”
Sauurs yelled. Adam went on to miss one shot, then hit
.inothvr one from downtown before being removed from
the game. His teammates congratulated him for his fine
four out of five performance. He thanked them and stared
back on tlw floor, suumliigly embarassed. For Dave Adam,
it was just anothvr day at the ofﬁce. [:1
