The Women

By PERRY TISCHLER
Sports WlIlt'I

In 108], the Albany State women’s basketball team stumbled to a disappoin.
ting 7-l2 record. In 1982, rookie coach Mari Warner led the Danes l() a 14—6
record and a lOih place ranking in the state. It's now 1983 and the new edition
of Coach Warner’s squad looks better than ever.

This year's team features nine returning members and four newcomers.
However, the four newcomers must help replace the four starters from last
year’s team. The losses of forward Nancy Wunderlich, seniors Robin Gibson
and Rhea Edwards will be tough ones to overcome. Wunderlich led the Danes
in scoring (13ppg) and rebounding (6.2) last season, Gibson, although
hampered by injury, averaged 11.3 points per game and 4.4 rebounds per
game. Edwards was a catalyst on defense with her quickness.

loading the team this year are co-captains Peg Squazzo and Veronica Patter-
son. Squazzo is a 5’8" senior from lrvington who will be at forward. Patterson,
a 5’4“ junior from Syracuse, averaged 7.5 points per game and 4.8 rebounds
per game in the 1982-83 season.

Joining Patterson in the backcourt will be starting point guard Wilhelmena
Lesano. Lcsane, a 5'2" sophomore from the Bronx, averaged i0.S points per
game in her freshman season. Coming off the bench to back up Lesane will be
Debra Logan, a 5’4“ sophomore, who in Coach Warner’s words “has really
come a long way." Rounding out the quartet of hardwood quarterbacks i5
Debra Pardow, a 5'5” sophomore from Manhattan.

Banging down low this season with Squazzo will his sophomore forward
Diane Ft'rnandcs. 'l'lw 5’7” Staten Island native averaged 5.5 points per game
and 2}) rebounds pt‘r game last year. Also playing down low this season will be
5’7” junior Chris Cannata from Port Jefferson, S’lO” freshman Kim Kosalek
from Tully, and 5'8" junior Meme Cappcllctii of East Syracuse. Cappelleiti is a
quick developer who can play both forward and guard. Other versatile pur-
formers include Loren Coleman, a 5'8" Bronx freshman who can play both
guard and forward, 21 Jean Pollock, a 5’10” sophomore from Rouses Point who
plays forward and backup center. Freshman Barb Shlpley Will also come off the‘
bench to help the Dane cause.

Patrolling the middle will be veteran center Nancy Grasso. Grasso, a 5'11"
junior from Yorktown, threw down 4.9 points per game while grabbing 2.9 re-
bounds per game in her sophomore campaign. "One ofthe keys this year Will
be how aggressive our forwards and centers play," commented Warner.

it may well be known as The Year of the Guards. '

When the l983-84 version of the Albany State men's basketball team takes
the floor for their opening game of the year Friday night against CCNY in the
first round of the Capital District Tournament, gone will be the services of two
of their key frontcourt players in recent years. But returning are two mature,
experienced guards, and a good deal of depth in the frontcourt that may pro-
vide more balance than in the past.

Center john Dieckclman and forward Mike Gatto were lost to graduation last
May, The two combined to average close to 28 points and 16 rebounds 0 game
last year. But while last year’s strength was up front, the talk this year centers
around the guards, junior co-captain Dave Adam at shooting guard and junior
point guard Danny Croutier.

"i think the biggest plus we have,“ commented Albany Head Coach Dick
Sauers, "is experience in our backcourt.”

Croutier unit-r5 his third year as a starter as a much more mature, confident
player than he was when he stopped in as an inexperienced freshman two
years ago.

“Danny has guiltrn more under (()l1li’()l each year that he’s played," Sauers
said. "He‘s more of a leader now than he was last year at this time, and I think
he knows that be has a big role out there."

The role Croutittr has as a point guard has to do with setting the tempo of the
game and controlling the Albany offense. Clearly, it is integral for Croutier to
have a big year if the Danes are going to improve on last year’s 17-10 record.

"last year, \Vt‘ had more experience in the frontcourt," Croutier noted.
" this your, we have experience in the backcourt. I don’t feel more pressure. I
think wu'rt- going to btht more scoring in the backcourt. ()n the court, it's g0-
ing it) l)(‘ mo and l).lV(‘ (Adam) st'liing iltt.‘ flow."

(frouiicr averaged 11.2 points per game last your, second only to
Him kultnan‘s I7. I. Iiis H4 assists 15.3 per game) easily led the team, and this
is one of Cr'ottiit-t"s bust asst-ts.

"Danny's a plwnomt-nal passer," Adam said. "He can find the open man.”

Adam returns ltlt’ his strctmtl year at the off-guard position. He averaged 6.5
points per game last year, but with his deadly shooting much he has got to be

"Nancy (Grasso). Jt'ttn (Pollock), and Kim (Kosalek) will have to get tough
under there,” _

The team as a whole is in top physical shape for the season, A conditioning
class that started in September has enabled Coach Warner and Assistant Coach
Patti Becker to work more on their actual game. This year's team will feature a
run-and-gun offense that will highlight quickness and a trapping defense.
Coach Warner elaborates, "Our lack of height won't permit us to work inside
too much. We'll have to rely on our quickness. it will put a lot of ballhandling
pressure on our guards but I think they can handle it.”

This season the Great Danes will playing in the SUNYAC, a league of 1]
teams with five in the eastern division, and six in the western division (lnly the
