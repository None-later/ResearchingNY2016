Superpower nuclear weapons
strategies are subject of debate

By Caryn Mlske

Opposing .views on the nuclear
question were discussed at a
Speakers Forum November IS. The
effects of nuclear war. tlte disarma-
ment question. and the identity ofa
possible leader in,rlte arms race
were among the topics touched
upon in the debate.

Retired Air Force Colonel and
expert on high teclt U.S.S.R. in-
telligencc, Raymond Sleeper. and
Dr. Katie Henrikson. a medical
researcher and member of Physi-
cians for Social Responsibility.
debated the problems and possible
effects of nuclear war.

\Henrikson explained the
disastcrous effects of a nuclear ex-
plosion. A one rnegaton bomb.
which is not considered large by
tnodcrtt standards. would obliterate
98 percent of tire population witltiri
one and three quarter miles of int-
pact imrnediaiely by fire storms arid
lethal radioactivity. she said. l-‘ivc
tnilcs from the blast. 50 percent of
the population would die. site said.
in order to be safe front the illl~
mediate effects an indi\ idual would
ltave to be at least IS~20 ntilcsaisay.
according to llenrikson.

The secondary ett'ccts of a
nuclear blast are just as detrimen-
tal, Henrikson noted. the
destroyed materials turn into dust.
which then corttposcs a radioactive
mushroom cloud. Seventy percent
of the fallout from this cloud lalls
close to the bombed site. However.
30 percent spreads and falls later.
covering 400 square rrtiles with
radiation. A food shortage would
then ensue since botlt loud and
water would be contaminated. if a

general nuclear war occurred. com-
munication and distribution
systems would disintegrate. she
said. Those lucky enough to survive
tltc blast would probably ITL‘L‘IC or
starve to death, according to
llenrikson.

There has also been sortie conjec-
ture. by people like Carl Sagan. that
dust storms would block the
sunlight, causing the tcrtiperattirc to
pittttimct to I] below. llenriksoti
said. This is merely the effect of one
bomb: the effects of an all ottt
nuclear war are incalculable. site
noted.

Henrikson claimed that the
Soviets are not ahead of the
Americans in the arms race.
America has tttorc subs and small
accurate weapons. she said. httt the
Soviet Union ltas triorc latid based
weapons and arms which are larger
but less accurate. " i‘lierc ate
enough missiles to hit ctery possible
object at least l5 titties. And once a
target is hit. it's unnecessary to liit ll
again." llcririksonaaid.

Sleeper espresscd a different
point of view. He stated. "the Rus-
sians are ahead of us technological-
ly. having lch titrtcs the throw
weight ottr bombs do."

"The arms race is motivated by
the need people hate to feel
secure." said llcnrikson. “Nations
try to acctittitilatc the biggest and
best weapons they cart afford to
protect national security. After a
certain point. however. this method
of security becomes dangerous, site
said. The best way to intprote otrr
security now is by reducing ratltcr
than increasing our arms." she add-
ed.

llenriksott said site bclietcs that

successful treaties with the Russians
are possible. She added that a com-
nton ground can be reached. and
the Russians will abide by the treaty
because it serves their own self in-
terest, “We shouldn't expect their
friendship or a change in national
character." said Henrikson. The
treaties can be verified by ottr
satellites and planes. she said.
Hertrikson added that it's doubtful
that the Russians could upgrade or
develop ttew weapons without our
knowledge. What the Soviet Union
would gain by cheating is not worth
the risk to tlterti. llenrikson ex-
plaincd.

Sorric of these points
disputed by Sleeper. He said that
the Russians cannot be trusted to
adhere to any treaty. “There is tto
\Ht) for its to \eril‘y whether the
Russians adhere to a treaty," said
Sleeper, "Detailed photos of missile
silos provide us with no informa-
lloit of what's inside the silo." ltc
said. According to Sleeper the Rus-
sians have violated the SALT i new
ty 72 times.

“Since there is no trcatttietit after
a nuclear war we trtttst work for
prevention. mostly through pttblic
opinion." llclltllsstm declared. The
US. should pledge not to use
nuclear weapons lirsl. as ill" Soviets
already have. arid there should be a
tree/e and reduction of rittclcar
arms. according to llcnrikson.
Lastly, there should be a change in
attitude toward the Russians. she
said. “Although we don‘t agree
\\Illl their system. we tttirst corti-
protttise with them in order to stir-
sitc because they aren't goittg to go
away." llenrikson obsericd.

Sleeper said ltc doubts the stir-

This year Edwards promised that

the coordination of events,” be ex-
plained.

This year Edwards said he will
leave everything possible up to each

that it's just too tttticlt for one per-

Edwards said time is a major fac-
tor. All the students. including
himself. involved in planning an
event could not always put as much
time as they would like into it
because they had to put effort into
class work as well.

One thing Edwards would like to
see is a calendar for Black History
Month made up in coordination
with the black and latin organiza-
tions on other area campuses such
as Sicna and Rensselaer Polytechnic
institute. .

The recent formation of a
SUNYA chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement
of Colored People (NAACP) has
helped to expand ASUBA's in-
volvement with political issues. Ed-
wards said.

"Working with NAACP we
realizc we have to put some ctiergy
into recruiting tninority students to
tire University." he said.

Edwards also mentioned that lie
was workiitg with the Student
Association's Minoritv Affairs

because he could not contribute the

He did say however that ASUBA

and that they share the same ofﬁce.
Edwards invited NAACP to use the

enough room."

"Our goals are pretty much the
