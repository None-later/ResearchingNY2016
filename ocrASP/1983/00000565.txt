Appalachian trip

' the effects of lower demand are

those who can afford it least -— the
poor in Appalachia.

The reasons the students made
the trip varied with each individual.
Jul all expressed a desire to set: one
of America's sub-cultures. They
also saw the trip as an opportunity
to do service work with the poor.

All found the trip a success. as
Johnston expressed it, "What
sntisficd me most was knowing that
I mode :1 diffcrcncc in their lives for
IllL‘ wcck l was thcrc."

Bonctli summcd It up for
cvcryonc when she said “I feel it's

 

very important to have an ex-
perience of a poverty culture." She
also said it was a good trip because
she learned a little bit about what It
was like to be a missionary. The
fact that “the students got a chance
to learn about living in a Christian
community" was also very impor-
tant. she added.

Other students who made the trip
wcrc Jcannc Towcr. Steve Modicn.
and Angola Lambruso. Tower is
spending the semester in England.
Modica graduated in June. and
Lambrnso could not lilllkl.‘ ii to

said .Merdcr. escorts are up-
proechlng the women and asking if
they want to be escorted.

The nightly program In divided
into two shifts. 8:l5-l0:00 p.m. and
i0:00-12:00 p.m. There is one coor-

dinator at each escort sight and the ‘

coodinator has eight escorts per
location.

According to Aucr. escorts can
be identiﬁed by a special sticker on
their ID. Escorts always consist of
two people. one or both of which
are female and In the future they
hope to have some kind of visual
identiﬁcation such as a hat or coat.

Ed Grecnbcrg. another student
escort. said "Women's safety is a
very Important Issue that should be
taken seriously." He added that "I
personally would go out of my way
if I know it would help someone In
need." ' fl

bcforc new employees can be hired

A third party will hour the
grievance. and will then make a

two workers.

Slcvcns stressed that it's not the
post office’s decision to have this
disservice occur. The matter will be
handled as soon as possible. Stevens
maintained. The cases have not
been scheduled yet. he said adding
that. “The issue can only be settled
