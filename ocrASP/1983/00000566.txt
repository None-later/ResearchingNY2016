Alternatives to prison
sentences examined at '
statewide conference

By Lisa Mirabella
5M] I‘ ll'RIiER

_,_..___..——_
Tlte criminal justice system came
under the serritiny of 200 law en-
forcement officials. correction anti
parole ofﬁcers and representatives
of private counseling agencies at an
“Alternatives to incarceration"
conference on Wednesday.

Keynote speaker Mark Corrigan.
Director of the National lrtstittrte
for Sentencing Alternatives. said
“()vercrowded jails are symptoms
of a completely overcrowded
critttittal justice system."

However. overcrowded jails are
not lite only reason authorities are
st‘iilL'ililIg for alternatives to keep-
irtg convicts inside prison \\ttiis,
William McMahon. l)e|utl_\ ('orit-
itrissiorter of the NY State |)i\isitttt

-of Criminal Justice Serriccs told the

crowd. "i firmly believe Mario
(‘iroitto is interested itt tiltetlittlhes
becatrse that's wltat Ire believes itt.
it's his philosophy."

McMahon was recently ap»
poirtted to the State Alternatives to
incarceration Task l’otce by (ii)\‘L‘i‘-
trot (‘uottto. 'l'he l‘ask Force was
Iorrtted last year and started “illt a
$4.5 iitiiiiott budget to initiate
specific progrartts for convicts serv-
ing itr state or cotittty prisons.

\V. Douglas Cali. Sheriff oi
(icrtescc Cotritty. shared tlte details
of his (‘ottrtttiinity Service/Restitu-
iiort Program tvitlt the conference
participants. He said the 307 people
ttiro ltavc been involved iii the pro-
grartt itt tlte last year have done
25.000 hours of work that is north
over 315.000 to tire cottrrttrruity.

“People don‘t want these of-
fender's irt their cornrittrnity," \iliti
.\lattirr lloirt. Assislitlti ('ortrntis-
siorier of the NY State Depattrtterrt
ol (‘ort'ecliortrtl Seniccs. llc stress-
ed that there rtirist be a strong corn»
iitittncrtt to art altcrrtatitc program
.. “or it will erode ill the face of
opposiiott."

Sheriff Call said he did rtot have
opposition to (lettesec t.‘otnrt_v's
program. “i ran on that (the pro-
gram) as part of my platform." he
said. “and i was just re—electcd last
week."

(Torrigan suggested the communi-
ty benefits much more from various
community services and rehabilita-
tiott programs lltatt frottt keeping
all convicts irt jail. “ the unbound-
ty doesn‘t learn from someone go-
ing to jail after the story is otrt of
tire media. With corrttntntiry based
penalties the corttnrnrtity secs wltrtt
ltappens (to the ot'l'endert."

Avoidance of costs for the corn-
tttunity was also on Corrigan‘s list
of benefits secured by alternative
programs. "There's redtrced
maintcrtanee of offenders. valuable
services rctidercd. arid we cart often
avoid costs on capital investtttent
construction." Corrigan said that
the cotttrtitrtrity also benefits from a
program tltat brings a cottvict back
irtto the society iii a productive ttnd
positive way.

Richard MacDonald of the
('apital District Regional Planning
Conference, and a conference
