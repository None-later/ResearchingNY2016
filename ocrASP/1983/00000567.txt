NOVEMBER [8,1983 ti ALBANYSTUDENTPRESé‘ 

 

Phone direCtory due

By Suzanne Murphy

After a delay of about two and a half weeks, the Albany Student
Directory is expected to come otrt November 22nd. the day before
Thanksgiving break. according to Vice President for University Affairs
Sorrell Chesin.

(‘ltcsirt. who is also chairperson of the Student Directory Committee.
cited tltree major reasons for the delay. First. he said. since school
started a week later this year. the usual early November printing was
dclttycd.

He explained that yet another obstacle was the delay in the "running"
ol’ names and addresses. That is. the committee waited longer to com-
pile the directory in order to make it more accurate. “With triples
' breaking up. students changing rooms and students coming and going,

tlte delay enabled us to assemble more accurate information," said
L‘ltcsin.

the third factor in the delay was a move to a new publishing com-
pany, said (‘lresitL "In preyiotrs years we tried to put out the directory
ourselves. This year we moved to a local. commercial company." he
\llid. '

According to (‘hcsim the tnmc was needed because in tire past UAS
‘ tbsotbed art e\pctlsc ot' $l5tlt) to $2000 on tltc directory every year.
‘Now, tltc cutttrnet'cinl t'irtn rtrtts the risk. They go out on a limb, so to
\DCilis, hoping to make a profit," said ('hesin.

“ l‘ltis cottrpany rloes other directories. brtt this is their first college
one." (‘hesirt said. Rather than dealirtg with large manufacturers who
might trdtet tisc iii a regional directory. tltcy had to deal with srrtall corn-
patties that attract college students, like ‘l)otn's piI/a' attd so on. this
again added to tire delay.“ ('hcsitt said. ‘
