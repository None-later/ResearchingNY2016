Overspending leads to financial worries for SA

 

By [an Clements
STAFF WRITER

m.“
Student Association. currently
faced with the possibility of
overspendlng its budget. is drawing
up plans that would encourage SA
funded groups to stay within their
alloted budgets. according to SA
Controller Adam Barsky.

Barsky said he has drawn up two
plans. One proposal is a “5 percent
across the board cut." the other
plan involves freezing the budgets
of SA-sponsored groups which have
overspent during the ﬁrst semester.

SA President Rich Schaffer

acknowledged that overspending
has been a chronic problem for SA.
“We're trying to make SA ﬁscally
responsible. There's been an at-
titude of la-di-da. let next year's SA
take care of the problem." he said.

The groups that Barsky cited as
the “real problems" are the dance.
theater and music councils and
cultural organizations. such as
Fuerza Latina.

“These groups require lots of
money for their events. httt they
don't draw as much as campus-wide
groups." said Barsky. "Campus-
wide groups" include the food and
record co-ops and the Uitiverslty

Concert Board. he explained.

He said that the problem groups
are “not money-makers." But he
stressed the need to continue fun-
ding these organizations at decreas-
ed income lines.

Under the current system. Barsky
said groups “have no incentive to
make their income lilies." He pro-
posed that groups which chronically
overpscnd should receive lower in-
come lines.

Barsky explained tltat lte has pro
posed some long-range changes in
the budget process. He said that he

Quad Board revises prize request

Indian Quad Board has modified
a request for pri/c money because
they did not believe the Student
Association would grant it in view
of recent SA legislation which lintits
prize allocations. according to
Quad Board President lvan Shore.

Shore explained that. “The Rest-
dent Assistants froru Adirondack
and Cayuga halls proposed a
scavenger hunt as an RA project.
There would be several two-person
teams participating. The prizes were
originally going to amount to up to
5400. First prize was planned to in
a 5125 trip for two to Munhattat
for a Broadway play; second prize
was originally two black and wltitc
televsion sets; and other prizes
would include dinners at
restaurants.

According to liarsky. (‘entral

The reason liarsky cites l'oi pass-

prizes should be used to attract peo-

sky said his ﬁrst short-range pro-
posal would result in a ﬁve percent
budget decrease for all SA-funded
organizations during the second
semester. “Everybody could still
hold events." but some events
would be held on a smaller scale
than usual. he said.

The reason for the budget IICCI-
ing prOposal. Barsky explained. is
that he‘d "rather penalize in-
dividual groups which are causing
problems. than make everyone suf-
fer. Those groups which overspend
will be unable to hold some of their
planned activities under this pro-
posal."

He said. “I don't like to cut. l'd
like to see everyone irrake their in-
come lines. Hopefully some groups
will not spend all their funds and
will offset those which do overs-
pt'litl."

Sales in the Rathskellar are down
from last year. and 'UAS ofﬁcials
are attributing the loss in businnes
to the new drinking age. If these
trends continue, “we could have
some big ﬁnancial problems at the
Rat." according to Norbert Zahm.
General Manager for UAS.

"Sales had'bcen good" before
December l982, but began falling
immediately after the drinking age
was raised. according to Zahm.

At a UAS Board Meeting Friday.
lte stated that sales in the Rat went
down 25 percent itt December,
1982. when the drinking age was
raised. In September 1983, sales
were down 40 percent. he said.

"We're losing business. not
money." said Zahm. "The increase
iii the drinking age has had a
negative effect on Ratltskellar
business."

Zahrn cslitttalcs that 40 percent
if the students living on-carnpus are
Ltlitlcl‘ age 1‘). Pat 'l‘ercnziui. Direc-
tor of institutional Research.
estimated that about 36 pcrcertl. or
2,200 students. the majority of
which are new freshmen who live on
campus. are too young to drink.

Lester Hynes. director of campus
center food services. placed the
ﬁgures at over 50 percent.

“Freshmen are the most likely to
stay on campus to drink. They are a
lot less mobile (than up-
perclassmen). and they don't know
Albany," said Zahm. The higher
drinking age has prohibited the ma-
jority of the freshmen from drink-
ing. he continued.

According to Zahm. part of the
problem could also' be that the
students are becoming bored with
“the same old Rat. We remodeled it
“our years ago. but we can't afford
to do that every year." he said.

“Classes also started later this
year." said Zahm. “and that could
affect our sales figures."

Hynes said that students are go-
ing off-campus more these days.
"Thursday is our best night. l’coplc
go off (campus) on Friday and
Saturday nights," lte continued.

The Rat is currently undergoing
changes in its programming for Fri-
day and Saturday nights. according
to llynes. "We're trying an open
tttike night. and maybe comedians
or mime acts." ltc continued. some
of which will be itttplcincntcd later
in the semester.

A disco weekend was already

held. but. as compared to other
weekends. “attendance was down
slightly" during the disco event.
said Hynes.

Zahm said he believes that the
drinking age will reach 2|. “slowly
but surely." According to Zahm.
“the Rat could not continue at the
present level of service" if the
drinking age is raised.

"We'll have less programming,
and less personal service." said
Zahm. “Sales will go down even
further."

There is a chance that the
SUNYA campus could be declared
dry if the drinking age is raised to
2i. said Zahm. “That's a decision
for the college administration rtnd
president to make,” he added.

“if the campus goes dry. we'd
have to overhaul the pub," said
Hynes. I‘lt could become a coffee
house-type thing. with non-
alcoholic drinks - a place for relaxa-
tion and entertainment." be con-
titrued.

“it's too early too tell" whether
tltc Rat will undergo arty modifica-
tion. said Zahm. Any changes will
not take place this year. and “next
year'a long shot" for modiﬁcation
as well, according to Zahm. l' 1

Transcribing service proposed to aid students

By Aileen Brown

Help is on the way for tltosc
students who ltave had to strain to
hear the professor in a lecture
:cntcr course due to a poor sound
system or a disruptive class.

Under a trial proposal for the
spring of nexr year. a lcctttre
transcription service will be
available in certain courses which
have eitrollcd more titan l00
students. Tltis service will provide
to all students. for a fee. a copy of
all class lectures given during the
semester.

The transcription service. pro-
posed by Ammanuensis lintcr-
prises. Ltd.. a private company.
would with the prior permission of

SUNYA lacturo cantor class

the instructor. tape the lectures of
certain courses. "These tapes will
be transcribed. proofread. cor-
rected (faculty will have the option
of review). dtitcd. reproduced and
distributed to students who have
subscribed to this service." accor-
ding to Judith A. Ramalcy, Vice
President of Academic Affairs. iii a
memorandum to deans, chairs and
program directors.

Tltc proposal has already
generated controversy among the
faculty and administration;
however. a "trite semester trial with
faculty participation should iri-
dicate to us if tltc service is
beneficial to the university or not."
Rainaley said. “At the beginning of
the spring semester. we will be but-

Tlie proposed transcribing service would cost $30 per set/mister

ter able to answer such questions as:
Did it help the faculty and students?
is it intrusive? Did it affect atten-
dance? These are critical factors
which we will be watching."

The program has also already
been discussed and reviewed by the
administration and the
Undergraduate Academic Council.
The response. Ramalcy said. was
generally favorable. despite possible
drawbacks to the service. “I think it
is a good idea that we try it. even
though there has been sortie
negative feedback." said Cathy
LaSusa. chairperson of the UAC.
“Maybe some of the detrirncnts can
be worked out."

The service would provide some
obvious advantages to students in

 

several ways. First of all, it would
assist students in alleviating the
pressure to copy down every word
the professor utters. "If the pro-
fessor has taken the time to state a
fact in class. lte must ltave thought
it was important enough to
'ccord." stated Rick Dalby. one of
lie eo-owners and originators of
Arnrntinuensis. "Having a verbatim
copy of the professor's lecture will
enable the students to listen and
concentrate irt class instead of wor-
rying about the notes.
The transcriptions will allow
students to review the lectures
before the test." said Dalby.

Secondly. the service will “pro-
vide a transcript for students tltnt
titiss the class for legitimate
reasons." according to Ramalcy.
“They will have the opportutiity to
review the transcripts instead of
having to borrow another student's
notes. The service also has obvious
advantages for handicapped
students. They will have the oppor-
tttnity to have at copy of the pro-
fessor's lecture without having to sit
and listen to tapes. This would
reduce tltcir burden."

Tltc service would also assist the
instructors in several ways. The
professors would be given it com~
pliiitctttory copy of the transcripts.
This would enable the professor to
ltave a "written account of class
material to be used .in class
discrepancies if the coverage of a
particular item is disputed." accor-
ding to a report issued by the UAC.
The professor would also ltavc the
right to edit or clarify the
transcripts should an error appear.

During tltc review of Amrnanucn-
sis by the administration and the
UAC. certain itnpediments to the
program have also been illustrated.
Tire primary disadvantge to the pro;
grain is that it could conceivably cri-
courage is drop in attcndattcc.
"There has beeti concern voiced by
‘certain faculty members that
students migltt subscribe to tire
transcription service and then riot
attend.” Rantaley said. "This is a
very real possibility."

llowcvcr. lit the examples provid—
ed by Aintnturucnsis. transcription
services at SUNY Downstatc
Medical School and note-taking scr~
vices at the University of California
at Berkeley did ttot pcrceptibly ttf~

feet attendance. Students still have
to attend lectures to hear the stress
placed on certain topics. the com-
pany contends. "There are two
ways to learn." said LaSusa. “You
can learn by reading, or by listening
and experiencing. The transcripts
are like a textbook. You cannot see
what has been emphasized if you
did not attend the lecture."
Another objection to the service
which ltns been raised is that the
subscription fee of $30 per class is
too high. “One of tire key problems
that i can forsec is that the $30 per
course per semester might be an un-
fair burdcn to the students. Certain
people aren't as economically ad-
vantaged as others." said LnSusa.
"it might be an unfair advantage
for these who cart afford the service
over those who eanttot. This would
make it inequitable for those
students who could not subscribe."
There is a possibility. however. that
tudents who receive ﬁnancial aid
could add these costs ttttder texts.

Anunamrensis is also concerned
with tile issue. according to Kate
van Schaick. one of the originators
)f the company. She said that a
type of work—study would be
available to itccdy students. “We
are willing to hire a liiriitcd number
of students to help with distribu-
‘ion." she said. “in return. these
students would be provided with the
:omplctc transcripts of their
course." '

Finally. the transcripts might
possibly be a hindrance to both
teachers arid students itt that it
might “cramp the lndividual‘s
teaching style. . .and shift the crit-
phusis from traditional learning to
test-taking and exams." according
to tire UAC report. Ammanuensis'
position it) this matter is that “We
hope the only changes the
transcripts will implement will be
improvements that will help and
enhance a professor‘s teaching
abilities. The north should be
toward the students that don't have
the service. The professor should
not gear the course towards the
students that do have the

transcripts." said Dalhy.

The service is .scltctltllctl for n

'otte-sctitester lrial.duiing the spring

1984 scriiester. littrlltcr publicity
will indicate to students the logistics
of registering for this service. Li
