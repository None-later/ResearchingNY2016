Gathering celebrates Hispanic studentS’ unity

By RoberLtht

'Puerto Rican Discovery Day. a
gatheFing organized to celebrate the

 

 

discovery of Prrerto Rico by‘

Christoplter Columbus 390 years
ago. was held Friday night in the
Humanities Lounge. The event.
sponsored by Fuer/a Latina. a
student-run organi/ation aimed at
uniting Hispanic students at
SUNYA. was mainly a social event.
with cheese. crackers. Salsa music
and dancing.

Although the event. like most of
tire events organi/ed by l-‘uerra
Latina. was mainly to "provide tlte
Hispanics of our cantpus with social
artd subcultural events.” as Robert
.lustiniano of the group's cttlture
department said. the dancing and
music tltat trigltt was proceeded by a
filnt about Puerto Rico called.
"Paradise Lost."

The film. a political documentary
made. by the Latin-American Film
Project and the Talia-American
Studies department at SUNY-
Buffalo. tried to explore tlte oppres-
slort of Hispanics by American
econorttie imperialism and control.
SUNYA Prol'essor Edna Ac0sta
Benet. in introducing the film.
spoke on it's backgrottrtd and
significance as well as well as bring-
ing up wltat she said was "the need
to strengthen ourselves as a group."

The film sltowed extensive
footage on the effects of economic
domination by the U.S.. industries
and factories. arid outlined their cn-
vironmental as well as economic
damage. The images of the film
were narrated against an informal
lecture given by David Rafael Her-
nandez. a major labor leader in
Puerto Rico. “Our island is rielt."
lte said. "bill it has unfortunately

bycn used by foreigners." Scenes ol'
the sugar plantations of the early
twentieth century and the industries
of" the present were ﬂushed at dif-
fercnt intervals as Hernandez
spoke. Footage ol' the extremely
violent quellings ol' wage protests
and strikes of the l930‘s and 1950‘s
were shown as well. The film tried

to display some of the reasons that '

l’nerto Ricans come to America
looking for better conditions. but
they are only meet with “disillu-
sionment and racisrrt" as llcr-
nrtndcl. said.

Tlte film closed with Hernandez
saying. "American in-
dustry ltas not provided incotrtc. It
has ottly taken our resources mtd
gisen us uncrnployrttent. Now is the
titne to cttd colonialism. artd the on‘

4 ly way we will ever do that is by

handing together and milling as a
group." lloth Justiniano and David
Martinel. president of the liner/a
Latina agree that uniting as a group
is tlte stated purpose of l‘ttL‘r/tl
Latina. though their intmediadtc
motives are helping one another
making life at SUNYA artd in
America a more pleasant ex-
perience.As Martinez said, "i am
proud ol' my llispartic decent."
litter/a I.atina ltas held many of
these events over this last semester
and itt years before. Accordittg to
Mttrtincl. the organi/ation. which
is about seven years old. keeps itself
front getting political attd tr'ies to
hold social csents that are airrtcd at
uniting the llispurties on campus.
"We throw parties that are mainly
cultural events." he said.
"Sometimes. the discussion of
political issues are inevitable. but
we really want just to get together

According to Martinez. other
problems ltave been a diminishing

Of the 55 couples that erttered

36 were still swaying to the music

After the tttaratltort was over.

“Wltert we registered they kept

"At first people rttoved away

College‘papers face tough year

Minneapolis, MN
(CPS) As rttnch ol' the college press
struggles tltrottglt what may be its
toughest y'ar yet. a federal court
has ruled that the University of
Minnesota paper can return to its
old method of collecting strident
fees.

The ruling could ltelp set a prece-
dertt for making student funding of
campus papers a First Arrtendrnertt
issue.

After tltc Minnesolu Dar/y
published a wild "lntrttor issue" irt
1979. tlte university's regents made
student fee fttrtdittg of tire paper op-
tiortal for students.

lint last week the 8th Circuit
Court of Appeals rttled tltc regents
ltad interfered with freedom of' the
press. attd actually were trying to
ittfltrcncc the paper's editorial cott-
tettt by changing the fee system.

lint the long-awaited Minnesota
fee d ion is about the only good
news for college newspapers so far
dtrrirtg the 1982-83 school year.

Scores of papers are strttgglirtg
with budget cuts. wltile others ac~
tually are folding urtder tltc weight
of budget problerrts and student
apathy.

Papers at lllittois Eastern Com-
munity College, Lakeland College.
Harford Commurtity College. Glen
Oaks Community College. attd
Western Wyoming Community
College. among otlters. had deep
budget cuts this year.

Sonte aren't evctt that lucky. At
Phoenix College. “we took a look
at the cost of the college paper irt
relation to the information we have
to get out to students, and decided
it was too cost-prohibitive for a stu-
dent body of H.000." reported Jim
llugltes. head of the school's pttblic
information office. Phoenix Col-
lege. consequently. has no stttdcttt
paper at all this year. Ad-
ministrators plan to produce a mon»
tltly calendar and newsletter itt—
stcad. for “considerably less tltart
the $700 per issue we were spending
on the paper." Hughes said.

Kendall College itt livanston, lll..
also has replaced its monthly stu-
dent paper with a p.r. newsletter.

"We didn't pick up (funding for)
the student paper again this year
because of lack of interest and cttts
in student services funding." said
Janice Glor of Kendall's student
services office.

 

She estitnatcd Kendall will save
$2250 by tttergirrg its news opera-
tions with tile public relations
department‘s newsletter. Students
are left to get news frortt "a campus
calcrtdar posted itt some of the
classrooms."

Sometimes apathy is to blartte as
much as mortcy. At l’ltconix Col-
lege. where crtrolltttcttt ltas been
climbing steadily t'or tltrce years.
"we just didn't have a lot ol'stttdent
interest." llugltes said. " The staff
was volunteer. artd duringI finals a
lot of people stopped coming irt attd
working,"

Kendall‘s newspaper staff was
“down to one or two students last
year really working on the paper."
(iltrr said. “We ha\cn't ltad arty
complaints from anyone wlro wants

'tlre paper back."

“It's very easy for art administra-
tiort to do away with a paper if
tltcre are no students interested
enough to work on it or fight for
it." noted Dick Sublctte. presidcttt
ol' College Media Advisors. the
trade group for campus newspaper
advisers. attd publications director
at UCLA.

lint lack of staff “coincides with
what's ltappertirtg with jottrnalistn
school enrollment generally," said
Len Franko. director of the
Artterican Society of Journalism
School Administrators and a jour-
ttalisrrt professor at the University
of South Carolina.

"We've ltad a bulge in jour-
nalism majors for the last l0 to 12
years." he explained. “Now. after
doubling iii the last ten years,
enrollment has finally leveled ottt"
to about 80.000 majors nationwide.

Tlte declittc. coupled with catn-
ptrses‘ general money woes. has pit-
ted many papers against their ad-
ntinistrators.

Adrttirtistrators gradually ltave
been forcing larger campus papers“
to pay rrtore of their costs by
generating more of their 0th
revenues through advertising sal s.
As a result. some papers have
becorttc successful crtough to ctrt
most of their formal fiscal ties to
their schools.

"‘But at a lot of smaller univer-
.sitics, where the papers didn’t move
out on their own. the unvcrsities
have been picking up the tab for in-’
creased salaries. equipment. space.
and other subsidies." Franko said.

 

Fewer schools are willing to keep
doing so. More administrators.
Franko maintains. arc tellittg
students. “if you wartt a
newspaper. you pay for it." if no
students respond, Sublette added.
“there goes the paper."

At Pcppcrdirtc University irt
Malibu. California. administrators
“asked its to contribute rrtore
advertising revettuc toward orrr own
productiort costs," said Steve
Attics. director of strtdcrtt publica»
tiotts. Altltorrglt the paper is "finanv
cially very solid." it ltas had to
tigltten its belt to jump from 10 to
20 pages per issttc tltis year.

UCLA‘s I)llll_l‘ Ill'lllll, Sublette
said. has bencl'itted front snelr forc-
ed fiscal responsibility. Since being
told to pay its owrt way. the paper
now operates “totally iii the black.
and cvctt helps support some of the
school's other pttblicatiorts."
