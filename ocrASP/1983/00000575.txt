‘Day After’ responses"

rained.

show the movie on moral grounds.
“If social responsibility sells radial

The leftists. he said. who wrote
and supported the movie “want to
see America fail, causing the
economy to fall. which will cause
social. internal revolution.”

? , L ' _, Department Chair
Gordon Gallup said he thought the
movie was scary. but that the paren-
tal discretion advisory was for the
most part unnecessary. “I don’t
think it had any more blood and
gore than most things I've seen on
T.V.." he explained.

Gallup noted that the absence of
traditional values was a realistic
portrayal of what a widespread
disaster could lead to. He cited. for
example. the scene where a man
returning to his home is shot after
asking some people what they were
doing there.

“I think the reactions that it (the
movie) depicted were better than
the effects shown. (speciﬁcally) the
way people responded to terms of
the aftermath." Gallup said.

Gary Hobbs. from the Univsersity
Counseling Center. advised
students to consider whether they

counseling session Monday morn-
Ing for students who wanted to talk
about the impact of the movie.
Hobbs reported that a small
group of students showed up. most
expressing a "sense of shock at the

normal reactions to the movie.

In addition, said Hobbs. students
were reminded of other causes. such
as the civil rights movement that at
one time seemed hopeless.

Also. Hobbs noted. students
were encouraged to become more
informed on the issue, and to
realize that the problem is ultimate-
ly solvable.

SUNYA ROTC member Bran-
don Flctchcr said he watched the
movie "very seriously." The movie.
hc explained. didn't show him
anything new. Fletcher said he op-
poses nuclear weapons, but believes
we need a strong conventiul army to
replace the need for nuclear
weapons.

"if we have a strong enough con-
vential force. then the national
policy makers will never feel so
backed up into a corner that they
even have to entertain the possibili-
ty of nuclear weapons." he
asserted.

The movie brought home an inr-
portant point. he said. “We‘ve got

Down Town will provide perti-

landlords. In addition. it will cover
lighter topics. such as parties. Ac
cording to Auletla. a gossip column

Holiday plans range from
turkeys to Zen Buddhism

By Christine Rcffelt
STAFF WRITER

 

 

“In order to become more involved in myself." Haltar explained. "I‘ve
decided to get closer to universal Harmony by meditating for to hours a
day for three days." As a result. he added. "I will be spiritually cleans-
ed... ,

Some students however. aren't interested in meditation. Jeff Yates.
for instance. is going skiing in Vermont to get closer to nature. “I'm in
an adventurous mood this year." said Yates. “but of course I'll still fit:
the turkey in sometime during the day." he added.

Terry (ioodcrnclc, a freshman. said that he was hunting ~ what else
but a turkey - this Thanksgiving. “After I find a nice size one. Grund-
rnother cleans it and we have a feast.”rhe explained. “I guess the tradi»
rional supermarket bird is two conventional for him." mused his room«
mate. Dave.

Some people don‘t even eat turkey. Alicitl CinrboruJor instance. said
“I'm Italian and we always have tons of pasta. But." she continued.
“of course we have to put a turkey on the table because of tradition. No
one cars it.“ she csplaiucd. "but the point is that at least it's there." she
added.

Wayne Anderson. a freshman. is going to his annual High School
Thanksgiving football game held on the traditional day itself. “It's a
fun way to spend the day." he said. "And I get good and hungry by the
endi.” he added.

John Parker. also a freshman, can‘t wait to go home so he can see his
girlfriend. Dunesc. "although she has been up here the last 3
weekends." he said. “I still want to see her!"

Some students aren‘t so lucky. and can't go honre at all. Maura
Mnrkidou. for example. a junior from Cyprus, is staying downtown in
Suylcsiiall. She plans to study and eat a lot. she said. “because five days
is not enough time to go home. It's too espensive." she stated. "and not
worth the trip."
