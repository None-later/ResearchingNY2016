research."

With the Impact of this report.
Taylor said that "all kinds of pro-
grams were killed off and the
money taken to fund research and
Ph.D.s, this got the university Into
a lot of trouble. It was a stupid,
stupid move." Taylor maintained
that the process was still occurring,
just not receiving any public atten-
tion.
Taylor said this trend encourages
even more professors to spend time
in research, not In the classroom.
He continued by saying that “this
University should have Its highest
priority undergraduate education.
not (as) the lowest priority."

Taylor further noted that “not a
single top salary goes to teachers for
teaching.” and that the ad-
ministrators are the highest paid
members of SUNYA’s staff. This
Taylor sees its a major obstacle to
improving the faculty at SUNYA.

Taylor explained, “I wanted to
raise a lot of these issues last year
but the President perfectly
understandably said he was terribly
busy, and speak to the director of
undergraduate studies.”

He found that the directorate was
a part-time job in the Vice President
for Research's ofﬁce. This year the
undergraduate studies directorship
is a position In the V.P. for
Academic Affairs office.

Taylor called for a Vice President '

I for Undergraduate Studies to be ap-
pointed "that has real power and
some commitment to
undergraduate education."

Ramaley said the university
follows the “seven year rule," that
is, a tenure decision must be made
within a teacher's first seven years
at an institution. The actual deci~
sion whether or not to grant lenurt
is made in the sixth year to allow r.
teacher time to find employmcnr
elsewhere if not granted tenure.
Without tenure. a teacher can not
remain at an institution In the same
position for more than seven years.

A tenure or promotion applicant

' is first reviewed by a faculty review
board in each department. A
dossier containing research and
recommendations is compiled and
after input from the dcpartmen‘
chair the application is sent for a se-

' cond level of review.

The personnel committee of I
school or college adds to tht

ldossier, makes a recommendation,
and after it is reviewed by the dean
of the school, the application is sent
to a third level of review.

SUNYA'S university-wide review
board is the Council on Promotion
and Continuing Appointment,
which reports to the Vice President
for Academic Affairs. When they
have made recommendations and
additions to the dossier. the entire
packet is sent to the University
President.

It is the President who makes the
final decision. and Ramaley pointed
out that all levels of review act
simply as advisers to the President.

She also noted that at all levels of
the process the applicant has access
to the dossier and results of each

' review.

Decisions are made according to
three criteria: original research or
scholarship teaching. and service to
the university and committee. ac-
cording to Ramaiey.

Research and scholarship are
judged on the basis of peer reviews,
she said. Letters are solicited from
people in the discipline outside the
institution and department col-
leagues may subrnlt comments.

Teaching Is currently judged
from a summary of strident opinion
and comments by department col-
leagues. Ramaley said that other

‘- 1 Tenure system. questioned

possibilities were being discussed,
Including a more direct peer review
of course syllabi. tests, and possibly
attending classes taught by the ap-
pllcant.

She noted that students and peers
evaluate different aspects of a
teacher's perfomance. Students
evaluate the way in which a subject
is taught, while peers can judge how
completely a subject is taught.

Service, which Ramaley said is
the least important, is measured
chieﬂy by a list of services perform-
ed by the applicant for the universi-
ty and the community.

SUNYA President O'Leary
defended research being so much a
part of tenure and promotion deci-
sions by explaining that SUNYA is
a university center and must
facilitate and demand research on
the part of every member of the
staff.

O'Leary did not see this as bad
for students, but rather as ex-
teremely beneﬁcial because students
were kept up to date on what was
happening In a ﬁeld through their
professor's research.

O'Leary resonded to Taylor's call
for an Undergraduate Studies Vice
President by saying "there are
always some who want to separate
completely graduate and
undergraduate education. but that
can't be done, both are part of the

own".

same university."

Professors from different depart-
ments had varying responses to
Taylor's charges. Taylor prophesiz-
ed their reactions when he said
many of his peers would not agree
with him.

Professor Warren Roberts of the
History Department, said that he
believes “that scholarship is over-
whelmingly the most important
criterion" for making tenure and
promotion decisions. “Teaching is
given only token importance," he
added.

He continued by saying
"teaching should receive more
weight than it does" but decisions
should not be made solely on
teaching ability.

Forntcr Prof. Yulshilr Chen,
who Is suing SUNY bccarrs‘e of the
ruling handed down on her tenure
decision, said simply “in my ex-
perience... it doesn't really matter,
they shift criteria around."

While she stressed she was speak-
ing only for the College of
Humanities and Fine Arts, she said
"even if you have publications you
can ,be sucked. but it is hard to just
teach because your classroom work
depends on your research."

She said she agreed with Taylor
that original research was overrated
as a factor In making tenure promo-
tion decisions.

Communications Professor Alan
Chartock who teaches at both
SUNYA and SUNY-New Pultz.
said he believes that research and

1 teaching are suppOscd to be in a
balance throughout the SUNY
system. but that the balance is Inter-

 

preted differently throughout the
system. ‘

“My personal belief... Is that our
basic mission is to educate students
and there is no way- to do that
without excellent teaching," Char-
tock said.

Chartock's solution to the pro-
blem is to “keep research standards
but emphasize that research without
good teaching is insufﬁcient for
'tenure.”

Speaking of professors, he said.
“they have to publish if that's the
rule of the Univeristy and to be fair
to the students they have to be good
teachers.”

Professor Bruce Miroff of the
Political Science Department
agreed that “the charges that
teaching is not appreciated are
merited." He said the university Itns
not developed enough ways to
measure teaching abilities and that
"exceptional teaching should be
taken seriously and awarded.”

Professor Richard Orville of the
Atmospheric Sciences Department.
discounted Taylor’s charges. "At a
University center —‘ the emphasis
on research is quite proper," he
said. He continued. "the most ac-
tive researcher is very often one of
your best teachers."

Students have an exceptional 0p-
portunlty to learn from research
professors. he said. He finished by
saying that those without rcsearclt
skills should not be at a university
center but at a college.

Taylor cited a specific example of
a teacher forced out by the universi-
ty emphasis on research, political
science professor Pete Cocks.

Cocks said he did not apply for
tenure because he didn't want his
department to go through all tltc
hassle when there was only one con-
clusion likely, that is, tenure would
not be granted.

He will Icave SUNYA after the
spring semester, seeking rt job in
either teaching or industry, depen-
ding on what is available.

Cocks said that one of tire
reasons research is so inrporttrnt in
making tenure decisions is that that
rcquircs relatively less work on the
part of administrators who are
“primarily concerned with getting a
better career for themselves.”

Taylor said Cocks had no chance
for tenure because he had not work-
ed on getting himself published.
“The sad thing about Peter Cocks
is that while everyone realizes what
a great teacher he is. not a single ud-
minlstrator would try to save him."

Miroff said he knew of many fine
teachers who have left for the same
reason Cocks is leaving. “I think
it’s an extraordinary tragedy for the
students of SUNY-Albany that the
University found no way to retain
Peter Cocks," he ﬁnished.

Rnnraley said that l‘I do know
from what I have heard that he is a
well respected and well liked
teacher, an inspiring teacher."

She said that nevertheless he
could not be granted tenure. “The
thing to keep in mind... is that at
this institutiotr cvcry faculty
member Is expected to have a mix of
all three (research. teaching, ser-
vice) of these elements and that
there must be a certain minimum
level of original scholarship work
on anyone here, because that's part
of being at a university center." She
suggests Cocks ﬁnd a job at a col—
lege. where teaching by itself is “the
main thing that happens."

Student Association President
and Political Science Major Rich
Schaffer suid Cocks' leaving is n
"sad commentary for this universi-
ty." He said that SA is looking for
ways to investigate anti become
more Involved in the lcrrrtrc rrnd
promotion prn-t'sscs so that SA
could “ﬁnd out where exact pro-
blems are. " L‘l
