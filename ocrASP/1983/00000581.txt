Edward L. Rowny'was the second'since the
Soviet Union walked out of parallel medium-
range missiles talks Nov. 23. v

said the talks will go on.

. Beirut. Lebanon
(AP) A French soldier was killed by sniper
ﬁre Thursday. and Beirut’s airport remained
closed after anti-government Drusc
militiamen threatened to resume an artillery
barrage unless a series of demands was met.

The threat came as Lebanese President
Amin Gemayel arrived in Washington for
meetings Thursday with President Reagan

.a‘ndvother U.S. ofﬁcials to discuss ways of
removing foreign troops from his country.

The French soldier was killed when his
patrol was ﬁred on Thursday morning by an
unidentiﬁed gunman along the "green line"

spokesman for the French peacekeeping

.AndrOpov to appear.

. Moscow
(AP) The Soviet Parliament will meet Dec.
28. the Soviet news agency Tass announced
Thursday. It was expected that President
Yuri V. Andropov. out of public view for
more than too days, will appear at the
meeting.

Andropov's long absence had fueled
speculation that the 69—year-old leader was
too ill to attend a meeting of the Supreme
Soviet. the nation’s nominal Parliament. or a
plenum of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party that normally precedes it.

Andropov made his last public appearance
Aug. is when he met with a group of U.S.
senators. The official Kremlin explanation
for his absence from public view has been
that he has been suffering from a cold.

Horse kills women

New York City
(AP) A 7l-year-old woman died three days
after being struck by a runaway horse while
she rode a bicycle in Central Park. "the ﬁrst
such death in modern memory." said Parks
Commissioner Henry Stern.

Ofﬁcials learned of the death Wednesday,
after the woman’s family announced burial
arrangements. and Stern'banned the horse
.from the park pending and investigation of

Reagan eyes research

Washington, D. C.
(AP) President Reagan, settling a dispute
among his key advisers. had decided to
authorize long«term research and develop-
ment of weapons to repel nuclear attacks
rather.than a hurry-up approach administra-
tion officials said Thursday.

The decision was described as the more.
cautious of two choices presented to Reagan
at a meeting Wednesday with his national
sccttrity advisers.

The alternative. said the ofﬁcial, was to
launch a program to deploy defensive
weapons quickly.

Reagan first announced last March the
United States would begin work on a
futuristic defense system designed to.dcstroy
Soviet missiles in ﬂight and render “these
nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete."
Opponents of the so-called “star wars“
speech said going ahead would open a new
arms race.

Escort service ends; pilot programa   

By Ian Clements r
STAFF WRITER

The Don't Walk Alone Escort'

Service, considered a success by its
creators, ﬁnished its pilot run on
Thursdr "cc. l

The ll be ‘no more escorts for
the remainder of the semester. Dan
one of the program's
directors. announced during
Wednesday‘s Central Council
meeting. .

Supporters of the service are cur-
rently seeking permanent financial
backing from the SUNYA ad-
ministration to resume operation of
the service next semcstcr.'SA fund-
ed the pilot program.

Maggie Aucr. another escort ser-
vice director. explained that “many
of the escorts are nervous about
finals" so they do not want to par-
ticipate dttring the rest of the
semester. Alttttan noted however
that the program is in a pilot stage
and thal it was only supposed to last
for approximately one month.

According to Aucr, ottc of the
reasons that the new cscorl program
is cttding before finals week is that
some escorts have not been showing
up to work. “i tltink it‘s kind of
stupid to stop it now. but a lot of
volunteers haven't been doing tltcir
job." Aucr said. “We can‘t work
with just twenty pcoplc who nrc
willing to come out.“ she added.

Sotnc escorts later said that they
were disappointed that tltc program
was ending before the semester's
completion.

John Harrison. an escort said,
“the program should go tltrough
finals week. During finals most
people study alone. When I cram i
get away from everybody."

According to Harrison. escorts
cttrrcntly work in two ltour shifts.
He suggested that the shifts be cut
to one hour during finals week to
allow each escort more study time.

USSR/A Iban y exchange goes one way

By Betsy Eckel
slut-r urn/um

it is ttnlikcly that tcn exchange
stttdcnts from Russia who were
scheduled to study this semester at
SUNYA will be able to come to the
school at all, said Alex Shane. the
director of SUNYA’s Office of in-
ternational Programs.

“I don‘t thtnk they’ll come
because there is less than two weeks
left in the fall semester and the
Soviet Union isn't issuing any exit
visas. i believe that this is a general

escort. agreed. "Supposedly there is
an overload of escorts.". he said.
:” ’ maintained that there
are enough escorts to continue the

~ program with shorter shifts.

“I have a lot of work.” said
escort John Curry. He said that he
supported the decision to end the
program on December I.

A student who was being escorted
who wished to remain unidentified
said. “I'm disappointed that the
program is ending before finals.
since that's the time when most peo-
ple use the library and need the
escort service."

Debbie Kestin. an escorted stu-
dent, said of the program. “I ap-
pluttd it and i give a lot of credit to
the escorts."

Aucr said that the Board of
Directors of Don't Walk Alottc has
been rcportittg the program‘s
results to the President‘s Task
Force on Women’s Safety. but itt
order to receive Administration
funding llte proposals must he
made to tire Campus Life Cittntnit-
lcc chaired by Vice Prcsidcnt of
Student Affairs Frank Poguc.

Aucr said that the proposal will
explain what tltc program's goals
were and ltow they were attained. It
will also include figures on the
runount of people who were
escorted. shc stated. According to
Poguc. tltc Campus Life Committee
is one of tire sourccs ltc will consult
before making his funding recom-
mendations to President Vincent
O'Leary. ()‘l.cury will make tltc
final decision on funding tltc Don't
Walk Alonc'program. said Pogue.
He and the Campus Life Commit-
tee will review tltc results oftltc pro-
gram and act immediately upon
receiving them to make recommen-
dations to O‘Lcary. Poguc stated.

Altman said that 107 students
volunteered to bc escorts. He said
that in the program in the first
month 407 students were escorted.

~Aucr pointed out that the escort

said Shane.

He also noted that the lifting of
the Canadian butt on Acroflot
operations. which was implemented
as a response to tire Soviet downing
ofa Korean airliner with 267 people
aboard. had little to do with the
Soviet decision not to send tltc
students to SUNYA. '

According to the New York

service. until recently operated by
the Public Safety Department of the
University. only escorted approx-
imately 35 students each semester.

Altman said that he may propose
that escorts be given women’s
studies or community service credit.
He said that this will give escorts
greater incentive to participate
through finals week.

According to Maura Kugler. one ‘

of ten escort service coordinators.
the program’s popularity increased
after its commencement on
November 5.

"So many people wanted to tic
escorts. that we ran out of applica-
tions.“ she said.

Kuglcr said that 25 studcttts wcrc
escorted on tltc program‘s first
night, attd that recently the pro-
gram had avcragcd 35 escorts each
evening.

Also during the council meeting;

that though no ‘jnumcrical bids"
have been made for tltc purchase of
SA's audio-visual ,

“there is a possibility of getting rid
of it this semester."

He said that he will be taking bids
until Wednesday. December 7.

The complaint voiced by Silk on

SA‘s executive branch failed to con-
sult with council on a “major

The issue concerned SA Prcsi-

23 issue of the Albany Student

students and tltcir advisor were
scheduled to arrive Septctuhcr it.
They were scheduled to land in
Montreal because tltc United States
imposed a ban on the Soviet na-
tional airline Aeroflot. after the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in

niansky. their advisor. left for

ed safely on the 14th.

Laura Petrochko, an official at
SUNY-Central said that Wolnian-
sky sends reports to her through the
American Embassy in Moscow. Ac-
cording to Petrochko, the SUNY
students are enjoying their semester
in the soviet Union. '

"it seems from what we've heard
from the advisor (Wolniansky) the
students are having a normal stay.
The situation (with the Soviet
students) hasn't affected them.
They are going to classes and trips
to Leningrad, Vladimir. and Suz-
dal. The group will be returning
between January 7 and January
13." said Pctrochko.

According to Shane the Soviet
students will not be able to come to
SUNYA. this spring because their
schedule requires them to be at the
Thorez institute for that semester.

said that immediate action was re-

quircd and that SA could not afford'

Shane noted that this is tltc first
titnc that the political relationship

SUNY's 17 exchange programs with
l3 countries including China.
Japan. Germany. Israel. Dcnmark.

Foreign student enrollment at

the last several years, from 2l6
students in 1975 to 542 in‘ 1982.
even though no ovcrt recruiting
takes place. said J. Paul Ward. ad-
visor of international students. He
attributes the increase to the high
quality yet relatively inexpensive
education that SUNYA offers.

“Many students who used to at-
tend universitics in England. before
excessive tuition costs were in-
stituted. are attracted to SUNYA
because it’s cheaper. Foreign
students have filled the gap caused
by a down turn in graduate enroll-
ment of U.S. students." said Ward.

Foreign students pay the same
tuition that out-of-statc students
pay at SUNYA which is 52.650 for
undergraduate and $3.l85 for
graduates, said Ward.

The majority complete their educa-
tion itt tltc U.S. and obtain a

One Chinese student said he is
studying international Economics.
and this major is not available in
China. “The Chinese education
system is too strttcturcd and limited
to allow this type of study." he
said. -
According to Ward, 75 percent of
the foreign students are graduate
students while only 25 percent at-
tend as undergraduates. Thc most
popular majors among foreign
students include the social sciences.
the physical sciences. public affairs
and education.

Proficiency in‘English is expected
for foreign students at SUNYA.
Remedial courses are provided for
those who need further work on
tltcir English skills. said Ward.

The Chinese-student also said he
feels that the “quality of faculty
here is far superior to faculty from
my native home."

A student frotn Germany said he
believes that the quality of an
education in his country is equal to
that of the United States. “I just
