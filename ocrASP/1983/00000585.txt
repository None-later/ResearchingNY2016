The problem of arms control. ac-
cording to Kaplan, lies in the
perceptions that the Soviets and the
US. have of each others weapon
capabilities. Each of the two coun-

“Perceptions have hardened in

Soviets have given up on Reagan. if

"These perceptions must be

if this occurs.”

Missiles were politically based.

"These nuclear weapons are an
irrational show," said Clayton
Powers, a- political science major
who attended' the lecture. “They
are militarily useless — govern-

they (governments) are."

Peter Cocks, SUNY Political
Science professor, agreed with
Kaplan’s views on the missiles.
“He covered the topic very well,”
suid Cocks. "Americans think of
the technical aspects. He linked the
political issues with the technical.
The political issues are less talked

Neil Shapiro, internal Affairs

“The constitution hasn't been

very out of date," ltc explained. I,"

One of the ideas under considerag

number of votes Council needs in
order to override a veto by the S/\
President. A majority is nccdcdlrin

committee may suggest a three-
