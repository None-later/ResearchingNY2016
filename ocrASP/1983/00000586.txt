Solomon law cauSes few.istode‘ntsto}.’loso

(CPS) “Very few" students actually
have lost federal ﬁnancial aid
because of the new law requiring
men to register for the draft in
order to get college money, aid of-
ficials around the country report.

The new law, usually called the
Solomon Amendment after law
author Rep. Gerald Solomon
(R-NY). went into effect October 1
after months of delay.

Most students apparently already
registered before the law went into
effect, the officials said. The
number of students now left
without federal aid apparently is
very small.

Two lowa State students, for ex-
ample, refused to sign their com-
pliance forms; the papers swearing
to the aid office that they‘ve
registered; and lost aid, says aid
Director Jerry Sullivan.

Other schools report “a few"
students who purposefully have
refused to sign the form have dis-
qualified themselves from receiving
aid.

But even those students may be
getting aid from their schools.

Because of the numerous delays
and false starts in getting the law in-
to effect, “it’s no wonder we still
have a few students who haven't
signed.” says Jack Sheehan, Boston

law, at least until the Supreme
Court could hear arguments in the
case later this year.

The US. Department of Educa-
tion. which is responsible for enfor-
cing all financial aid laws, reacted
by making the new effective date of
the law August l. But campus aid
officials’ complaints convinced the
department to move the law
deadline back to September I. The
department, then concerned that
students away over the summer
might not have heard about the new
deadline, extended it once again to
October 1.

“Most of our students were first
alerted last spring about the Solemn
Amendment," said Boston's
Sheehan. .“But then we had to drop
it. Then we had to gear it up again.
Then we waited to see what was
next."

“We started telling all our
students to fill out the forms right
after the Supreme Court lifted the
injunction," recalls Yale's Foster.

There was little left to do by Oc-
tober i. “it really has become kind
of a non-issue.” observes Dennis
Martin of the National Association
of Student Financial Aid .-Ad-
ministrators in Washington. DC.

"There was so much fuss over it
and so many changes and so many

 

delays that all the trouble just kind
of went away since it was im-
plemented." adds Education Dept.
spokesman Ducan Helmrich.

“We haven't encountered any
major problems or uprisings since
the Supreme Court lifted the in-
junction," he says.

Indeed, except for’ some minor
protests' on a few campuses:,

Oregon, Lane County Community

College (also in Oregon), West'
Virginia, Columbia, and Hamilton
among them; the compliance date

passed almost without notice. .
But resentment still smolders,
especially among aid directors.
"What we're doing is enforcing a.
lavtl '

against those people who have:

tdv' have financial aid," said Iowa
State's Sullivan.- - ‘ -'

"Congress," adds Yale President
A. Bartlett Giamatti, “has linked
two issues l catt‘separate.”

In 1985. schools themselves will
be responsible for policing students,
a burden they protest they aren't'

Call Suchman. the attorney in the

Supreme Court case chiming the

law is unconstitutional, is confident
it won’t come to that. “)Ve're
hopeful the court will find it un-
constitutional.” _. _

She said the court will hear
arguments “sometime in February.
which means we'll probably get a
decision sometime in May."

University’s financial assistance
director.

Boston was one of the few
schools to support the draft/aid law
initially. BU President John Silber
even announced he'd deny BU's
own aid funds to students who
didn't register.

“But at this point, due to the
lateness of getting the thing into ef-
fect, we are not denying our institu-
tional funds (to non-registrants),”
Sheehan says.

However, “very few" students
didn‘t sign the compliance forms.

“There have been some" who
haven‘t signed at Yale, either. adds
Jackueline Foster, Yale's
undergraduate aid director.

But, “we are making Yale funds
available to them to meet their
financial needs," she adds.

There may not be many students
left to register nationwide anyway.
points out Selective Service
spokeswoman Betty Alexander.

“Let's face it," Alexander sug-
gests, “we do‘have a registration
rate of 98.6 percent, and the
number of those (who haven’t yet
registered) who are in college. and
then who need financial aid, is very
small."

If the amendment was designed
to stampede the few last-minute
registrants into the fold. it hasn't
worked. ‘

She says there has been no in-
crease in the number of registrants
nationwide since the Solomon
Amendment went into effect.

So far. the government has in-
dicted 16 people across the country
for failing to register. There'd be
more, Alexander said, “but many
people who haven’t signed up are
veterans and students who are also
in the National Guard and don’t
realize that, unless they're on active
military duty. everyone over 18
years of age (beginning with
students born from l964 on) must
register."

Aid directors take much of the
credit for getting the vast majority
of students signed up before the
deadline, which had been pushed
back repeatedly.

After being signed into law in
September. l982. the Solomon
Amendment originally was to go in-
to effect July 1. Federal Judge
Donald Alsop, however, declared
the law unconstitutional last spring.

The government appealed
Alsop’s decision, and convinced the

 

U.S. Supreme Court to lift AlsOp's

photapher. "
