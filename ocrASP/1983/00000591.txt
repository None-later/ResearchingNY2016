the Editor: '

his letter is to inform all students. and people in the
pus community. that December 2 has been declared
oul Wallenberg Day by SUNYA President Vincent
Leary. Who was Raoul Wallenberg. and why should
ple acknowledge this day? Raoul Wallenberg was a hero
the holocaust. He was both directly and indirectly
ponsible for saving the lives of approximately l20,000
s. This day. set aside in his honor. is to remind people
what he did and of the countless number of lives that
uld have been lost without his brave efforts.

hanks from Telethon

the Editor:

nce again. we would like to thank everyone who has
pcd us during the course of Telethon 84’s Dance
rathon. A special thank you to all the dancers who par-
'patcd and gathered pledges of over $6010.

e would like to take this opportunity to urge everyone
0 has sponsered a dancer to get their money in as soon as
sible. Typically past Dance Marathons may have had a
stantial amount pledged but only about thirty percent of
total pledged was ever received. We would like to im-

prove on that figure this year, so if you have sponsored a

dancer. again please get your money in as soon as possible. .

All dancers will have an envelope for each sponsor with the
amount pledged written on it.

The proceeds collected will benefit two organizations:
Capital Area Speech Center. which provides speech and
language therapy to speech and-or hearing impaired
children. and Wildwood School which serves developmen-
tally and emotionally handicapped children.

New publication

To The Editor:

1 would like to take this opportunity to commend the
ASP for recognizing OCA’s new newsletter in the article
entitled “OCA Distributes New Publication". in the
November 22nd issue. l'm glad to see that the campus is
beginning to realize the tremendous potential of OCA.
There was a discrepancy in the article which i would like to
mention. The position of “OCA coordinator" no longer

' eklsts. Presently there is a is member Board of Directors

which run the group OCA. These is people are doing a fan-
tastic job. l'm thrilled to work with a group of such lnvcn-
tive and imaginative people. They are the ones that brought
you the OCA Night at W.T.’s and will continue to
enlighten the campus with "Downtown" (the newsletter).
The Board of Directors are working on many new and ex-
citing projects for off-campus students and the Albany
community at large. There is, however. a new position in
the Student Association Executive Branch that is the Off-
Campus Coordinator. this is the position that I hold. As
Off-Campus Coordinator l deal with all “off-campus af-
fairs". represent off-campus student views on different
committees and Task Forces, work on women's safety
issues, initiate off-campus projects. and i work
cooperatively with the Board of Directors as an ex ofﬁcio
member. At this point t can say that me vii-campus student
population couldn’t be served by a more dedicated and car-
ing groups of people.

Tenure policy

To the Editor:

i read with considerable interest the lengthy article in the
November 22 ASP concerning teaching and tenure.
Perhaps Professor Taylor‘s “dramatic condemnation" will
generate some serious discussion of the nature and function
of classroom teaching in a university setting.

For my contribution to that discussion i would like to
turn to an ancient academic tradition and announce my
willingness to defend in public debate the following
“theses” about university teaching. i only ask that some
person other than myself make . the arrangements for such
a debate and that we be guaranteed an audience of at least
five people. Here are my theses.

l. in any large randomly selected group of faculty there
is a small group readily recognized as superior teachers and
another small group easily identified as teaching disasters;
most faculty fall in between. '

2. it's easy to reward the small group of superior
teachers.

3. We should (and probably do) get rid of the disasters
before they are awarded tenure.

Generic society
To the Editor: .

Jim Capozzola's article titled “A No Frills Look at a
Plain Labelled World" suggests that a generic society
would be simpler and better than a choice-oriented one.
and l strongly disagree. While capitalism may have some
serious flaws inherent in its practice, one ofits best features
is the diversity of commodities, entertainment. and even
universities that it tends to generate. Anybody with at least
a minimum of imagination realizes how much more in-
teresting it is to be able to choose among many different
products than among generic brands. i

Can you seriously imagine walking into the store and)
having to “choose” one generic product over another to'
satisfy your particular need or fancy instead of choosing
from several products that have some fancied differences
and are offered for that same need or desire? Suppose you
don’t like a product in a generic-based society, what do you
do then? if it doesn't do the trick, or only partially does.
there is no where else to turn. Can you imagine taking your
girlfriend out for dinner on your anniversary to the
“Special Generic Hot Food Restaurant"? (I can't either.)
Or perhaps to the generic movie theatre?

What about institutions of higher learning? The articles
cites Albany State as being the ideal generic-type university
because of its simplicity. relative cheapness and quality of
education. While the latter are true. what about the
simplicity of buildings? They all have the same exact struc-
ture and color patterns, making locating particular
buildings at first an ordeal and more difficult than at most
other universities. And the dorms, forget about the dorms!
What if somebody does not like generic Albany State,
because he or she is looking for something different? Well.
thankfully there are thousands of universities across the na-
tion to choose from. many of which specialize in a par-
ticular area of education, Albany is a very line university
for you. only if it caters to your particular academic needs
and interests. .

Coparzola makes one very valid point in saying that evenI
generic brands are becoming labelled. This is where one'
capitalistic drawback comes to play. Even if we were
sotnehow able to reach a generic society, competition
would eventually evolve among generic companies that
would cause some to go out of business. Soon there would
be monopolistic generic brands causing higher prices. The
end result will make a generic Society self-defeating and its
purposes unattaiacd. Many people will still find the cost of
generic brands tough to meet. while those people with more
money will be able to buy the higher quality generic brands.
Morevcr, at the same time the overall quality of products
will probably be lower and cause more dissatisfaction. since
the prices of generic products will tend to be more stable,
even at higher prices, increasing the quality of the product
will not be in harmony with the firm's goal of maximization
of profits.

Call me conservative'ifyou wish, but i tend to think that
‘ expensive" or diversiﬁed brands tend to coexist very well
on the market with the new arising generic or department
store brands that can now be found in most industries. For
the cost and simplicity conscious consumer, llicrc is the
generic brand(s). and for the quality conscious consumer.
there arc the diversified brands.
it is apparent that a generic society would create more
problems than it would solve. Sure choices present more
complexity. maybe even more cost. but it is well worth the
price!
— Steven Bushker
