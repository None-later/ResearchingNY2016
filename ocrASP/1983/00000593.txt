(cPS) Student demand for certain career-
oricnted courscs has outstripped collcgcs'
ability toeprovlde them, and soon only top
students may be able to get into them,
educators around the country report.
“We have students back for a fifth year
because they haven't been able to get all their
required courses." saysfaculty chairman at
West Virginia University. Harold Kidder.
To cope with student demand for business
courses, the University of llllnols’ business
school now only lets In freshmen with high
grade point averages. “Students admitted
. this year are no longer guaranteed that they
will be able to graduate in certain majors,"
-adds~David Sprecher. provost of the Univer-
sity of California-Berkeley. Cal no longer
will allow students to declare majors in
business economics, communications, com-
puter science. ‘economics and certain
engineering specialties.

About a third of the student body at the
University of Nebraska-Omaha were affected
by class closings this fall. according to a poll
taken by the student government there.

Nevertheless. says Jack Peltason of the
American Council on Education in
Washington. D.C.. “It would be misleading
to say thousands of students aren’t getting an
education because courses aren't there. We
have many problems. but that’s not a major
one." The problem does seem less severe at
private colleges, but a wide variety of public
campuses are having trouble hiring enough
professors to teach the “meal ticket" courses
and ﬁnding ways of moving money from less-
popuiar courses.

“We just don't have as much ﬂexibility as
we would like," says Warren Haffncr,
registrar at Penn State. “It’s difficult when
you're working with human resources."

"There simply has been a boom in
business, computer science and some
engineering areas." says Kathy Jones, lowa
State's assistant registrar. “The demand is
growing faster than the ability to fill it." To
fill it, universities must compete directly with
private industries for computer scientists and
engineers.

AAAAA-

.Egmand skyrocketing for job-

Fewer people are going into teaching.
however. A recent study by the Association
for Computing Machinery. a national com-
puter industry information center. found
that only l3 percent of its members stayed in
education after graduating. The study also
found that half the grads make
330,000-350,000 a year, while 27 percent of
them make more than $50,000. By contrast,
college faculty members generally get starting
salaries between $20,000 and $30,000.

Schools are ﬁnding that to attract anyone
at all to their high-demand departments. they
have to pay more that 330.0(1). When they
do, the new recruits earn more than veteran
faculty members in other departments, a
situation that causes morale problems. “We
haven't been cutting dollars for faculty. but
we haven't been able to keep pace with the in-
crease in salaries," laments Vernon Zimmer-
man, dean of the College of Commerce and
Business Administration at Illinois. “Our
money just doesn’t buy as much." Zimmer-
man used to hire beginning accounting in-
structors for $20,000.

“In the next year," he says, "it will be
$36,000 to $38,000. if we don't pay it. other
schools or industry will hire our people. The
crosron of our faculty comes because the
same number of dollars won't buy as many
teachers." Illinois, he says. has lost 12 facul-
ty positions over the past five years because it
can't fund them.

“We just don't have the faculty or the
classroom space" to accommodate all the
students who want to take the “meal ticket"
courses, Berkeley's Sprcchcr says. “And we
don't have the faculty because we don't have
the money. The severity of the problem is
new because of the time frame over which it
was created,” hc observes. “In the past, in-
terest in certain majors developed gradually.
But interest in these subjects has grown up
over a period of three or four years. We
haven't had time to find facilities and recruit
faculty.”

Pcltason thinks facilities and lack of equip-
mcnt may be one of the most important
reasons schools can’t create enough course

blems are serious in science classes." he says.
“If laboratory equipment is old-fashioned or
obsolete, that affects courses."

For whatever reasons; equipment. faculty
shortages or some combination of the two;
J.D. Connor of the Association of College
Registrars and Admissions Ofﬁcers ﬁnds
“many schools are having to evaluate their
course offerings in terms of volume."

Some are doing more rc-evaluating than
others. Private colleges, which are generally

oriented coarses'

dowment funds, seem less drastically affected
by the shift in course demand. But public col-
leges in depressed areas are having probably
the worst time coping. West Virginia Univer-
sity, for example. has lost 105 faculty

members in the past year, largely because it

didn’t have the money to offer competitive
salaries. Kidder says. West Virginia's course
shortages, moreover. run deeper than the
“meal ticket” classes, he adds. The school
has had to cancel classes in such basic
freshmen courses as algebra. chemistry,
psychology and English composition because
