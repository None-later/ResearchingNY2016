. Berkeley, CA
(cps) ~ By all rights, Mike Wein-

" traub should be suffering a special
’ kind of hell. .

For Welntraub has the unlikely
job of heading the University of
' California-Berkeleychapter of the
College Republicans. and ﬁnding

1 some way to organize a meaningful

student vote for the Republicans

‘ even as the Democrats hold their

national convention in nearby San
Francisco. _

But Weintraub is happy. Hts
group has money in the bank. about

' -l00 members signed up, a visible
bon~campus campaign. and

reasonable hopes of doubling his
membership as he gears up for
1984.

The Young Democrats chapter,
meanwhile, can muster 20 students
on a good day-is a little short of
money. and worries about “con—
stricting" people if it tightens its
organization's structure.

So it is going around the country
as the two mainstream student
political groups prepare for the
1984 presidential campaign in this
season of lining up volunteers and
registering voters.

“Our people are very excited and
raring to go.” says Jack Abramol‘l‘.
president of the College
Republicans National Committee in
A Washington, D.C.

“The Democrats." he adds. “are
constantly killing each other with
internal strife."

‘ While "strife" may he too strong
a word, the Young Democrats
group does ltave to balance the feel-
ings'of students who may like dif-
,.-?ferent Democratic candidates.

the Young Dem's' national presi-
dent. “None of the candidates is
really monopolizing the student
vote. though. l’d have thought one
of them would have by now. But
there is no student candidate, no
one who has really touched the
hearts and minds of students across
the nation."

At Berkeley. for example. Young
Democrats Vice President Ram
Cogan, is for Hart. but carefully
avoids driving Mondale. Glenn and
other candidate supporters away by
calling his group “non-partisan."

“If you make it less formal."
Cogan explains of his group, “peo-
ple will be less intimidated. You can
still have a good time doing it."

The Republicans. by contrast. are
"sometimes too organized," Wein-
traub says. While adding that
members can work for any can-
;lidatc during the primaries, Wein-
traub doesn‘t scctn to doubt tltat
Ronald Reagan will be lltc
Republican notttinec.

“We clearly have unity."
Abramol‘f adds.

The Republicans are spending
their time until the nominee is pick-
ed registering voters — Abramot‘t‘
hopes to sign up a million
Republican students voters by next
November — and raising money.

The College Republicans at
Berkeley charge their members
$3.50 a year in dues, of which 75
cents goes lo the state organiuttion.
They also have run small-scale

have gottcn donations from “pro-
tninent local Republicans." and are

Wcintraub says.

The Young Democrats charge

and get 75 cents from the national
Democratic organization for each
person they get to register as a
Democrat. Cogan says.

.The Republican tactics clearly
have been more successful in sign-
ing up and keeping members.
Grogan claims the Young Dems
have about 250 campus units on-
tionwidel to which some Lilli

students belong. Abramoff says‘,
there are now l,000 'College'

Republican chapters, with some
l25,000 members.

“We’re the only conservative
political group on campus," Wein-
traub explains. adding that

have a wide assortment of liberal

groups from which to choose.
“Democrats,” Cogan observes.
"aren’t usually that politically en-
thusiastic anyway." - '
But students have always been'
the volunteer backbone of political

_ campaigns, and Grogan believes the

level of student interest in the cam-
paigns is still high.

“Students are always more
(politically) active than youths in
general." she says. "Student ac-
tivism in the sense of volunteerism
is higher than it probably has been
since the sixties. but people don’t
notice as much when we‘re not get-
ting tear gas thrown at us.”

Neither Abramoft‘ nor Grogan
expects any sort of major student

uprising to start attracting tear gas
in the near future. either. '

Abramoff discounts the effects
of last'week's massacre of some 200
Americans in Beirut and‘ the
American invasion of Granada.

“Just about everyone supports
what we’re doing in Lebanon." he
says. “The Granada thing . . . well.
clearly the left will activate itself
and whoop and holler. But i don't
think you'll ﬁnd any Vietnam War
hysteria."

Grogan is more circumspect.
“Right now (those events) are so far
removed. No one really knows what
to think about them yet. I don't
know how they might affect the
campaign." El

Convict causes canoern at UNC

(CPS) Starting in January. a con-
victed killer may be starting classes
at the University of Northern Col-
orado. and UNC President Robert
Dickeson doesn't like it.

Many other college presidents
and campus security officials pro-
bably wouldn't like it either. but
there are probably "thousands" of
convicted criminals out on work:
release progratns on the nation’s
campuses. sttggests Dan Keller.
head of the University of
Louisville's police and the nation-
wide Campus Crime Prevention
Programs.

Dickeson protests that having
Thomas Courtney, convicted last
year of negligent homicide in the
killing of two people, on campus
without being consulted before he
arrives raises “serious questions"
about being able to maintain cam-
pus security.

‘chkeson wants the Colorado
legislature to review all its prison
work-release rules. a process some
corrections officials fear could
defeat the whole purpose of the
work-release program.

UNC found out about
Courtney’s enrollment “through
the media and the campus radio sta-
tion." said university spokesman
Tom Barber. ‘

“Once a person has paid his debt
to society. l‘m not sure it's ap-
propriate” to inform-a school of a .
student’s criminal record, Keller
said. “But when they’re on work-
release. 1 think campus law enforce-
ment should be informed. and i
think the responsibility (for inform-
ing) should be in the corrections
facilities."

Keller adds prison ofﬁcials don't
always want to tell schools about
work-release students because it

might hurt the prisoner's re-
integration into society.

“Convicted felons don’t have

many rights." agreed Darrel'

Semler. an attorney with the Na-
tional Organization on Legal Pro-
blems of Education, “but they do
have rights of privacy. if you did
tell (administrators) about these
prisoners, you’d violate their
privacy rights."

But Keller also points out that “a
lot of students. including these peo-
ple. are often employed by colleges
in sometimes rather sensitive areas"
where valuables are stored, drugs
may be kept, or even in dorms.
where people are often vulnerable.

Most campus police forces. he
said. don't have the facilities to
screen the criminal records of all the
students their colleges may be
employing at any one time.
