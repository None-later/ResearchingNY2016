'(AP) Telephone companies nationwide are
asking for arecord $6.7 billion worth of pro-
posed rate increases. but state regulators have
been turning down many more requests than
they're approving” I

A survey by,the Ass'pclated Press, con-
ducted over the past three weeks, revealed the
huge number of requests ﬁled by either’Bell
System companies or Independent phone
companies, such as afﬁliates of the GTE
Corp. ‘

But the survey also found that some

telephone companies are having a hard time
winning their cases. Figures compiled by the

Federal Communications Commission and .

the American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
show that as of Oct. 13, state commission:
‘ had rejected 62 percent of the Bell System

rate boost proposals they had reviewed.
If that pattern of authorizing only 38 per-

cent of what is requested holds up, con-
sumers would face roughly. $2.55 billion in
local telephone rate increases in addition to
the $1.5 billion already cleared this year.
The‘S6.7 billion figure tabulated through
the survey is solely for local rate increases
and does not include proposed “access
charges" or other fees tied to the provision of

long-distance service. either interstate or in- ‘

trastate.

The rate increases are defended by
telephone executives as essential to reﬂect
fasterbdepreclation of equipment; to earn
larger profits to attract investors. and to shift
to more 'efficient pricing— charging
customers on the basis of use, just as is the
case with natural gas or electricity.

"With the removal of subsidies from our
industry, it’s really important that our prices
be based~ on our costs— that the individual
services pay their own way," says Tom

Leweck, a spokesman for General Telephone
of California. which has a $221.1 million rate
boost pending. . '

Following orders of the Federal Com-
munications Commission, every local phone
company In the country has proposed to
begin levying a $2-a-month access fee on con-
sumers next year. That fee would be paid by
all consumers to help replace subsidies for
local service that are now collected through
interstate long-distance rates.

The interstate access fees will cost con-
sumers an estimated $2 billion in 1984.
Legislation is pending in Congress to block
the access fees. .

The legislation, however, would not pre-
vent local telephone companies from pursu-
ing their local rate increases or “intrastate ac-
cess fees—" monthly fees that are levied to
replace subsidies contained in long-distance
rates for calls that don't cross the boundaries
of a state. ' ,

The AP survey and data obtained from the
Bell System show there are at least 18 states
where local phone companies are proposing
to duplicate the FCC-mandated access fee
with an intrastate fee.

Those requests total some $934 million.
When those proposed fees are added to the
pending rate increases for local service, ex-
cluding the FCC-mandated fee, state
regulators are actually grappling with more
than $7.6 billion in rate boost requests.

Most of the rate increase proposals for
local service, in dollar terms, have been filed

- by Bell System companies and approximately

$5.8 billion is still pending. The GTE Corp.,
the nation's second largest telephone com-
pany, reports its afﬁliates have roughly
$461.3 million in local rate increase requests
pending. The U.S. Telephone Association,
which represents independent telephone com-
panies, says its members had $469.67 million

.pending as of July 31, excluding GTE.

The local service proposals, excluding all
access charges, are not spread evenly. They
range from highs of $1.18 billion in Califor-
,nia, $775 million in New York and $524
million‘in Texas, to $279 million in Ten-

 

nessee, $257 million in Pennsylvania and
$217.33 million in Alabama.

When intrastate access charges are added, '

some of those numbers rise much higher. The
pending rate hike request in Texas, for exam-

ple, jumps from $524 million to $691 million; _

Pennsylvania. from $257 million to $279
million, and Alabama, $217.4 million to $307
million. ' ‘

' In 16 states; Alaska, Colorado, Connec-
ticut, Florida, Georgia, iowa, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hamp-
shire, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode
Island, Vermont and Washington; plus the
District of Columbia, there are no pending
'rate boosts for local service. In most, that's
simply because local regulators granted in-
creases earlier this year.

In some of those states, however, notably
Oregon, Florida, North Carolina, Michigan
and Washington, rate increases tied to in-
trastate access are still before state
regulators.

The effects of the proposed rate boosts, if
granted. would also vary widely depending
upon what type of local service a consumer
takes. The sharpest increases, in some cases a
proposed doubling of rates, will be faced by
consumers who want the right to dial an
unlimited number of local calls each
month— the most common option.

For ex 'nplc. the Paciﬁc Telephone &
Telegrap.’ "x's request in California, if
granted in full, would boost basic rates for
unlimited dialing from $7 a month to $14.50
a month.

In New Mexico. Mountain Bell’s basic
unlimited rates in some towns could jump as
much as $17.64— from $8.25 a month to
$25.89. In Kansas, Southwestern Bcll’s basic
rates would jump from $9.65 a month to
$22.60 a month.

In other states, the proposed increases are
much smaller. In Montana, Mountain Bell's
rates for basic service would rise from $13.45
a month to $17.05 a month. In Utah, the rate
'would rise from $10 to $12.10 a month, and
in ldaho, from $10.63 a month to $12.68 per
month. 1:]

'“Ga y groups
lose battle
for rights

(CPS) In what many consider a
landmark: case in gay student
groups' efforts to gain recognition
as ofﬁcial organizations on private
campuses, a judge has ruled that

' catholic Georgetown University

does not have to recognize gay stu-
dent groups on its campus.

Associate D.C. Superior Court
Judge .1. Sylvia Bacon, in an opi-
nion released 20 months after she
heard arguments in the case, ruled it
would be unconstitutional to force
Georgetown to abide by the D.C.
Human Rights Act of 1977, which
makes it illegal for schools to
discriminate on the basis of sexual
orientation.

Enforcing the act “in this case
places a burden on Georgetown's
free exercise of religion as set forth
In the First Amendment," Bacon
said.

peal the ruling to a higher court.

“There are great grounds for
overturning the decision," asserts
Ronald Bogard, the students'
lawyer. Bacon “offered a rather
bizarre reason (for overriding D.C.
law)."

If the decision does stand, he said
it "suggests that city ordinances
around the nation are powerless
against religious institutions. They
can discriminate, and say that the
law doesn’t apply to them."

The gay groups at Georgetown
sued in 1980 after their year-long
battle to gain ofﬁcial recognition
through normal channels failed.

Getting official recognition
would guarantee them on-campus
ofﬁce space, mailing services. and
the chance to apply for student ac-
tivities funding.

errgetown’s lawyers had
argued that Catholic doctrine views
homosexuality as “gravely evil"
and “morally wrong," and that
recognizing the group would be an
act of apostacy.

“Ofﬁcial subsidy and support of
a gay student group would be inter—
preted by many as an endorsement
of the gay movement." explains
William Schuerman, GU’s associate
dean of students.

to point out economic issues and
burld up the peace movement.
There is broad-based opposition to
arms build-up," he added.
Regarding the invasion of
Grenada, the DSA is “absolutely
Opposed" to U.S. intervention.

Karpatkin saitl that the United‘

States had no business going into
that country. He continued by
stating that “Americans know
