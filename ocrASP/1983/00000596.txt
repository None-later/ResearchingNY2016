This weekend. the Albany State
men's swim team, coming off of
two impressive outings. will travel
across the border to Canada. to
take part in the McOlll Invite-

I. '

‘iéI‘l‘Ie Danes opened their dual
meet season with a strong 73-37 vrc-
tory over Hartwlck. However, the

Danes got off to somewhat of an tn-

auspiclous start. dropping two out

of the ﬁrst three meet events, sand-

wiehing a victory in the loo-yard

freestyle, led by Frank Cawley’s

season best time of ll:24.56. bet-

ween Hnrtwick's two victories.

These two victories for Hartwiek, 1
whose swimming program does not
even come close to the school’s
percnialiy strong soccer program,
were lobe their last. as Albany won
the final 10 events.

The Danes began the onslaught
with perhaps their strongest race of
the day. the 50-yard freestyle, ns
Fred Grecnbnum and co-captain
Bill Meier took first and second,
with impressive times of 123.0 and
:23.3 respectively. It was a great
day for Grecnbaum, only a
fresltman. as he came back later in
the meet to win the lOO-yard
freestyle, again with an impressive

another two time victor. as ltc walk-
ed away with first place finishes in
the ZOO-yard individual medley
(2:ll.26) and the ZOO-yard butterfly
(2:l7.l6). Albany took the lead in
the meet by sweeping the diving
competition, led by freshman sensa-
tion Mike Vardy and Mike Cano.

Freshman Ted Ober became
Albany's third two-time winner on
the day by winning the ZOO-yard
breastroke. after winning the
ZWyard backstroke. The Danes
capped off the meet by winning the
400-yard free-relay, with a team of
Kennedy, Greenbaum, Andres
Morola, and Mike Wright.

Albany's next opponent was New
Paltz. a strong team that finished
far ahead of the Danes at the Great
Dane Relays. Albany knew that
they were in for a much tougher
battle than their previous victory.
"Going into the meet. I was really
looking just for some good races
and good titties," conceded Head
Coach Joe Shore. The Danes did
drop this meet, but through ll of
the first 13 events, they were right Ill
there.

Things started off \‘cry “U” for
the l)an-' 's they opened the meet
with a Victory in the -i()l)-yard
medley relay, with an annt/ing tintc
of 3:53.93, better titan Albany‘s
best time last year. In that race

 

' Greenbautn swam the backstroke,

 

 

 

breast stroke. butterfly. and
freestyle. respectively. There were
many otltcr bright spots for the
Danes.

"Wally" Meier swam his per-
sonal best in the iOO-yard freestyle.
with a time of :50.9. Albany swept
the 200 individual medley. with the
winning combination of Kennedy
and Ober. Kennedy also recorded a
great time of 2: l2.l0 in the ZOO-yard
backstroke. but was just nosed out.
Wright and Meier teamed with Rich
Geiles and Tom Handy to finish
with a good time of :50.4 in the
400-yard free-relay. Coach Shore
also pointed out the improved time
of Scott Geschwcr in the ZOO-yard
freestyle. New Paltz, known for
their good t‘rccslylers. swept all five
of the freestyle events, outscoring
the Danes 40-5 in those races com-
bined. ,

“l tllli very pleased with our per-
formance against New l'altz." said
Shore. He also noted that minus the
freestyle events, the Danes wuttld
have won easily.

'l'omorrow, the Danes will be in
Quebec. for the Ill-team Mc(iil| In-
vitational. (‘anatliun schools are
not as conscientious about

"A little light dlspels a lot of
Darkness!”

The Menorah, kindled at nightfall,
shows that we can light up even a
very dark and frightening world, for "a
Ilttle tight dlspels much darkness. . 

 The Maccabbees were only a
handful and fought agalnst the odds,
but with dedicatlon, faith, and
spirit—they prevailed. . .

We begin on the first night with
only one candle. There are more to
Come. but there Is only one to start
with. Try one Mltzva at a time. ..

 But we grow from day to day.
Yesterday one was enough, but today
we add another one. We should not
remain stagnant, but constantly
increase our observance of Mltzvos
and Jewish life.

 

HAPPY CHANUKAH!

 

Chanukah marks the Jewish
liberation from Greek-Hellenistic
tyranny, domination and influence.
After regaining their physical and
spiritual independence through the
Macabbees. thry found the Temple
awfully neglected. All the oils had
been contaminated except for a
single cruse of oil that could last for
only 1 day. Miraculously, it burned for
eight, thus giving us 8 days of
Chanukah.

The Holiday ls celebrated by
lighting the Menorah, special prayers,
AI Hanlsim, Charlty and Chanukah
Geit, Dreidet and delicious Latkes.

The Menorah is placed at the
window or left doorpost and kindled
at nightfall (except Friday when It is
lit before sundown). One candle is In
on the first night, and an additional
one each successive night.

 

 

Come over for Latkes & Menorah Lighting
This evening Dec.2 starting at 3:45 at
