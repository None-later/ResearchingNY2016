defense as a whole was also very

The Albany State wrestling team will try to
overcome their youthful inexperience when
they go up against highly-ranked Cortland

. and Binghamtot‘t in a triangular meet. tomor-

row afternoon at the University Gym,

The Dane wrestlers will first face Cortland
at 2:00 pm. and Immediately following the
conclusion. will meet Binghamton. The triple
dual meet will start off at I ma. with Cor.
tland taking on Binghamton.

The young Dane Wrestlers are coming off a V

solid performance in their ﬁrst dual meet last
week versus the pet’enially weak RPI squad.
tn the process of routing the Engineers 484.
the Danes only dropped one of the matches.

But Head Coach Joe DcMeo realizes this
year's team is not in the same class as his
previous powerhouse top-I0 ranked squads.
With only two returning starters from last
year back. DcMeo is dealing with a young
team that will be going through a rebuilding
program this season.

“I was happy by the performance against
RPI but we still have an inexperienced team
and we still have a long way to come along,"
said DcMeo.

DcMeo just last week returned from
Europe with Dane wrestlers Andy Seras and
freshman Sean Sheldon, who are both trying
out for the I984 Olympic team along with the
rest of the Adirondack wrestling club, a unit
DcMeo also coaches.

Seras is redshirting this season for the
Danes to concentrate all his efforts to making
the Olympic squad. In this recent Interna-
tional tournament held in Italy. Seras finish-

ed third in his i49-pound weight class. Along
the way he pinned a former world champion
from Poland and also eked out a 3-1 decision
over a European champion from Hungary.
“His chances of making the Olympics are
excellent." said Demeo. who starts in his
fifth year as head coach at Albany State after

12 years coaching Stanford. “Naturally. It
hurts the team because he's been one of the
top wrestlers I've coached. His goal has
always been winning a gold (medal).','
Meanwhile. Sheldon is making an attempt
to do both. trying out for the Olympics while
also wrestling for Albany.

The Dane wrestlers will be facing Cortland at 2 pm. tomorrow and Blnghamton at
8:30 pm. In the triangular meet at University Gym.

  

--Grappiers host Co‘rtland,Binghamt-0n 

According to DcMeo. Sheldon feels he
could handle the two different styles of
wrestling: Gre'coroman — used In interna-'
tional competition — and freestyle — used
only in the U.S.A. '

Tomorrow afternoon. the Danes will not ‘
be necessarily looking for a sweep of their
two ~meets but DcMeo would liketo see some
improvement In the younger wrestlers. If
there Is a chance of a victory. it will be
against Cortland.

For the Danes to beat them. they will need
three pins from their three lighter weight class
wrestlers. junior Dave Averill — the Danes'
leading wrestler—John Balog. and also
Sheldon. If not. Albany will have to come up
with some upsets from his more inexperienc—

. ed heavier weight classes.

“I'm used to the pressure because I’m a
junior" said Averill. referring to the team
relying on him for a pin.“ I guarantee a pin
against Cortland."

Another key match will involve Albany‘s
only senior. Doug Slater. If he could pull off
a victory at the l67 pound weight class. along
with the three needed pins from Averill.
Balug. and Sheldon. the Danes have a shof at
defeating Cortland. according to Demeo.

“If all that happens and the other guys
hang in tough and keep their matches close.
we could win," said DcMeo.

Binghamton will come into tomorrow's
meet noticeably stronger than last year‘s
lSth-rankcd team. '

“They're going to be ranked higher this
year.“ noted DcMeo. “I'd say they'll be
about fifth at the end of the season."

Said Averill: “They're a powerhouse. We
whipped their pants off last year and they're
sttrc looking for revenge." I J
