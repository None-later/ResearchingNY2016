about 75 people — mostly men —
attended a forum in LC 18 Saturday-
attemoon to learn more about it. '
. Everyone has an immune system
similar to “soldiers‘det‘ending our
body against invasion," said Dr.
Steven Caiazza, one of the forum’s
speakers. The immune system

recognizes and destroys alien things

such as bacteria, fungi. and incom-

patible donors. AIDS, however,

suppresses" the immunitysystem,
leading to an increased risk of infec-
tion, said Caiazza. “AIDS is an in-
fection that causes a deficiency," he
said. Patients with AIDS suffer ter-
rible viral infections. Caiazza add-
ed. because their immune systems
stop functioning.

Certain groups of people are
more prone to acquire AIDS.

count for 7i percent of AIDS pa-
tients, according to statistics cited.
by Caiazza. Intraveneous drug
users account for‘ i7 percent, while
Halttans (5 percent), hemophiliacs
(I percent), and others — including
the sex partners of the ﬁrst four
groups (6 percent) — complete the
list, he added.

{‘You get AIDS two ways,"
Catazza said. “Through intimate
sexual contact and through a blood
product of some sort." “You do
not get AIDS through casual con-
tact," he emphasized. "It is not air-
borne. AIDS is conveyed through

‘ Another problem, said Caiazza,
Is that the “signs and symptoms are
very non-speciﬁc." The common
symptoms — including serious
weight loss, fever, Kaposi's lesions,
shortness of breath and diarrhea —

can all be associated with other pro-
belms, he said, but there is no single
telltale sign.

The incubation period averages
iS‘to i8 months, according to
Carazza. During that time ap-
parently healthy people, not yet
showrng symptoms and therefore
not seeking medical help, may
unknowingly carry and transmit
AIDS. Caiazza said he believes
AIDS most probably results from

rather than isolated instances.

State’s south Enddecision
is key to area” revitalizatiOn

 

By Jane Anderson
EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

 

A part of the South End of Albany has
been declared a historic district by New York
State, in a decision which is “a key to the.
revitalization of the South End,“ according
to Carol Sweet, assistant director of the
South End improvement Corporation.
Several student‘interns worked on the pro-
ject, which was in progress for over two
years.

The area that received the certification
“consists of about 21-24 city blocks, south of
the mansions,” said Sweet. The new historic
district is bounded by Morton Avcnuc,
Elizabeth Street. Second Avenue, and Frank
Street, she added. The South End
Grocsbeckville district "is traditionally a
large area." said Sweet. “It includes the Port
of Albany", as well as a large section of the
city below the Empire State Plaza, shc con-
tinned.

The interns who worked with SEIC on the
project dealt mainly with researching the
buildings involved, according to Ivan Steer,
SUNYA history professor and supervisor of
the internship program. Five students were
involved in the project over the past several
years, according to Steer.

“They did the primary background
research" on the historical buckgrottnd of
the buildings in the South End, said Steer.

Beth Newman, now a SUNYA grnduatc,
worked on the research as a graduate intern
during the l98l-82 school year. "I worked

mostly with dating houses around the Schuler
mansion," Newman explained. “I traced the
dates of house deeds, which would indicate
who built and owned a speciﬁc house." she
continued. -

According to Steer, the interns did
research to “find out what types of people
lived in the buildings." The students who
worked on the project “went back to 1880 to
find the records" on the inhabitants of the
houses, he said. “They (the interns) used city
directories," which list occupants by street

addresses, and “city assessment forms, which
they used to determine age and ownership"
of the buildings, Steer said.

“Mitch of that area was of German na-
Iionality," Newman said. “They were work-
ing class immigrants," she added.

“Each of the houses (in the new historic
district) is at least 50 years old and con-
tributes to the character of the district," ex-
plained Sweet. “The buildings are of modest
style," Sweet said. “They are more of a type
built for immigrants, not for speculators.
They are mostly row houses," she said.

SEiC took over the project in l98l, after it
‘had been in progress since l979, said Sweet.

According to Sweet, the certification “will
allow investors to invest in the district and to
receive tax benefits for income purposes."

The students worked on the project
through the History Department's course
“Special Projects in History", HIS 499/599,
according to the History Department.

“It was interesting work," said Newman.
"i got a great deal out ofit," she added. l'l

Speaker addresses racism problems at caucus

 

By C ine Reffelt

STA/"F ll 'RITIER

 

President Ronald Reagan was charged as
being “potcntialiy dangerous" and New
York City Mayor Ed Koch as being “racist”
'by Angelo Dclforo, assemblyman for the
black and Pucrto-Rican legislative caucus
during a lecture Saturday night.

“It is clear in United States,“ contended
Dclforo. “that the crucial strain of racism is
that white people have been thought to be
more equal than non-white people.“

This problem has led to the question of
war and peace, commented Dclforo. Racism,
he said, leads to the ability in some to kill
people more easily, “and by using slung
terms like ‘.lztps,' ‘Gooks,’ ‘Ricans,' it just
adds to the tension.“ He claimed “this all
points to institutional racism which says
anyone can then go out and kill someone
because they don‘t like you or act like you."

Dclforo lhcn discusscd political catn-
didutcs, including Ronald Reagan and Jesse
Jackson. “Reagan is a very dangerous Presi-
dent,“ Dclforo said, “and hc is leading up to
the most dangerous lime in twenty years with
the build up of nuclear weapons."

Although Dclforo has not endorsed
Jackson as 11 candidate, he said he secs the
Reverend as an important figure. “His long
term impact on the political system, with
rcgnrd to the social issllcs hc plans to raise,
will he very important. It will involve people
who would nornntlly not get involved in the
political process (minoriticsl," he added.

Dclforo also spokc on other current issues,
including the cornpclcncy of Ncw York ('ity
Mayor lid Koch. Koch, Dclforo :tsscrtcd, “is
a rite t. He does not represent everyone in
his district as best he can." llc added that
“Koch is not a lcntlcr. llc docs not try to
solvc all the people‘s problems. He has writ-
ten otn hull of our city, an nct which is
dangerous In socicly." Dclforo said he is
recommending “K0clt'\ dclhroncrncnt. Let's
see to it that he isn‘t around next year.“

Dclforo also \ltcsxcd Ihc llscs ol' participa-
lion and voicing of opinion in order to get
things done. "Don’t just curse Reagan and
Koch," he declared. “lnkc some positive
uciton in order to wipe out the negative

 

 

He continued by saying that “it is
necessary to orguni/c to be an cl'l‘cctivc voice.
Remember, wc‘rc not it close club as a rut-
tion. (let your points across by coming
together as a group. in time, your goals will
be reached."

Dclforo also commented on the tuition in-

crease at SUNY last year. He said he did not
agree with N.Y. Governor Mario Cuorno's
‘ "' of the SUNY budget. Dclforo
stressed that “the only way to prevent any
future problems is to get logchtcr and stip-
prcss any tuition increases."

Creating a society where all individuals can
live together was stressed by Dclforo.
“Create a society where we can all live in
peace together, and provide opportunities for
poor, lower clnsscs, in order that they too will
have the opportunity to live up to the
American Dream of happiness," he added.

Dclforo said he believes that within the

Directories half done

The University Directories are still not in,
two weeks after the deadline. Assistant

“This is lhc lnlcst \vc‘vc cvcr lutd it conic

According to Chcsin, the “firm doing it
had sales problems“ because thcy had never

(,‘hcsin said that “the directory is half

been doing production moved without giv-

“We hope to have the directories by
