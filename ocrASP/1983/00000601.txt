New Dutchess eate

 

‘ By Christine Reffelt

STAFF WRITER

At the new on-campus restaurant
The Dutchess only the name is ex-
pensl've. according to people who
have eaten there.

‘The Dutchess'. formerly ‘The
Mouse Trap'. has been more suc-.
cessful than its predecessor due to
the different atmosphere projected.
according to Lester J. Hynes. direc-
tor of Campus Center Cash sales.
“The customer counts kept sinking
at the Mouse Trap" said Hynes.
"so we felt it was time for a total
change."

The main reason for tire decline
of customers at the Mouse Trap was
due to waning intrcsts. said Hynes.
The change in drinking age accor-
ding to Hynes also led to less
customers. because the Mouse Trap
was a wine and cheese restaurant.
The Dutchess however, is much less
formal. leading to a more successful
turnout. Hynes added. “The Dut-
chess is not formal or expensive" he
explained. "and it is a leisurely
place to eat dinner. The atmosphere
is also pleasant. since there is music
playing in the background" he add-
ed.

E. Norbert Zahm. General
Manager of University Auxiliary
Services . agreed with Hynes.
stating that I"The Dutchess is a
great concept. The Mouse Trap
concept was not going well. and the
majority of students wanted a
change." Zahm continued. saying
that the menu and the prices were
put together with the students in
mind. "It's what the students asked
for" he added. “after they ﬁlled
out a poll given last year." The poll
included questions regarding exact-
ly what type of restaurant students

would enjoy and eat at on campus.
“The Dutchess was a result of the
findings from the poll" Zahm said.

The only problem said Zahm.
again agreeing with Hynes. is the
advertising success (or lack of it).
Not enough students know about
The Dutchess. Zahm explained.
"mainly because there" just hasn't
been enough said about the
restaurant. Once we catch people's
eye. The Dutchess will hopefully get
more recognition."

Zahm stressed. however. that
The Dutchess is doing well. "We're
a bit behind the expectations for
this time in the semester" he stated,
“but nevertheless. students who
have been there like it very much.
and the feedback has been very
positive.“

Larry Posncr. an on-campus stu-
dent. noted after eating at The Dut-
chcss that “it's a nice change of
pace. and mttch better than UAS.
The food is very good. and the
prices weren't that bad." Peter
Seirafi. also an on-campus student.
commented that “if it's not your
mother. it's got to be The
Dutchess!"

Ben Lido. a sophomore, com-
mented that "The Dutchess was
.very enjoyable. The atmosphere
was very nice. and the prices were
moderate." He went on to note that
the restaurant is a convenient place
to go on a Friday night. because it is
on campus. “It's a nice. casual
restaurant with good and tasty food
in generous portions“ he added.

There is a wide selection of food
to choose from. stated Hynes. in-
cluding club sandwiches (54.10).
omelettes ($3.l0). steak ($3.95) and
assorted salads ($2.75).

in addition. there are chicken
wings ($2.75). onion rings (Sl.75).

potato puffs (“.35). and a corn-
binatlon basket. including fried
zucchini. mushrooms and onion
rings ($2.75) “which was
excellent." according to Lido.
Although The Dutchess is doing
moderately well. averaging 70 peo-
ple each Friday night. “we only
have half the customer count we
will need to' be entirely successful"
Hynes stated. While advertising in

the ASP has helped customer tur-
notit somewhat. word of mouth has
shown to be most successful. “it's a
slow way to build the customer
count" said Hynes, “but in the long
run I'm confident it will be the best
method of advertising" hr It-d.
The Dutchess also h s the
campus center option meal card
plan. said Hynes. so any student
can eat there at discount prices. Dif-

ferent specials will also be planned
for next semester, and new ideas are
currently being worked out. Hynes
explained. The main consensus then
from people who have eaten at The
Dutchess is to check it ottt. When
asked if they liked The Dutchess. a
group of students leaving tltc
restaurant exclaimed. "Try it,
you'll love it!" and you can't go
wrong with advice like that! t 1

University gets grant increases

By Alicia Cimhora
stun-- WRITER
________.___..____

The Office of Research at
SUNYA reported the highest att-
nual dollar amount ever for educa-
tional research during the last fiscal
year. Frank DiSanto. grants coor-
dinator in the university’s office for
rcscarch. reports that the more than
$l6 million dollars received through
grants and other awards is expected
to increase in the next fiscal year.

According to DiSanto. the
university has begun expanding its
alternatives in regard to sources of
revenue to fund its research pro-
jects. it has increased the number of
applications submitted and begun
exploring non-traditional funding
sources such as industry and inter-
national government.

The 516.675.347 awarded in
1982-83 shows a 23 percent increase
over the previous year’s total of
$13.54l.0l8. Over the past to years
the dollar amount received has
more than tripled said John W.
Shumaker, Vice-President for
Research and Educational Develop-
ment. -

About 60 percent of the revenue

received in l982-83 came from
federal sources such as the National
Science Foundation. and the
Department of Defense. [)i Santo
said. while about 20 percent came
t'rotn the state. The remaining 20
percent is comprised of grants
received through philanthropic
organiztions. industry. and private
foundations. such as the Ford and
Rocket'ellcr Foundations.

According to Shumaker, the
trend toward increased awards of
research finds is a direct reflection
on the quality of the faculty here at
SUNYA. He said that "our faculty
is on the leading edge of scientific
and research work." and that the
establishment of the university as a
leading research institution attracts
bettcr faculty. This benefits
undergraduates in that it attracts
scholars who are also teachers. he
added.

Shumaker claimed that the exten-
sive screening process involved in
the awarding of grants is also an in-
dication of the quality ofthe faculty
and the research being done here.
These research projects include the
economic effects of acid rain. and
the use of computers in junior high

school classrooms.

in many cases the tlccision to
award a research grant is busctl on
an “objective pccr-rcvicn" ol' the
importance ot' the subject tttuttcl.
wltcthcr it is rcttsonztltly rlcsigncrl
and budgeted. and if the tcscrtrclrcr
is qualified. Shrtnrttkct said. “the
formality of tire screening process
differs from agcttcy to agency." he
said, "witlt federal tlgcncics Inning
the ntost stringent t‘cqltitctncnts."

The increased I’L‘SL‘illL‘it ctrpucity
of the university will also have an
effect on the local ccottomy.
reported Shumaker. Part ol' the
money received frorn grants is used
to hire people and pay their salaries.
Supplies and materials are also pur-
chased in the Albany area.

Looking ahead to the next fiscal
year. DiSanto expects that with tile
increase in the number of grant tip-
plications there will be an increase
in the grants awarded. “Wc c\pccl
that the dollar total in grants will
rise again next year. bccntlsc ol‘ the
increase in applications and bcctnrsc
of several large contracts that have
been awarded but not signed." t ‘t

The effects of acid rain on both the natural
and man-made environment has complex and
potentially disastrous consequences for our
environment according to a NYPlRG
publication.

Acid rain is caused by airborne emissions
of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides which

jor areas such as fish extinction. reduced
forest productivity . reduced crop yields,
contamination of fish and drinking water and
accelerated corrosion and erosion. According
to NYPlRG. acid rain is one of the pres
eminent problems of New York state's en-

vironment and it has to be dealt with in the I

very near future," said Herrick. He stated
that the major problem facing NYPlRG is
that the acid rain issue is a national issue

 

“People have to start waking up to the
fact that what they’re doing is affecting
people all over. ”

originate primarily from mineral smelters,
fossil fuel fired generating stations and inter-
nal comubstion engines which are prevalent
in the Mid-West. according to NYPlRG.
These emissions combine with moisture in
the air to create dilute acids and can travel
thousands of miles. Consequently the
precipitation in most of the eastern United
States is 10 to 100 times more acidic than is
considered normal. Tltc damage from acid
rain has long tcrnt effects for both people
and the crtvironmcnt. According to Paul
Herrick. NYPIRG project coordinator.
"We‘re on the ecological edge and soon it
may be irreversible." ltc explained.
NYPIRG notes that acid rain has been pro-
vcn to have dctrimctttal effects in many ma-

which needs to be solved on a national level.
“Our inﬂuence is only in New York." be ad-
ded. ‘

Negative effects of acid rain have already
been documented. much of which has occur-
red in the Adirondack region of New York.
There are reportedly 212 takes already
“dead” and 256 others which are being
threatened. citcd NYPIRG.

The conversion of US. power plants from
oil to high sulphur coal. and the plan of the
Reagan administration to relax the existing
emission standards threatens to heighten the
acid rain problem. according to NYPIRG.

Governor Ctromo and a Senate committee
are prcsctttly working on a bill to decrease the
tonnage of toxic emissions of sulphur and

to million ton reduction. while Cuomo is
pushing for a l2 million ton reduction. Pro-
ject coordinators explained that NYPlRG at
one time was asking for a 20 million ton
reduction. They also stated that they are
presently pushing for the installation of
“scrubbers” into power plants in order to
reduce emissions into the air. Efrem Kann. a
NYPIRG project coordinator involved in the
acid rain issue says that “people have to start
waking up to the fact that what they're doing
. is affecting people all over."

Harry Hamilton. former chairman of the
Department of Atmospheric Science and pre-
sent Dean of Undergraduate Studies recently
appeared on a PBS program which addressed
the problem of acid rain. The program.
I‘3—2-l Contact" is sponsored by the
Children's Television Workshop and is aimed
at an elementary and junior high school au-
dience to encourage interest in math and
science.

The show was done on location on
Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondacks and
showed the negative effects on the forests
and water there. Hamilton stated that "when
the impact of acid rain was thought to be on
just fish in remote areas it was okay. but now
that the effects are showing up in the retarda-
tion of agriculture it becomes a new
ballgamc." He further commented that "we
may be causing our society a great deal of
trouble 25 years from now."

The U.S. National Academy of Sciences
concluded in a Sept. l98l report that cott-
tirtttcd emissions of sulphur dioxide and
nitrous oxides at current or higltcr rules “in
the face of clear evidence of scriorrs hazard to
human health and to the biosphere" will be
“extremely risky.” l I

Psych Department receives recognition

 

By Amey Adams
.\"I.-tl’l "NI/TR

 

A recent survey sponsored by the National
Academy of Sciences. found that the
SUNYA Psychology Dcpttrtmcnt had the
mast improved psychology program in New
York. and one of tire most intproved in the
country. according to Department Chair
Gordon G. Gallup. .lr.

“I think it‘s the best in the SUNY system."
Gallup said.

Titc Psychology Department has received
national and intcrnationtrl recognition for its
clinical research on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.
and on Biofeedback for use in blood pressure
and headache reduction. Gallup noted. He
added that "the magnitude of the research
effort is very. very lttrge."

There are thirty-two full-time faculty and
100 doctoral students in the psychology
department. Gallup explained. He estimated

tltat betwccn 20 and 40 experiments are car-
ried out each year. Thc cxpcrimcnts include
ilppiiL‘d clinical t'cscarch. research on human
mcmory. information processing. clrildrett.
animals. and fetal alcohol syndrome. to
ttatnc a few. Some research is federally fund-
ed. he said. “We received $l.2 million irt
grant research last year." Gallttp said.

According to Gallup. tltc validity of the ex-
periments depends on several factors. Some
can be generalized beyond the laboratory.
others cannot.

"Some experiments trrc designed to answer
theoretical questions. and may not solve
practical problems. It dcpcnds on the type of
experiment. and the objective. Some clinical
research in headache reduction. phobia
management. weight reduction. and smoking
cessation all rcvcnl data that can be generaliz-
ed and produce long ternr benefits." Gallup
explained.

'All rescurch projects involving humans and

animals must pass tltc approval of the cam-
pus lnstitutional Review Board (IRB). Gallup
said. The IRB has been reviewing proposals
on human research for the past six years. and
this year another review board was set up to
examine proposals on animal research. he ad-
ded.

“Thcrc always was a committee to review
animal research. but it's tnorc structured and
more active than it used to be. All programs.
ittclrtding when animals are used in class.
must be approved." said Dr. Jeffrey M.
Cohen. Human Subjects Research Officer.
According to Coltcn. there are about too
studies condrrctcd each year. but only a small
proportion are experiments. “The committee
reviews more than 300 proposals a year. less
than one-third of which are experittrents." he
said.

prust fund proposed
to help combat the
effects of acid rain

Secaucus, NJ
(AP) Gov. Thomas H. Kean says his pro-
posal to create a $5 billion fund to attack
acid rain at its source appears to have sup-
port among Northeastern governors and
the American public. '

He said he would propose during a
meeting of the Coalition of Northeastern
Governors Monday that an Acid Rain Trust
Fund be established to loan industries the
money to install equipment to reduce emis-
lsions that create acid rain.
. Acid rain is formed when sulfur diox'dc
emitted by industries and utility ' pf r
'plants mixes with water in the atmosp e
.to make sulfuric acid. which is returner. to
the earth in rain.

Kean, the host of the two-day couferent.
called to discuss acid rain. said he sent his
proposal to the six other governors in the
conference and received a favorable initial
reaction. He added he hopes to receive con-
gressional support for the plan.

“Acid rain is having a devistating effect
on the entire Northeast." Kean said Sun-
day. “Its real effects are in destroying
ponds and lakes. crops. vegetation and even
,in eroding pttblic buildings."

Tire economic losses caused by acid rain
"are already high and will continue to
,mount unless strong action is taken." Kcan
‘suid. '

The other governors attending thc open-
ing session of the conference Sunday in~
clttdcd Micltacl Dukakis of Massachusetts.
J. Joseph Garrahy of Rhode Island.
William O'Neill of Connecticut and John
Strntttttt of New Hampshire. Gov. Mario
Cttorno of New York was schcdttlcd to at-
tcnd Monday and Gov. Dick Thornburgh
of Pennsylvania. who is in China. sent a
representative.

Speaking in New York City. Cuomo said
that tltc federal government should get
tnore involved in solving the problem of
ttcid rain and that the fight against it should
be funded by taxes on toxic emissions and
generation of electricity.

"Acid rain is a menace," he said at an
'impromptu news conference in Manhattan.
“It is cotttaminnting our waters. it is ruin-
ing our forests. destroying our health — in
ways that are stunning  the numbers are
extraordinary. It is a national problem.
"We don‘t produce all the sulfur diox-
idcs that are punishing llS.  it requires a
;national solution. You need to fund this
rcmctly. You need a technology to clean
this up.

"You can tax the generation  of elec-
tricity in the northeast or you can tax the
emissions. mostly midwcst. I suspect what
tltc governors are going to say is let‘s do a
combination of botlt to spread lhc burden.
“So. we call for a national program to
fight acid rain funded by both emission tax
and gcncrttting tux.  Thcrc will also be .t
strong movctncnt tntrtlc. l‘tn sure. by (im. -

fuels and through about $7 billion in bonds.

continental states would bc tnxcd. Kean
said. adding that the levy would most likcly‘
be passed on to tttility customers in the
form of higher rates.

Robert Hughcy. New Jersey environmen-
tal commissioner. said utility customch us-
ing 500 kilowatts of electricity a month
would pay “at most 75 cents a month"
rrnder the governor's plan.

Kean said the intent of his program ts to
spread the cost of controlling acid rain
throughout the cottntry rather than asking
Midwestern and Southern states. where
ttrany fossil fuel-burning plants are located,
to shoulder the burden alone.

"It recognizes that everybody should
share the cost." Kean said. "New .lcrsc.
land other states who have already done the
job of reducing sulfur emissions would not
be hit as hard. The burden would fall more
heavily on those who have more to do."
Kenn added that since 1968. New Jersey
has reduced sulfur emissions by 70 percent.
