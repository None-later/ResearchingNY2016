Faced with no working projectors
of their own, an incomplete officer
board. and an image that the only
movies they show are the ones they
want to see. the International Film
Group is struggling to remain one
of SUNYA’s major film groups as
the group enters its thirtieth year.

IFG President Deborah Sarria
said that the biggest problem facing
tlte group is that out of four projec-
tors owned by the group not a single
one is in working order. Sarria said
that she had no idea how old the
projectors were because lFG has no
records at all on them. Sarria refus-
ed to even speculate on the
machines' ages.

Sarria said that out of the four
projectors she inherited when she
was elected president in September.
two were designed to be back-ups.
Two attempts were made to gel the
four projectors fixed, first at
SUNYA's Educational Com-
munications Center, which Sarrin
said sometimes does minor repairs
for the group. and then at State
Photo in Stuyvesant Plaza. State
Photo said the projectors were not
worth the cost of reconditioning,
according to Sarria.

Student Association officials
agreed that IFG needs new projec-
tors. SA President Rich Schaffer
said that buying new equipment “is
the only way we can keep the group
going." and that he was “definitely
committed to seeing the group re-
main alive."

SA Controller Adam Barsky
figured it would cost around $2,000
to buy another projector and men-
tioned the possibility of buying two
projectors now since it would “save

money in the long run.“ He said the
money could come out of either
SA's general fttnd or emergency
spending line, but that he would
rather see it come from the
emergency line. “i see no reason
why they shouldn’t get it (a projec-
tor) as soon as possible," he stated.

Rich Golubow, SA Director of
Student Programming said it was
imperative that IFG get a new pro-
jector soon. He said an estimate
had been received that one new pro-
jector would cost $2,900. but that
existing power packs and lenses
would be compatible with the new
projector, and so a whole new

system would not have to be pur- .

chased.
“They need a projector and they

need it as soon as possible,"
Golubow said. He did not believe it
would be possible to get two projec-
tors this year. but that a second one
might be budgeted into next year's
equipment line.

According to Sarria and
Golubow. IFG is currently renting
projectors frotn the C'ampus'Center
Audio-Visual department. As part
of the rental agreement IFG must
hire techinicians at $5.25 an hour,
Golubow noted. Sarria and lFG
treasurer Rhoda Spira both main-
tained they could do a better job
than the technicians, and Golubow
said that Sarria and Spira often had
to teach the technicians how to
operate the machines the night of
the showing.

Sarria also mentioned that only
two of the group’s three ofl'icers’
positions have been filled since
almost the beginning of the
semester because the vice-president
withdrew frotn the University short-
ly after being elected in September.

Both Sarria and Spirit have been
working to try and upgrade lFG's
image. “Past officers just brought
films they wanted to see." said Sar-
ria, and she noted that this year
they were trying to “bring films
that are different and interesting"
to SUNYA.

Sarria said that letters were sent
to all SA recognized groups asking
for their suggestions for films and
offering to co-sponsor a film. Most
of theletters are being followed by

phone calls to group leaders. she
added.

Spira said that IFG “wants to
hear from the people on campus,
we want to know what they want."
She also pointed out that IFG will
co-sponsor a film with a group and
pay for the rental costs as well.
“We can get better rates than other
groups, and they don't pay for it."
she said.

Snrria also referred to the input
of IFG members by saying “lFG
has always had a‘ poilicy that the
members should have a big say in
what is shown." but that problems
develop when IFG shows movies
that only the members are in-
terested in. The present IFG policy
is that a film will be shown only
after the costs are weighed against
the expected attendance a film will
bring in. said Sarrio. Films shown
this semester have included The
Graduate, Casablanca, and Monty
Python and the Holy Grail.

The group tries to bring in films
that aren’t readily accessible to
most people and foreign classics to
the campus, explains Sarria. She
also said that people are - often
afraid to come to a foreign film
because they thought they’d find
the substitles annoying. but both
she and Spira quickly asserted they
weren't. "They don't make a dif-
ference" said Spira.

IFG was founded as an alter-
native to University Cinemas. said
Spira. but she said that the two
groups try to work together. “We
don’t have a direct competition
with UC, or at least we try not to."

UC President Paul Baldino
agreed with Spira. saying that there
was no competition between the
groups and that they try to help
each other out. El
