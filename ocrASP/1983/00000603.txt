The new Homecoming Spirit

'Committee, formed to improve

SUNYA's image, bring about stu-
dent awareness and increase spirit.

‘held its first meeting last Thursday

said Student Association Vice-
President and chair of the commit-
tee Jeff Schneider.

SUNYA can be boring, explained
Schneider, especially in winter when
there are no University-wide ac-
tivities such as Fallfest and Mayfest.
To make campus life more in-
teresting the committee is consider-
ing a number of events including a
winter weekend to accompany the
Feb. 7 men's basketball game
against Potsdam, and, in the
future, reinstating the holiday sing
in which the quads compete for the
strongest show of spirit.

The committee, called for by SA
President Rich Schaffcr, consists of
about 20 students and ad-
ministrators. The first meeting, said
Schneider, was mainly a brainstor-
ming session to discuss ideas and
analyze problems with events held
by other groups in the past. "At
first” continued Schneider. “peo-
ple were pessimistic. but by the ettd
of the meeting people were really
excited."

Schneider added that the com-
mittee would like to channel its cf-
forts and ideas through other on-
campus groups suclt as the in-
tramural program. quad boards.
class council and another group
with similar goals, the Dog Pound.

Bill Moore, head of SUNYA‘s
athletic department,along with
other administrators such as Norb
Zahm (UAS). Karen Empe, and
Barbara Schoonmakcr attended the
first meeting. “Athletics has a lot to
gain from this, especially the
teams" said Moore, adding that h(
feels greater student attendance at
the games may help the players get
more excited about the sport they’re
playing.

According to Schneider the com-
mittee is enthusiastically supported
by many campus groups, including
the Athletic Department, Alumni
Association, Student Affairs,
Residence, UAS. Purple and Gold
Association and SA. “It‘s a terrific

idea and I hope all levels of the
Univeristy will give it support"
commented Howie Woodruff, Area
Coordinator for State and Colonial
Quads.

The main reason for starting the
committee is because of other ef-
forts already in progress. but, as
stated by Schaffer, the committee
wants to organize these efforts by
students. faculty and ad-
ministrators and get them all
“under one roof." He added that
through programming a coor-
dinated effort could bring about
progress.

Many of the ideas being tossed
around now are to regenerate
previous events which have phased
out due to lack of interest,but the
committee will start a forum to get
involvement up again."

Faculty and administrators
should be more involved in student
activities said Director of Student
Programming Rich Golubow. ad-
ding that “there is nothing concrete
right now but the committee is
looking to focus in on the Potsdam
game."

According to Schneider, the
primary focus is on increasing spirit
and attendance at basketball games
but attempts will be made to in-
crease awareness of the music

department. not only in terms of its
pep band but also other aspects of

the music department as well. ,

Schal‘fer added that he would also
like to utilize the campus center
more effectively.

“Awareness is a real key. In-
volvement will increase as
awareness increases," commented
Bob Helbock. Chair of Central
Council. He suggested inter-
collegiate athletics Is a good star-
ting point for boosting school
spirit. '

The Dog Pound. an entirely stu-
dent group, has similar aims for in-
creasing spirit but will only gear
itself toward sporting events. This
committee presently consists of
15-20 students but hopes to attract
250 student members to attend the
games. This group, sporting t-shirts
and a cheering attitude will hopeful-
ly attract larger student crowds to
attend the games, explained
Schneider.

Both the Homecoming Spirit
Committee and the Dog Pound
Committee want to increase student
awareness, involvement and spirit
at SUNYA. Schneider invites in-
volvement and suggestions from all
and can be contacted at the SA ol‘-
fice. l i
