ning Sunday,‘ the U.S. Marine base
at the Beirut airport was being shell-
ed by Drusc militiamen with mor-
tars, rockets and artillery that killed
eight Americans and wounded two
others.

The Marine commanders said to-
day the eight Mnrincs appurcntly
were killed by a single artillery shell.

W ‘ 4 the deaths resulted by ac-
cident during a Drusc attempt to
strike at Lebanese army forces.

"We don’t seek hostilities
there." Reagan said. “But we are
going to defend our forces there."

As he made his statement,
Reagan was not yet aware of the at—
tack on the Marines and the eight
deaths. Asked later at a black-tie
reception whether the United States
would retaliate for the deaths.

we are right now returning ﬁre from

tiﬁed.

“I don’t think the policy of
defending ourselves has changed."
the official said, "but we may do it
with more vigor.“

Thc Drusc gunners opcncd l'irc
on Marines at the airport about 12
hours after the U.S. air strike. Onc
White House official said “it would
be logical to assume“ that the
Drusc attack was in response to the
Amcrican air strike.

to pinpoint the sources of the four

port base.

Reagan's policy drew sharp
criticism from some contenders for
the Democratic Presidential
nomination.

“We don’t seek hostilities there,
but we are going to defend
ourselves. ”

—Ronaid Reagan

 

White House officials said
Reagan's declaration of retaliation
grew out of a policy developed in
mcctings last Thursday and Friday
with foreign policy advisers on the
problem of attacks against
Americans in Lebanon. in those
sessions, Reagan approved a
"framework of rcsponsc for any at-
tacks" against the peacekeeping
forces in Lebanon, according to one

Cranston said that “when we are
fired upon, it may be necessary to

places were we invite attack."

Sen. John Glenn of Ohio said the
U.S. government “should exercise
thc ulmost caution and measure our
response to this cxtrcmcly
dangerous situation vcry
cttrcfully." adding that he does not
favor withdrawing U.S. Marincs
“at this time or under these cir-
cumsitutccs."

Scn. Gary Hart ofColorado. said
that "it‘s almost inevitable that
there will bc an escalation of the

Baker said the deaths

The U.S. bombing raid on Syrian
batteries in Lebanon deepens, the
American combat role in the
perilous Middle East while
heightening the potential for a con-
frontation with the Soviet Union.

President Reagan insisted on
Sunday that the United States was
not spoiling for a ﬁght with Syria.
but rather sought only to hpr the
Lebanese government stabilize the
country.

Although be emphasized "we
don't desire" a broader confronta-
tion with Syria —— and that thc bom-
bing of thc anti-aircraft batteries
was in reaction to an “unprovoked
attack on unarmed U.S. rccon-
naissance planes on Saturday — the
show of American muscle could

I955. By then the

done until
Swedish government
Wallcnberg was dead.

In l957. a letter was found that
said Wallcnbcrg was dead and his
body had been cremated. The lot-
tcr, according to chebaugh-
Kcnwryck, was signed by Andrei
Gromyko, the present Soviet
Foreign Minister. who was then a
deputy minister. ‘

“The Russians did not crcmatc
their prisoners and Wallcnbcrg's
name was misspelled," according to
the speaker. "they knew it was
fake. Until Gromyko dies or retires
the Soviet Union will not change
their position on Wallenbcrg."
They would not disclaim the letter
because they would risk dishonor-
ing Gromyko,

During the 19605, the DWCLllSh
government received numcrous
reports from witnesses who said
tltcy had seen Wallcnbcrg alive. said
chcbaugh-Kcnwryck.

The Soviet Union, according to
chcbough-Kcnwryck, has ncvcr in-
dicath why they kcpt Wullcnbcrg.
but it probably has to do with the
cold war. "Thcy probably con-
sidcrcd him an American spy.“

In 1980, after lobbying by two
Hungarian doctors who wcrc saved
as children by Wollcnbcrg, Prcsi-
dcnt Reagan namcd Wallcnbcrg an
honorary citizen of the United
States. Wallcnbcrg is only the third
person in U.S. history to be made
an honorary citizen. said
chcbaugh-Kcnwryck.

In 1983. SUNYA history pro-
fessor Krosby nominated
Wallcnbcrg for a Nobel peace prize.
An international drive, according to
chcbaugh-Kcnwryck, was started
by the Wallcnbcrg Committee of
the United States, to get letters of
nomination sent to Norway.
Nominations from representatives

.Syrla is armed by‘ the Soviet
Union, Its gunners trained by Soviet
technicians. U.S. ﬁring on Syrian
positions. which Reagan and Pen-
tagon ofﬁcials suggested might be
repeated, brings the superpowers
closer to a clash in the Middle East
than they have been since the Yom
Kippur war of 1973.

The Soviets quickly rebuilt the
Syrian forces after they were
humbled by_ the Israelis in Lebanon
last year, but avoided direct in-

volvement in clashes between the.

two countries. If the Syrians are
subjected to U.S. poundings. the
Soviets will have to decide whether
to let their closest Arab ally down
or help Syria ﬁght back. -

a y I

in eleven countrles were sent out,
including one from former Vice-
Presidcnt Walter Mondale.

The Norwegian committee, the
speaker said, indicated that they
would not give Wallcnbcrg the prize
because “they did not know his
mailing address and could not iden-
tify him."

"There is a tendency today to
paint the man as a legend. The pro-
blem is that history has many
legends — many of" them forgotten.
He should be considered a human
being . . . who achieved extraor-
dinary results," chebaugh-
Kenwryck stressed. There is an in-
dication that Wallcnbcrg is still
alive and being well-treated. “He's
more or less living a guildcd life in a
cage."

"JSC-Hillcl is concerned with in-
creasing awareness of Raoul
Wallcnbcrg's cxistcncc." according
to Donna Corwin. Chairperson of
the World .lcwry Committee, “that
is our immediate goal in honoring
the man. I was very pleased with the
turnout. attentiveness, and the in-
formational quality."

“Russians pay attention to
pressure from Americans," accor-
ding to chcbaugh—Kcnwryck. “It
is in their best interest to let him go
in order to make better relations
with Western Europe and
Sweden."

President O'Lcary, who last year
declared Dec. 2 Raoul Wallenbcrg
Day at SUNYA, stated. “This day
is in mcmory of a man who was
declared a U.S. citizen. He saved
many lives. it is appropriate for his
university to honor bravery." The
administration has not taken any
other steps to help Wallenberg, ac-
cording to O'Leary, because it is
not appropriate for the university to
get involved in the political con-
troversy surrounding
