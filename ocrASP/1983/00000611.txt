the “Shallow Wastc Burial," if pro-
pcrly constructed is a safe way of
disposing many forms of waste.

In addition to the infected sur-
face soil. says Ciarfclla. 200 barrels
of radioactive waste were found on
an open field nearby, and were
subsequently identified as belong-
ing to NL Industries.

NYPIRG has. according to
Clarfclla, worked with community
groups. specifically the “Workers
Safety Group," and “Citizens Con-
cerned About NL,” in supporting a
bill proposed by Senator Alphonse
D'Amato. D‘Amato's bi!| called for

the digging up of approximately
52,000 tons of dirt. in a massive

cleanup effort. The arcas to be,

worked on would primarily be the
land surrounding NL’s old loca-
tion, which would include the pro-
pcrty of many local residents.

Last week. NYPIRG set up a
table in the Campus Center to
distribute information on toxic
dumping in New York State, and
specifically Albany County. In just
three days NYPIRG obtained
almost l00 signatures for a petition
to be sent to New York State
Governor Mario Cuomo.

for the Community “Right to
Know" Bill which, according to
NYPIRG, establishes the rights of
citizens to know what types and the
amounts of the toxic chemicals be-
ing used. handled. manufactured or
transported by industries in their
communities. Though the “Right to
Know" Bill was not passed by the
New York State Legislature.
Cuomo, according to Ciarfclla, has
publicly stated that he hopes to
achieve his objectives anyway.
through whatever control over
government departments he has.
NYPIRG hopes to add its petition
to already strong public opinion in
favor of the bill.

Paul Herrick, district coor-
dinator for NYPIRG at SUNYA
points to the New York State super-
fund as an example of a state law
designed to combat toxic waste
dumping. Thc superfund unfor-
tunately, added Herrick, has not
lived up to expectations. Com-
panies are supposed to contribute to
the slate fund based on the volume
of dumping they do. It is difficult.
Herrick noted, to check on com-
panics to make sure they are paying
their fair share. Many times a com-
pany will contract the services of
another to clean up their sites, but
might not inform that company of
all their locations. A company
might dump in the woods, or in a
sewer systemI and as such Herrick
said that checking on thcsc com-
panies is many times next to im-
possible.

There are about l.300 damp sites
,in New York State of potentially
dangerous nature, and, Herrick ad-
ded that of the» 700 officially
recognized by New York State.
three are on the superfund list. Her-
rick explaincd that the superfund is
an incentive to companies to'pro-

duce less waste, as companies pay -

less to‘ the fund if they find alter-
natives to dumping. Many wastes
can be reused and recycled, accor—
ding to Herrick. What is needed,
Herrick said, is a change in the
philosophies companies use to do
business.

Recently, NYPIRG‘s SUNYA

.chnpte'r wrapped' ‘ ‘up‘their‘iciiidm
't'or theacmestei concerning toxic

waste dumping. For next semester,
NYPIRG would like to expend the '
map they made'of Albany County
to include the counties of Schenec-
tady and chssclaer. The map. says
Ciarfella, is really the first one put
together of areas in the capital
district.

In expanding the map, NYPIRG
will once again utilize the informa-
tion obtained from the DEC on the
state level, and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) on the
federal level. D

animal research includes a

“We have to make it as diverse as
