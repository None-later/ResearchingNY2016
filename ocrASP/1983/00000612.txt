University deans propose steps
to improve statewide education

 

By Suzanne Murphy
STIIH’ ll'RITE/t’

In a $20 million education
package sent to the state legislatrtre
last month, the New York State
Cottncil ol‘ Univeristy Deans pro-
posed five specific measures to im-
prove elementary and secondary
edttcation statewide.

The Deans“ suggestions included
a seltolarhsip and grattt progratn for
students interested in teaching
careers. an increase itt teachers'
salaries. and a‘revicw board to
recognize‘otttstanding teachers.

According to Robert Koi't'. cotta-
cil chairman and Dean ol‘ Educa-
tiott at SUNYA, the scholarship
program for students interested in

careers in teaching would be aimed
at students wishing to pursue
master's degrees. The student
would have to tncei certain rc-
qttircmcnts in order to receive
financial help, Kol‘i' explained.

The council stressed improving
teachers‘ salaries. Kol'l' said thttt the
average starting salary for clemen-
Iary and secondary school teachers
is “4.000 tt year. The council sug»
gested tt base salary of $19,000 a
year for teachers “ilil masters
degrees. This would encourage well
trained students to enter tcacltinu.
said Koi'l'. L

The Dctttts‘ program also stressed
the need for the “cstablislttncnl ol'
stringent standards for entry into
the profession. atttl ctttelttlly pltttttt-

ed systems of teacher evalttatiott
attd improvement for currently
employed teachers to maintain high
quality.”

in addition. the cottncil called for
an improvement in the “structure
and dignity" of tire teaching profes-
sion. They suggested a statewide
Acadcttn of Outstanding Teachers.
Kol‘l‘ e\plaincd that this would
“recogtti/c very effective practi-
tiottcrs."

Noting that “lasting educational
change takes place til the local
e\e|.“ the ('oalition ol‘ University
Deans called for the creation of new
Regional Resource Councils.

“'l’hesr' councils would he made
up of representatives from higher
education. business. and school

districts working together to meet
the educational needs of their
regions." said Koi‘i'. “The councils
would be organized around institu-
tions of higher learning in order to
develop experimental programs to
meet these needs.“ he added.

“Just as there is a need to repair
the roads and bridges of the state.
so is it important to come tip with
cdttcation improvements we can at-
i'ord." said Koi'l‘. “It is an invest-
rttettt in the future of the State.” he
asserted. ”

lie explained that the State pays
only 40 percent of the amount spent
on public education. This ranks
New York 35th in the nation for the
amount spent by the state on ptthlic
education. “The council." Kol'l'eX-
plttined. “\tould like to see that
amount at 50 percent."

Currently. New York has a
surplus of teachers. said Koi'i'. but
there are shortages in fields such as
math and science. The Council of

from Dec. 5 - 9

Applications will be available in
the Contact Office and in the 
Student Association Office CC116

“This is our chance to make
the decisions ”

Deans strongly opposes “quick fix"
solutions to those shortages, calling
them “superficially attractive."
Koff said he sees the Deans' pro-
gram as a better. long term solu~
iion.

Some of the short term solutions
Kol‘i‘ denounced were retraining
programs that inadquatcly prepared
teachers for specifice fields, waivers
of teacher certification re-
quirements. and raising standards
in teaching without providing
resources to meet the standards.

The Council. which meets four

times a year to discuss New York '

educational policy, is composed of
Deans of Education off all public
and private universities in New
York which offer research and doc-t
toral programs in education. These
universities include Columbia. Cor~
neli. (‘UNY. Fordhant. l~iot'stra.
NYU. St. John's. SUNY Albany.
SUNY Buffalo. Syracuse. arid
Rochester.
