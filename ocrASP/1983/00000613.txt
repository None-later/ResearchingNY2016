’ discussed risk reduction; saying that

“Sex does not cause AIDS. Sex is
not the culprit." Rather. he said,
sex is a “probable means of
transmission." "Reducing the
number of different sexual partners
definitely reduces the risk of
AIDS," said Quadland. “Be very
careful about what you do with a
person. I encourage people to put
off sex. Find out something about
this person." Quadland also advis-
ed going back to traditional dating.
Quadland clariﬁed the problem,
saying, “This is a health issue, not a
moral issue l'm talking about. We
don't have to give up sex. We have
to be careful about it." He added
that people must think of sex in
terms of moderation and control.
"It's possible to talk about sex.
Many people are afraid to do that,
that it will turn off their partner."
Qundland said he‘s found the 0p-
posite to be true. Quadland advised
his audience to try “any kind of

must assume some responsibility.

Reverend Mills R. Omaly, a
homosexual and AIDS sufferer,
told the audience that “after much
prayer and intensive
psychotheraphy, I felt not only was
it alright to be gay, it was good."

Omaly recounted his experience
of contracting AIDS, saying, “My
lover at the time couldn't deal with
it," adding that he broke up with
his lover, his wife refused to let him
visit their daughter unless he
repented his homosexuality and his
vestry asked him to resign —- which
he did. “Everything that possibly
could go wrong in my life, had,“ he
added.

To help himslcf cope. Omallly
said, “l‘m ill a support group
(GMHC); in psycltotherap)’: l'm
taking vitamins until they come out
of lny cars: l'm trying to develop an
exercise routine, and l'm learning
nutrition."

When asked in a question~alld-
answer session why he concerned
himself with nutrition, tllc

that I can do to keep my health
generally good is going to help me. I
don't know that it (the nutrition
program) is going to help, but I'll
try just about anything to stay
well."

“There is no way you can get
AIDS by donating blood," Dr.
Caiazza responded to a question.
He said the “fresh, disposable
needles” used made that impossi-
ble. He added that the chances of
getting AIDS from receiving blood
are minimal and remote.

“Not everyone who has AIDS
has led a promiscuous lifestyle,"
Cltriston told the audience.

“Overall, there have been less
than a dozen cases of AIDS in
Albany," said Werner Kuhn. head
of tllc Capital District AIDS Task
Force. Kuhn also said the task force
anticipates selling up a hot lillc in
January, and is now recruiting hot
line volunteers.
