v _ Kings Mills. Ohio
.(AP) It's not that Augustana Col-
lege doesn't like the pass. The Divi-
sion III national .football cham-
pions just like to save It for the right
moment.
On Saturday. that moment came

with Augustana staring at a fourth«

and-goal at the Union College

> just 3:09 to play in the NCAA:
small-college championship game.

Penney. The senior took the snap.
rolled right and spotted tight end
Norm Singbush in the end zone for

UPS

his third touchdown pass of the
game. giving the small college from
Rock Island. lli.. its first national
football title with a 2l-l7 victory.
“Nobody said we couldn’t
throw." Reade said. “It's just that
we've chosen to do other things.”
Augustana came into the title

game at the Collegefootball Hall’
of Fame with an lI-O record'and a
pronounced preference for the run.
Using the Wing-T formation.
Augustana rolled up an average of
346 yards per game rushing. tops in
the country among small colleges.
AI Bagnoli. head coach of the
Union College team from Schenec-
tady. N.Y. had his defense key on
the Augustana running attack
Saturday. with good success.
Agustana was held to I94 yards

rushing on 53 trics.

“We thought we did the things
we had to do." Bagnoli said. “We
felt we had to stop their run; we did
that. I don't think they could ltave

“Unfortunately. they threw the

Union College. which brought a
l0-l mark to its first title game.
stttnned Augustana with IO quick
points on Greg Sticka's 30-yard

field goal and junior quarterback
Dan Stewarth 45-yard touchdown
pass to tight end Frank Kraft.
Penney tossed a IO-yard scorittg
pass to wide receiver Nick Kasap in
the second quarter. but Stewart
struck back with a 24-yard
touchdown pass to wide receiver
Rich Kcllahcr in tire third quarter
for a l7-7 lea‘d. At that point.
Augustana needed both luck and
Pcnney's passing. It got them.
Penney, who won two regular-
season games with touchdown
passes to Singbush in the last four .

minutes. lobbed a IO-yarder to the
tight end with 9:00 to play. Two
plays later. a fumble recovery gave
Augustana the ball on the Union
46-yard line. and Penney went to
work again. Penney completed
passes of 6 yards to running back
Craig Allison and l2 yards to
Singbush as Augustana marched to
the 2-yard line in lo plays. Reade
decided to pass rather than to have
freshman Joe Mackay try for a ty-
ing field goal under pressure.

“Pressure is not unusual to Pen-
ney." Reade said.

Penney rolled right. saw his
primary receiver covered. and then
hooked up with Singbush as the
tight end slanted across the end
zone for Augustana's first lead of
the game.

Union drove to the Attgustana
l7—yard line. but Stewart's fourth-
down pass fell incomplete with l:27
to play to end the threat.

“Wejust didn't make enough big
plays on either offcttse or defense."
Bagnoli said. “We've got to make
more big plays than what we
did." i l

Fans boo pro-game prayer

El Paso. TX
(CPS) — University of Texas-El
Paso football coach Bill Yung has
agreed to keep religious practices
off the playing field after he pro-
voked the wrath of a number of
spectators by holding a public team
prayer meeting before a recent
game against Baylor University.

“It was really a spontaneous
thing," says Bill Walker. UTEP‘s
communications director. "Grant
Teaff. the Baylor coach, and Yttng
are good friends, and decided to
hold a joint team prayer out on tltc
field before the game.“

But the incident subsequently
drew the ire of spectators and
observers who felt the religious ser-
vice was out of place at a state
school at an an event which has no
ostensible connection to religion
anyway.

“We did receive some com-
plaints. and some letters appeared
in the campus and local El Paso
papers. in all cases condemning the
prayer at the football game."

Walker says.

“Our coach has told us it was a
spontaneous. one-shot event, and
likened it to a locker room prayer
between the two teams."

The on-field prayer — in which
athletes from both teams huddled in
the middle of the field and recited
the Lord's Prayer — also drew cx-
tra attention “because it wasn’t
broadcast over the P.A. system,
and a lot of people didn’t know
what was going on." Walker adds.

“Bill Yung is a very religious
man." explains a spokeswoman in
UTEP's sports information depart-
ment. “One of his players wanted
to lead the team in prayer on the
field. It's not a customary gesture
on the field. but they may do it
(regularly) in the privacy of their
own locker room before the game."

Yung saw this as a special occa-
sion because he was once Tcaff’s
assistant at Baylor. notes Maxey
Parrish of Baylor's sports informa-
tion office.

ASP triumphs;
SA snowballed
in football game

The Student Association learn
represented by SA vice-president
Jeff Schneider forfeited to tire
undefeated ASP team in snow foot-
ball action Iast Sunday. A con-
tingent of ASP players joined with
the three SA representatives that
did show up to form the mixed
squad that won the ensuing game
with seven touchdowns to the
ASP's three.

The game was never in doubt as
the SA/ASP sqttad motored back
and forth across the field. Because
of the cold. snowy conditions.
many players found it difficult to
catch passes or even take the game
seriously.

Despite this. there was sotnc rcrtl
gridiron excitement on the field.
News Editor Steve Fox madc a
nttmbcr of impressive rcccptions
repeatedly going deep into ASP Icr-
ritory for big yardage and two big
touchdowns. Sports Editor Tom
Kucttndcs converted one short
scrccn pass into points on tltc board
early on with a 30-yard rotttp
through ASP defenders.

On tltc other side. ASP Editor irt

turnout. tltc gatnc was in all
respects successful. Said (icsncr.
“This just goes to show that the

After their best season ever last year. the
Albany State women's gymnastics team
knows they have a tough act to follow this
season. but after thoroughly outelassing a
less-experienced Hunter College team in their
debut Friday night.‘the expectations of this
year's team go far beyond last year’s suc-
cesses. , -

The Danes dominated every event in their
home opener and mounted an impressive
l-tl.l5 points to Hunter's far-less spectacular
“5.8. The key to the victory was the Danes'
strong balance in each competition which
was greatly due; to the commendable perfor-
mances of many new additions to this year's
squad. a facet which sixth-year coach Pat
Duval-Splllane hopes will continue
throughout the season.

“With the loss of Elaine Glynn (an NCAA
Regional qualifier last season). I was hoping
to get some new talent this year and it seems I
got a lot more than I asked for. The older
girls will be consistent and hopefully they will
help the younger ones develop that same con-
sistency."

Last year‘s team recorded a fine 9-2 record
and placed 8th in the NCAA Division II
regionals. an accomplishment which is all the
more remarkable being that Albany State's
team is in Division III. The team was led by
Glynn and senior Virginia Lockman. both of
whom qualified for the NCAA Regionais.
Lockman. a senior from Merrick. N.Y.. is
one of this year’s tri-captains. along with
senior Elicia Steinberg and junior Anne
Thamasctt. The captains displayed Friday
night why they were chosen to sct the exam-
ple by recording impressive performances irt
each of their events.

In the opening event. the vault, Lockman
tallied the high score with an 8.0. Karen
Thamttsctt. who was an all-around stand-
out. cxeeutcd a beautiful "front hand-spring
off the vault” and finisltcd a close second

with a 7.9.

The uneven parallel bars presented the op-
portunity for the older halfof the Tltamnsctt
Sisters. Anne. to display her prowess. Site
scored the high of 7.35 and showed the style
and strength of a true champion. Behind
Anne was sophomore Karen Bailey. from
Syracuse. N.Y.. who finished with a score of
7.25. Bailey. who was plagued last season
wrth an ankle injury, showed anything but
rusttness throughout the night‘s events by
also scoring high in the vault and on the
balance beam. besides winning the floor excr-
crse.

In the balance beam competition.
sophomore Brenda Artnstrong. who was
third in scoring last season for the Danes.
continued her winning way by achieving a
strong 7.85. Big things are expected this year
from Armstrong. who is from Aitamont.
N.Y. Other high scorers in tire event were
Bailey and junior Jennifer Cleary.

The floor exercise. the final event of the
evening. proved to be Bailey's real chance to
display ltcr creativity. In a fast-moving high-
spiritcd routine. Bailey showed her in-
dividuality and impressed the judge cnottgh
to scorc an event-high 7.95. Tri-captain
Steinbcrg also tttrtted in a very imprcssive ex-
ercise and finished sccond.

One of the other upperclassmctt who
Coaclt DuvaI-Spillanc expects it lot front is
Lynn Saravis. Sttravis. from Syossct. N.Y..
had a very fine performance in the floor excr-
cisc and should contribute in many of the
otltcr cvcnts.

Ailltouglt the frcslttttctt on the squad were
not heard from among lltc winners. they did
show a lot of promise of things to cotnc.
Terri Sokoi. who competed in the vault and
uneven parallel bars. and Nora Ilcllantoni.
who also cotttpctetl III the hats and floor excr-
cise, both showed that they will he hcard
from them very soon. Karen Davis. ftotn
