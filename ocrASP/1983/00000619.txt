Libby. Post reﬂeCtsOn time asmediadirector

 

By Anny Adams

srxn- RITER

For the past few months the came
an: has been made increasingly eon-
tcious of a number of women’s
Issues through events such as
Women's Safety Awareness Days,
and programs like a new escort ser-
vice. The woman helping publicize
it all, Libby Post, is leaving Student
Assoication (SA)
at the end 'of this 
semester. ,

Post has been 
awarded a Revson
Fellowship from Revlon entitled
“Women in Public Safety Policy
Fellowship." and she will be work-
ing as a staff member for the Task
Force on Women's Issues at the
State Legislature ‘under May
NeWberJter. Assamny member
Great Neck, NY.

Post is SA Media Director,
Vice President of the ASP Corpora-
tion Board, and a Teaching Assis-
tant for the Rhetoric and Com-
munications Department.

She has been involved in student
politics for seven years. She began
at SUNY Buffalo in 1976, where
she was involved with student
politics, and edited the Buffalo-
nirm, the school yearbook. At the
end of her sophomore year Post
went to the Student Association of
the State University (SASU) as a
Communications intern and three
months later was asked to be
SASU’s Communications Director.
She left SASU in August, 1979, and

went to work as a graphic artist.

In the Fall of 1980, Post returned
to school at SUNY Albany as a
part-time undergraduate student.

“it took me two years to ﬁnish
my last semester and a half." Post
said. "In the fall of l98| [started at
SA as a Comp. Director. So began
my long and prestigious career in
the Student Association."

She began the SA publication,
The Student Voice, in I982. In that
same year Mike Corso, then Presi-
dent of SA. and Ann Marie LaPor-
ta, then SA's Vice President, asked
Post to be SA's Media Director.’
Since that time she has acted both
as Media Director and political ad-
visor to SA presidents, Post said.

Richard Sehaffer, current SA
president, said, “Libby served as
one of my closest advisors on a lot
of issues we're dealing with this
year. i was new at it, and she was
able to answer a lot of questions
quickly about student politics and
how the outside world perceives stu-
dent government."

Corso described his experience
with Post as “excellent.” “She was
extremely helpful, even more than
in her role as Media Director. She is
very knowledgeable in political
aspects of the campus, such as
Women’s Safety and Women's
Rights, the SUNY budget —— a
whole gamut of experience,” Corso
said.

Post said she became interested in
women’s rights and feminist issues
during her tenure at SASU. She
considers one of her successes at the

Student Association to be the rais-
ing of the issue of Women's Safety.
She was one of the prime movers
behind the “Don't Walk Alone"
campaign and the Women’s Safety
Awareness Days.

Post said she is also proud of The
Student Voice. “it has become a
credible publication. It tackles
issues other campus publications
don't address, such as racial
stereotyping and student advocacy
issues.

Post could not recall failures, but
she has had disappointments. One
recent disappointment was revealed
in an issue of the Voice on the treat-
ment of gays and lesbians. Accor—
ding to Post, a large percentage of
reactions on campus to gays and
lesbians was negative. “I’m going
to give a lecture on the image of
women in advertising." she added.

Post said she was disturbed by
the amount of power students seem-
ed willing to allow her as a teacher.
"I had a bizarre feeling that
students saw me in a position of
authority. 1 was amazed at ltow
people just handed me power.
Students should be more careful
about that. They need to be aware
of how tnuclt they turn over to pro-
fessors," Post said.

She said she wished her students
had challenged her more, and that
they need to think more about their
relationship to their professors.
“They need to listen to each other
in order to team." she said.

Sehaffer expressed regret at

 

 

 

SA Media Director Libby Post

 

 

Noted as a strong advocate of women '5 rights.

Post's departure. “When anyone
leaves before a term is up it’s sad,
but especially Libby: she’s priceless.
She brought another perspective, a
strong advocacy of women's rights
that had been lacking in the
Association. If l’m to be responsi-

 

ble for representing all students, i
need to be surrounded by different
people who can bring in other
views. Libby is top notch, and she
helped me make better decisions.
We will miss her a great deal," he
said. El
