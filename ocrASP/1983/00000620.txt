question Are You Jewish After All?
That was the question addressed

Wednesday in a lecture by Rabbi -

Reuvan Firestone of the Reform
rabbinate. The seminar focused on
the question of matrilineal descent
in determining the heritage of a
Jewish child. and examined the re-
cent decision by a conference of
American Rabbis to overturn this
tradition.

"Traditional Judaism deals with
defining who is a Jew and who
isn't. The law states that the mother
determines whether or not the child
is a Jew." Firestone said.
"However. in the Reform move-
ment we were ﬁnding that there
were children who were raised as
Jews. only to be told at adolescence
that they were not Jews simply
because their mother was not
Jewish. even if their father was."
He explained that this was a serious
problem in the congregations.

Firestone illustrated' the Biblical
precedents in determining the status
of these children. He showed that
the earliest indications in the Bible
were that the descent was determin-
ed by the father, not by the mother
as is traditional in Judaism today.
“in terms of determining who was
important in the lines and continui-
ty. the sons were important. if there
were no sons. then the daughters
were married to their male ﬁrst
cousins in order to keep the in-
heritance in the family. it is clear
that Biblically, the descent was

determined by the father. until the
Book of Ezra," the Rabbi said.
The Book of Ezra was the ﬁrst

Biblical indication of a switch to

matrilineal descent. according to
Firestone. “in the Book of Ezra.

the“ descent becomes deﬁnitely

matrilineal." he noted. He added
that the status of the children from
this point on follows the status of
the mother. and , became
mainstream Jewish tradition.

.it is this Jewish tradition that was
challenged in March by a decision
of the Central 1 Conference of
American Rabbis. “The rabbinate
declared that the child of one
Jewish parent is under the presump.
tion of Jewish descent." said the
Rabbi. “This presumption is
veriﬁed through actions in the
Jewish faith. The child is then legal-
ly classiﬁed as a Jew.”

The decision created a great deal
of controversy both within
American Jewish sects and
throughout Judaism international~
ly. “There is the question of
whether or not one group of Jews
has the authority to change years of
Jewish tradition in this way,"
Firestone said. “There is a general
feeling in parts of the Jewish com-
munity that it is wrong for one
quick decision to overturn Jewish
tradition in this fashion. They feel
that this decision would destroy
years of Jewish unity."

Rabbi Firestone then went on to
discuss the rationale behind the
decision. He focused on three
primary factors — that the tradition
of descent in Judaism has not been
consistently matrilineal. that the
tradition of descent moved from a
patrilineal to a matrilineal tradition
due to the Biblical circumstances
which are illustrated in the Book of

Ezra, and that in present times in-
termarriage has forced Judaism to
look for another solution.

“it was the determination of the
Reform rabbinate that intermar-
riage is a problem, and one that is
not necessarily going to go away.
This raised the question of whether
it is fair to penalize those children
who have been raised as Jews mere-
ly because their mother was not
Jewish. it is not fair that these
children are forced to suffer the
identity crisis of wondering whether

they are Jewish or not,” Rabbi
Firestone said.

The Rabbi's statements were
echoed by JSC-Hillel President
Ellen Dickter. “A few years ago.
there wasra question raised as to
whether I was Jewish or not since
my grandmother had converted to
Judaism. This was a very traumatic
experience for me, since Judaism is
such albig part of my life. it was
very hard for me to imagine that i
could possibly be not considered
Jewish. Fortunately. after i in-

vestigated the matter, i found that
her conversion was authentic con-
version. But I can understand the
identity crisis that being raised a
Jew and then rejected by other
members of Judaism would cause."

Rabbi Firestone also indicated
that it was not positive that this
declsron will be accepted and
upheld by the Jewish community.
:‘The Jewrsh community will decide
In future generations whether this
de‘cdision will be upheld or not." he

Gain in college population seen

Washington, D. C.
(CPS) Despite a shrinking number
of l8-year-olds. the college popula-
tion may have increased this year to
12.7 million students, an increase of
Li percent, according to a new na-
tional survey. The enrollment in-
crease, though slight, comes al a
time when observers expected a
drop because there are fewer
l8-year-olds —- who traditionally
are the new college freshmen who
keep enrollments up —- in the
population at large.

But college enrollment went up
this year largely because of an in-
crease in the number of part-time
students. according to the study.
which polled over three thousand
campuses. it was performed by the
Association Council for Policy
Analysis and Research, a coalition
of Washington-based higher educa-
tion groups. Part-time student
enrollment went up 1.6 percent this
year, compared to full-time student
enrollment that stayed virtually
steady. the study found.

“More people are finding reasons

 

to go to college," explains Elaine
El-Khawas, vice-president for
research at the American Council
on Education and one of the
survey's overseers. The enrollment
increases "have something to do
with the economy," El-Khawas
speculates, adding that many peo—
ple opt to attend or stay in college
when jobs become scarce.

The number of first-time students
remained steady, the study found.
despite the diminishing population
of l8-yearvolds. in fall 1982 the
number of first-time freshmen
dropped 3.3 percent. This fall it
dipped only 0.3 percent. “The
number of l8-year‘olds is an in-
creasingly poor indicator of college
enrollment,” El-Khawas says.
There is “no fixed percentage of
teenagers going on to college."
Now only about half of high school
graduates proceed to higher
degrees, and more older people are

going or returning to school, she.

points out.
Private college enrollment re-
mained the same after last year’s

decline in the number of first-time
full-time students. But four-year
public schools continued to lose
ﬁrst-time freshmen. down 3.6 per-
cent from last year. the study
reports. El-Khawas feels, however,
that the difference “is not signifi-
cant enough to try to interpret."
She points out that some pttblic
schools have had to limit Clll'ilii-
ment because of budget problems
and state plans to contain university
size.

The increases, moreover, have
helped colleges take in ntorc tuition
revenues, adds M.J. Williams of thc
National Association of Collcgc
and University Business Officers.
Williams also attributes the increase
to the economy. “in times of rcccs-
sions. people start going back to
college and upgrading their skills."

if the current economic i’L‘Cm‘cl y
trend continues. Williams gttcsscs
people may turn again to the job
market instead of seeking cducu-
tion. He says to avoid a monetary
squeeze. colleges will have to do
some planning forthatrccovcry. . L

Kent, Ohio killing four and wounding nine.

(CPS) Thirteen years after four of
its students were killed at the climax
of the antiswar movement, and

.after llyears of almost ~unrellevedt
t confrontation between students and

administrators over how to
remember the tragedy, Kent State
University truStees finally voted last
week to work with students to con-
coct and build a campus memorial
to the dead students.

KSU‘s unwillingness to accede to

student and faculty requests to

build a memorial was arguably the
last vestige of the anti-war move-
ment of the sixties and early seven-
ties. "We aren't shouting at each
other any more." says Steven
Thulin. now a grad student at Kent
State. “The feelings of ill-will have
largely disappeared." adds Kenneth
Calkins. head of KSU's Faculty
Senate.

The trustees voted to join com-
munity groups and the May 4th
Task Force —- the student-faculty
group that has led the long struggle
to memorialize the tragedy — in a
committee to find an appropriate
physical memorial to the slain
students.

The students were killed on May
4th, 1970. Students nationwide had
declared a national strike to protest
President Richard Nixon's sudden
invasion of Cambodia, which
marked the ﬁrst widening of the
war in Vietnam. The reaction at
home was marred by occasional
violence. some of which occured in
the town of Kent. Ohio Gov. James
Rhodes called in the National
Guard to maintain order on the
campus. But on May 4th. Guard-
smen abruptly opened fire on a
peaceful campus demonstration.

The outrage and tension that ex-
ploded at Kent State long outlived
the anti-war movement and the war
itself. Ongoing lawsuits against the

:university and the National GuardI

and the university's often-bungled
efforts to downplay the tragedy's
signiﬁcance in subsequent years
often exacerbated the tensions.
Among the more notable con-

frontations over the last 13 years
was the university's I977 proposal
to build a gym annex in the area of
the shootings. The proposal led to
large protests and sit-ins to try to
stop construction workers from
starting. The gym was finished in
l978 despite the protests. Also in
1978. :1 Cleveland foundation corn-

missioncd world-renowned sculptor
George Segal to build a memorial
for the campus. But when Segal
presented the ﬁnished sculpture to
KSU administrators. they rejected
it. chal's sculpture depicts the
biblical story of Abraham and
Issac, showing an older man
holding a knife over a kneeling
youth. whose hands are tied.

“it was inappropriate to com-

sons nnd the wounding of nine with
a statue which appears to represent
an act of violence about to be com-
mitted," then-KSU President Brage
Golding explained at the time.
Princeton quickly askctl to lake the
sculpture, and placed it on its cnm«
pus in 1979.

Golding then proposed to build a
Roman arch as a memorial. but met
unanimous disapproval.
Critics noted the traditional military
connotations of the arch. while
others complained it looked‘llke a'

proposal. and no substantial
memorial proposals emerged for

climate on campus now. and there
is a general feeling that we need
some kind of public memorial,
some kind of physical thing." says
Dr. Jerry Lewis, a sociology pro-
fessor and advisorto the [May 4th
Task Force. ‘ihe‘ student-faculty
group that unsuccessfully has press-
ed the trustees for a memorial for
13 years.

“We’ve been through this
before." says'Thulin. who used to
be a task force member. “But for
the ﬁrst time. allvthe concerned
groups — students. faculty. ad-
ministrators. alumni — seem to be
on the same general wavelength."
“The state of KSU." concurs
Robert McCoy, an English pro-
fessor who was a KSU vice presi-
dent under the Golding administra-
tion, “is one that acknowledges the
events of what happened here."

Faculty President Calkins at-
tributes the change of heart “to the
time that has passed, a new ad-
ministration (Michael Schwartz suc-
ceeded Golding in I981). and new
people on the board of trustees who
don‘t feel as closely involved with
those events."

Lewis attributes it to the unveil-
ing of the Vietnam War Memorial
in Washington, DC. last year.
Once the nation has begun to put
the war in perspective. the logic
goes, it can put the domestic con-
vulsions over it in perspective.

The trustees' willingness to find
an appropriate memorial isn’t of-
ficial yet. Last week‘s meeting
technically was of a board commit-
tee. not the full board. The full
board. however. is expected to ap-
prove the proposal to build an ap-
propriate memorial at its next
tnceting in mid-December.
