Musical Notes

   

Elvis Celebrates Chanukah
Mike Shun‘s Mrs. J.

by David singer

 'Well, I-‘olks. the bIg story of 1983

was the kid from Indiana who’s been
thrilling us since he was 10. That’s
right, Michael Jackson. Mlke had a
huge success with his Thriller record this
year, but that made his life far from
carefree, as more and more women
continued to claim to be his mother.
The most publicized case was the one
involving Billie Jean Williams, who
claimed that Michael was her il-
legitimate son, fathered by MTV Video
Jockey J.J. Jackson. This prompted
Mike to write the hit single, “Billie
Jean (is not my mother)." For Mike,
the whole thing is mostly just a
nuisance. He told me, “Most of them
just want me to remember to send them
flowers on Mother’s Day” . . .

Another big seller this year was the
Kid Creole and the Peanuts LP. Kid
Creole’s been working with the legen-
dary keyboardist Schroeder for years,
but it wasn't until recently that he
discovered that Charlie Brown was a
great rapper . . .

Expect a new LP any day now from
The Clash, featuring their newest
member, ex-pop star Barry Manilow.
Joe Strummer of The Clash told me the
other day how it all came together.
“We were doing a gig in London, and
he comes backstage in leather boots 3
leather jacket and a mohawk. He said
he wanted to join up.” Always con-
troversial, The Clash preceeded to kick
out singer/guitarist Mick Jones to
make room for Manilow, who ’has
since changed his name to Rotten
Viscious. Strummer said of the move,
“Jones had forgotten the original pur-
pose of the band and has become too
success oriented, Rotten’s just the op-
posite" . . .

I hate to admit it but even I didn’t
believe Jeane Dixon when she made her
1983 predictions, just one year ago,
that this would be the year that Jim
Morrison would reappear. Well, as you
know, she was right, and the Doors
came through with a hot one, ap-
propriately recorded ‘LIVE.’ Mean-
while, Morrison is tied up in a heated
court battle with Peter Frampton,
claiming that Frampton had no right to
name his 1975 LP, Frampton Comes
Alive, saying that he thought of the ti-
tle years earlier while he was still dead

One of the year’s best LP’s was the
debut record from ex-Secretary of the
Interior James Watt entitled He Said
James...l Said Watt. Unfortunately,
as you are aware, the story had a sad
ending when Watt was sentenced to life
in prison after the assassination at-

(continued next syllable)

 

tempt on the President and his family.
Watt still insists that it had nothing to
do with the name of his band, “The
Dead Reagans" . . . After a big year in
1982, the Stray Cats’ new LP Rant 'n
Rave. With The Stray Cats was a flop,
due largely to the “Rack and Roll Cat
Boycott” organized by The Cats 01
America Association. I had CAA
President Morris T. Cat over for din-
ner recently and he told me, “These
rock and roll cat groups have a lot of
nerve. The Stray Cats, the Polecats,
the Bopcats, the Rockats and the
Wankats are giving us real eats a bad
name." I asked Morris if he thought
the boycott would be successful and he
answered, “Those of us on the CAA
executive board; Sylvester, Felix, Top
Cat, Tom, Courageous Cat, Garfield
and myself, are more famous and get a
lot more respect that any of these rock
and roll cat groups. The American
public will listen to us. They’ll see."

I always figured that Bob Dylan
would get back to his roots and
reconvert to Judaism, but I was sur»
prised as anyone when Elvis Costello
made the big switch. Elvis told me last
week, “0y Vey, is that how you say it?
I’ve always wanted to record an album
of Jewish songs, and this is my big
chance." Elvis said in an INQUIRER
exclusive, “everyone's always recor-
ding Christmas songs, look at Springs-
teen.” Elvis, who is pictured wearing a
yarmulke on his most recent album,
plans to release his first single in time
for Chanukkah, the classic, “Oh
Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel, I Made Ya’
Out of Clay." In response to Elvis‘
comments, Bruce Springsteen has f ilcd
for a name change, protesting that “no
one realizes it, but l’m Jewish, We
always been Jewish, and always will
be. Bagels, Bar Mitzvah, Passover,
matzah, how do ya' like that?," said
Springstein . . .

The Cabbage Patch Dolls have had
a significant influence on all of our
lives since they showed up this ycm.
Rock and roll fans were pleasantly sur~
prised by the debut record by The Cub-
bage Kids on Harvest Records, We've
Come to Make Shoppers Fight. Unfor»
tunately, their first US. tour got off to
a bad start, when the girls were in :1
near fatal plane crash that left them
hospitalized.

“We should be back on the mud
soon,” said lead singer Stuffed L'hh-
bage. “We’re probably gonna change
our name though, to The Colc Sill“
Kids . . ." >

Well friends, that's about it Int
1983, the year in music. 1 know I've cu»
joycd it, and I hope you did too. llup—
py Holidays.

Did Morris the Cat have ties
with organized crime? That’s
the question San Franciscan
authorities have been asking
themselves during the three
years following the well-known
star's abrupt and unexplained
death. Morris, the nationally-
loved 9-Lives cat food
spokesperson, was replaced
abruptly in 1979 by an animated
version of Sylvester the Cat.
Outraged Morris fans were told
only that there had been an acci-
dent, and that the star was . . .
no more. ‘

INQUIRER reporters spoke‘

to the well-known Dr. Naguchi,
coroner to the stars. Dr. N.,
who was the basis for the show
Quincy, said with disgust,
“They wouldn’t let anyone near
the body. It was a closed coffin
ceremony, and I think only
three or four people ever saw
the body at all. The whole thing
was very suspicious."

Police have been speculating
that the feline was the victim of
a gangland-style execution.
“We had been watching Morris
carefully for several months
before his death,” a detective
told INQUIRER sources.
“We'd become convinced that
he was rather heavily involved
with importing cocaine into the
States from Peru. But was he
cool? With all the legal protec-
tion surrounding him, we’d
have been crazy to try to make a
bust."

So as police played a waiting
game, the feline star was involv-
ing himselfdeeper and deeper in
the drug trade. “At one point,
he controled about 75 percent
of the cocaine on the streets,"
one detective maintained.

in an exclusive interview, IN-
QUIRER reporters talked to
former Mafioso crimelord Marc
Latino about his connections
with the volatile Morris.”

“Morris and I went back a
long way together," the
crimelord asserted confidently.
“When he was younger, he was
a tough customer alright. He
was smart, and he kept his ass
covered.”

Fame changed this. “Being in
the public eye, it made him too
damned arrogant. Oh, i warned
ltim, but, being nationally
known, he figured he was safe
from the Dons."

That, Latino says, was Mor-
ris‘s big mistake. “He tried to
get cutesy with us, see, told us

he wasn't gonna put any of his
stuff on the streets for a while.
It was a carpetbagging dodge,
pure and simple; he wanted to

wanted to test the Dons.

But the Dons don’t put up
with stuff like that from no
pussy.”

The actual circumstances sur-
rounding Morris's death are
shrouded in mystery, but IN-
QUIRER reporters managed to
secure one version of the star's
demise from Latino:

“They tell ya it was old age.
They tell ya it was the ticker.
Bull! It was almost a week after
Morris’s big coke shutdown,
and he was sitting real pretty,
cheerfully disregarding
everything the Dons told him to
do. Naturally, they couldn't let
that go on . . . pride, y’know.
They broke into his basement
that Sunday — April 13 I think
it was —— and found him
frcebasing cocaine and catnip.
That kinda stuff‘s bad for you.
You know what i mean?"

Latino smiled. “It wasn‘t
easy. He fought like an
animal."

til Ii #
Was Morris killed by the
Mafia? Latino says yes, but
detectives are reluctant to ac-
cept this explanation.

“Oh, he was probably involv-
cd with them in some minor
way," a source allowed, “but
that’s pretty much routine when

you’re as heavily involved in the

The authorities favor the
theory that Morris merely over-
dosed on drugs and alcohol, one
more in a long line of burned-
out superstars.
(continued next column)

“He was really unhappy at

that time," an industry source
leaked, “because a motion pic-
ture deal with Columbia had
just fallen through and his con-
tract with 9-Lives ran at least
another 3 years.”

Suicide or murder? We can
never really be sure. The
shrouded story of Morris the
Cat is a puzzle even we at the
INQUIRER are unable _to
solve.

In Common?

Tells All

by John DeMasi

The Cabbage Patch Craze is
reaching epidemic proportions.
Not only are common people
susceptible to their cute little
computer-designed mugs, but
celebrities have also fallen prey
to the wecdy little orphans.

The INQUIRER has learned,
through an exclusive interview,
that actor-singer-wanker Scott
Baio is having a torrid romance
with a Cabbage Patch doll. Ac-

cording to Scott, “She's a
doll."

How did they meet? Scott
says, “1 was in my favorite

restaurant, Frank‘s Dining
Room, eating lunch when in
walked this gal, about 12 inches
tall, with buttons for eyes."

Was it her beauty that at-
tracted Scott to her? "No,"

says Scott, “not at first. The
first thing I noticed was that she
smelled like sauerkraut. I love
sauerkraut." Scott goes on to
tell how she played hard to get
at first. “Then I offered her
some of my corned beef and she
sat on my lap. Her name is
Eileen Dover."

Scott has revealed that he’s
even recording an album for his
new love. Some of the songs on
the new record are “Anarchy in
the Cabbage Patch," “Uptown
Doll,” “Green Wedding" and'
“Skunk Cabbage Love.”

Word has it that Scott was
having trouble relating to
women. Since he's met Eileen,
however, he‘s as happy as a
lark. ls marraige in Scott’s
future? “No, l'm going to
adopt her." According to Scott,

 

“Just thinking about her causes
