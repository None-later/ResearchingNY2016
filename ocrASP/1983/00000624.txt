Durschlag rilorously exploring his stomach ca

I
by Sttv Durschlag
The Modern Dilemma

The other day, I ran into a
friend i hadn't seen for several
months. He had lost something
in the neighborhood of fifty
pounds. Fifty poundsl Gosh, he
looked terrible. “How can you
treat yourself that way?" I
demanded. “Do you know what
you’re doing to your body?"
My flabbergasted friend
countered. “I’ve trimmed off
all that excess fat, developed an
above-average aerobic breath
pattern, and crammed myself
with everything from
asparagus, broccoli and
cauliﬂower to yams and zuc-
chini. I've never been
healthier."

This encounter set me think-
ing. People, it seems, have
become so obsessed with a par-
ticular image of healthy living
that they have taken it to an
unhealthy extreme. This pattern
isclearly revealed in what I call
the “bipolar analysis." On one
hand, these health fiends
deprive themselves of certain
foods and activitim which. in
moderation, are necessary and
beneﬁcial for the maintainence
of a truly healthy lifestyle. And
on the other hand, they overin-
dulge in those foods and ac-
tivities they have chosen as
necessary for their own version
of healthy living to such an ex-
cess that it ruins the potential
benefits of things which could
otherwise contribute to a
healthy way of life. Let us ex-
plore this bipolar view in a tad
more depth.

The asceticism of many of
these modern-day health
devotees is truly frightening.
Following the latest diet crazes,
they go months without sweets,
or fats, or protein, or car-
bohydrates. I know people who
would cut their tongues out

   

‘\

mitt
cheese to enter their systems. To
me, this seems like a perfect il-
lustration of the old “losing
sight of the forest among the
trees" metaphor. These fanatics
have forsaken any notion of
balance in order to pursue their
own one-sided visions. And
what, in reality. is the result of
their gastronomic tunnel-
vision? 1’“ tell you. Physical
and mental unbalance. Your
body is deprived suddenly of
substances which it, and all the
bodies preceeding it in human
history, have been accustomed
to. It expects these substances,
and maintains entire
physiological systems to deal
with them. And now these
systems — glands, organs, and
chemicals — are rendered ob~

     

   

lives. Of course, excessive con-
sumption of fatty substances is
no favor to one’s health. But to
deprive oneself completely and
absolutely of one of nature's
greatest gifts to man poses an
even greater danger to one’s
well-being. Fat hasn't survived
through the centuries for
nothing, you know. It makes
many important contributions
to the smooth and proper func-
tionin ot‘ the human'body. To

      

deny your fat is to deny your
health!

0n the other side of this
detrimental asceticism is an
equally detrimental indulgence.
The health mongers focus in on
particular foods or exercises,
and proclaim them to be the on-
ly ones worthy of attention.
Some of these ‘final solution’
combinations include: refried
beans, seltzer water, and jogg-
ing backwards; jerusalem ar-

 

 

nectar with swimming to work
in the morning and hanging
upside-down at night; and so
on. Regardless of the beneficial
nature of all of these things,
when they become the solitary
product of an obsessional

g rlifestyle they can only do more

harm than good. This leads to
an imbalance much in the same
way that the deprivation does.
The body is designed to handle
only a certain amount of any
particular consumption or exer-
cise activity. Anything that goes
beyond the body's capacity to
deal with it, no matter how
healthy it may have been, now

becomes abusive. This is sadly

the case with most ol' today‘s
diet crazes. They push one or
two varieties of food, and grind
you into the earth with their
own ‘cure-all’ exercise. Take for
instance the new Broccoli~And
Pogo-Stick Plan (with the cor-
responding Broccoli-and-Pogo-
Stick Center in Palm Springs).
Broccoli is one of the healthiest
foods on earth. But after a
point you begin to consume
more broccoli than your body is
able to handle, forcing it to per-
form unnatural and destructive

3acts in order to correct this im-

balanced diet. You burn
yourself out. The same occurs
with the pogo stick, the
beneficial effects of which are
known the world over. Yet too
much time on the stick, and you
force your body to compensate
in some unnatural manner.
After a month on this plan you

won't be m: to recognize
yourself; m- body will have
altered i f SD drastically to
adjust to this alien lifestyle
YOU’ve be” subjecting it to.
You'll s m a stranger to
yourself, a it you’ll be off the
next dayt pursue some new,
C(Wally unit danced and fleeting
plan.

The t . hing Answer

For tho: of you who seem
lost in this lethora of ﬂeeting.
‘cure-nll'd is, you can come

the Durcltl Plan (and plan 10

The entlr Durschlag Diet is
built aroun a return to the
undervalu ood value of the
fats I‘ood up. in the mad
modern ms to shed as much
poundage - quickly as possi-
ble, the b‘ goodness of a
high-lat die as been greatly
overlooked. - u makes for ex

most reliablsources of long-
term energy.  d it gives you a

   

  

 

substantiality which no
vegetables or whole grains can 1
match. And excess fat stores
easily in layers} and folds and
rolls throughout the body,
unlike many vitamins and
minerals, which, in order to be
digested, force your body into
overtime and unnatural (and
unhealthy) rhythms and
balances. Mayonnaise, lard,
butter, whole milk, cream
cheese. beef . .a return to these
foods is a return to the basic
goodness of a smooth, solid,
high-fat nutritional plan. Any
diet based around the un-
discovered wonders of the fats
food group is sure to restore
that sense of complete, healthy
living all these other come-and-
go plans have robbed you of.
Come home to fat.

 

Snacks. Vegies, Beer and Sugar
A mention should be made of ‘
several other overlooked food
groups which, when properly
used in the context of a healthy,
high-fat diet, can enhance the
beneficial potential of the Plan.
The Snacks Food Group:
There are many nutritional
possibilities in this food group.
Potatoes —— in their chip form
— are a great source of vitamin
C, something not to be forgot-
ten, with winter just around the
corner. in fact, most of your
nutrient needs can be satisfied
within the snacks group.
There’s corn, for instance, in its
many munchable forms. And
onions, of course, in the old

 

sense of i rmanence and

solete. The complex, inter-
related, network of biological
processes which keeps us going
is disrupted. The organic func-
tioning of the body collapses in-
to an incomplete and unbalanc-
ed state. This physiological
breakdown has a direct impact
upon the emotional makeup of
the dieters. They begin to feel a
sort of emptiness inside, which
drives them to explore alter-
native ways of living which will
restore the completeness and the
balance they have lost. What
these poor, misguided souls do
not realize is that the source of
their dissatisfaction is within
their own self-imposed depriva-
tions.

The main target of these so-
called health programs has been
fat. Fat has become
synonymous with Evil in
today's society. It is taboo to be
‘zaftig.’ A hearty or voluptuous
figure is a sin. The thought of
ingesting even a tiny drop of
mayonnaise would send many
of my acquaintances ﬂeeing in
terror. These people have em-
barked on a crusade to
eliminate the slightest traces of

fat from their bodies and their

,- The INQUIRER has learned
J. at David Singer, General
anager of SUNYA radio sta-
n WCDB and singer Elvis
stello have been rendez-
ustng in Dippikill.
“It’s not surprising,” said
e source, “since Elvis has
ays been fond of Albany and

song, ‘Less than Zero’."

.hen we got to Dippikill.
ts kept saying how he was
vrng these terrible
htmares. He said that he
uld be sitting in the middle of
room when a bunch of

Hassidic men would surround
him & call him their leader,"
confided Dave.

“One night we were hanging
out around the fire, when a
huge cloud of smoke filled the
area. it was then that He reveal-
cd himself unto us. After a few
minutes i realized that we were
looking at Bob Dylan," Dave
revealed.

“Dylan said, Elvis, you are
my son, and as such you are to
dress like me and pray like me.
Then he told us to sell lBM at
123,” said Dave.

“i told him that i don't
believe in god," said Elvis,
“just peace. And love. And
understanding. Dylan got mad
and told me to pray to a golden
calf."

“it was like Divine inspira-
tion,” said Dave. “Bob kept
telling Elvis that the in thing
was to be Jewish. i guess he's
right, i mean he switched back
and Boy George wears a hasidic
black hat and has all of those

curls that look like Pat's. Also, I
heard that Mr. T wears a Chai
(Jewish good—luck charm) and
that Scott Baio was thinking of
having himself Bar
Mitzvahed."

“Bob’s image rc-appcared
during other visits to
Dippikill," remembered Elvis.
“One night he said, ‘Elv baby,
what's a sweetheart like you do-
ing in a place like this?‘ He
wanted me to come see the light
with him."

Shortly thereafter, Elvis
wrote “Everydav I Write the
Book." The song captures
Elvis' growing realization of his
strong prophetic base in the
Jewish religion. The accompa-
nying video displays Elvis in the

‘role of Moses. At one point

Elvis breaks the two tablets in-
scribed with the ten command-
ments.

thing is, l can’t stand the
thought of being circumsized. It
would sure make it a lot harder

peppers and other essential
vegetable products found in
most of the better dip products
on the market. Dipping is ex-
cmplary on the Durschlag Plan,
for it combines the best of the
. two most basic food groups —
‘fats and snacks. And if you
need to indulge in a whole
vegetable product once in a
while, this is certainly per-
missable, in moderation, on the
Plan. Just make a trip down to
the lower East Side of New
York City, and pick up a few
gallons of sour pickles, fresh of f
the street.

Deadly Tofu

AAAAAAAAAAA

 

YVVVVVVVY‘V‘V

I Researchers at Albany School of
'Psychedelia in Albany, New York
have discovered that tofu can be
fatal. According to Professor
Harold Nicholson Drool of A.S.P.,
a toxin found in spoiled tofu has
been ascertained to cause genetic
mutations in cockroaches. Many
,times these abnormalities are dead-
‘ly. It can cause blindness, gout,
brain tumors, syphilis and ultimate-
1ly uppitincss. According to Pro-
vfessor Drool, “We strongly advise,
ibased on our intensive studies, that
;pcople should avoid eating spoiled
tofu. There is no cure for this con-
dition, known as ‘Drool's Syn-

drome'. The only safe way to avoid 

 

about two other food groups
which can really be helpful in
making up for the lost time of
all the other unbalanced diets
you’ve been sucked into. The
Beer Food Group: a great
source of fast-energy car-
bohydrates, for you atheletes.
Beer doesn’t have any of the
acidity of natural fruit juices,
and it certainly gives your body
a lot more to work 'with than
any pure mountain spring water
will. The Sugar Food Group:
probably the most effective
source for a quick high energy
lift. And stuff with sugar tastes
really good! Just don’t forget to
brush your teeth.

Exercise

Exercise is certainly an essen-
tial component to any plan for
healthy living. in the Durschlag
Plan, exercise is specially plann-
ed to counter the harmful ef-
fects of all those other grueling
rigors you have been putting
your body through. One of the
most therapuctic activities,
discovered through decades of
research and testing, is hanging
out in a large reclining chair ——
the kind where the foot rest
comes up and the back goes all
the way back. A good recliner
will work on those abused
muscles and bones, relaxing
your entire body and allowing it
to return to its natural level of
functioning.

Another, more challenging
exercise is the bicycle rollers.
This contraption scts your bicy-
cle perched precariously upon
three frccspinning cylinders.
Find a location where you can
balance yourself with both
hands while sitting high up on
the rollers, then practice sitting.
See how long you can balance
yourself for. When you’ve
become really good at this, try it
with one hand (just make sure
you’ve eaten a good amount
fatty foods, to provide you with
enough padding to survive a
possible fall). This frees one
hand to continue eating while
you exercise, combining the best
of both worlds as you travel on
the Durschlag road back to
goodl health!
