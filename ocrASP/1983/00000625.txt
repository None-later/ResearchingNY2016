More than 100,000 special
children in America have never
felt the warmth and security of
a family's love. Their families
gave them up for adoption, but
they haven't been adopted. And
it’s all because they’re children
with mental, physical or emo-
tional problems and all have
one trait in common: they are
still waiting for a family to call
their very own. Here is yet
another touching story of a
child who needs a family full of
love.

Tony's a handsome, bright-
eycd boy with a beautiful smile
.and a size 46 chest — and he'd
beam with happiness if he only
had a family of his own to love
him! -

“l.want a nice family. A dad
to spar with and a mom who
likes to sit and quaf f a few fros-

(contlnued next paragraph]

ty ones every now and then”
said the charming 200 pound
IO-year-old.

But both family and quiet
drafts with mom, are just
dreams for Tony, whose life has
been one disappointment after
another.

When Tony was 6, he was
placed in a faster home because
his parents were driven into
poverty trying to provide for
him. -

“He grew out of his clothes
faster than we ‘could buy
them," said his mother. "Only
kid I've ever seen wearing
Garanimals with a full beard.”

“He did very well in that first
foster home," said Eunice, his
adoption caseworker. “He
learned to help out around the
place——— resurfacing the
driveway, and building a new
sunroom for the children to
play in. He used to love playing
“King Kong." He’d climb up

on the roof of the home, and
throw attendants, police, and
firemen around like ragdolls.

But then came another blow.
His foster parents were forced
to give him up, unable to cope
with the big bouncing
youngster. "The kid loved
animals. especially puppies,"
claimed Mr. Breen, Tony’s
former fOster father. “Loved to
hold them and pat them. Kept
sending them into comas.

“Also, we couldn't afford to
get involved in the cattle ran-
ching and farming essential to
keeping Tony fed."

"Tony is polite, affectionate,
and sometimes obedient,” said
Eunice. “He enjoys lacrosse,
rugby, and kickboxing. All he
wants is a compassionate, lov-
ing family that can give him the
full Universal gym he needs."

If you would like to adopt
Tony, please write to: 602 State
St., Flagstaff, Arizona 00690.

Elvis: Dead On Arrival?

Or Snatched Up By Bizarre Diet-Crazed Mutants?

By Robert Schneider

South Dakota farmer Fred
Frifl has come across what may
prove to be the answer to eter-
nal life — a secret diet known
only to aliens and Elvis. He's
also found proof-positive that
the King lives on!

On the night of September
12th, Mr. Friff was out in the
pasture of his 4,000 acre farm
and UFO research center in
Bellafonte, when a blinding
light appeared out of the sky. “I
was rearranging manure with a
hoe when I heard it. I may be
crazy, but it sounded like there
was music coming out of it! It
came down not 20 feet away. I

was so scared — I dove for
cover.” The ship looked amaz-
ingly like E.T.’s ship,

something that many other In-
quirer readers have observed in
their own close encounters.

Mr. Friff suspected the worst
from the aliens, however — "I
know that there are good aliens
and bad aliens. I really thought
that these could be body-
snatchers or something. I love
America, and would die to pro-
tect her. So I chased them
around with my hoe. They
couldn't run too well, on ac-
count of them having only one
leg. I was just about to bust one
of their heads open when the
leader turns to me and shouted:
'Don't hurt us, Mr. Friff . ..
we're friends of Elvis!!”’

This was quite a coincidence,
since Mr. Friff is chairman of
the South Dakota ‘Elvis is a
Saint' society. “When I heard
His name mentioned, l just
burst out in tears. i mean, Elvis
is The King. He made so many
people happy with his music,
not to mention his money. I met
Him once in Vegas.He'didn’t
say to much  I think he

NATIONAL

didn't feel too well. But I told!
Him that I thought He was
great. He looked at me, and
burped. But there was
something in the way that He,'
did it'that made me know that’
He was still The King. Andil
these guys were friends of His.
Well, a friend of Elvis is a
friend of mine."

Mr. Friff put down his hoe,
and put out his hand. “I invited
them in for some Kool-Aid and
popcorn. it was the darndest

thing — they spoke good
English. I still can’t figure out
how they knew my name. I
never saw anybody drink Kool-
Aid with their eyes, but these
were aliens. They were so
friendly, I figured it was my
American duty to ask them
about Elvis. They told me the
most amazing thing."

It seems that these aliens were
extremely fond of Elvis.

“They have really bad singers
on their planet, so Elvis was in

  

 

high demand. They’ve also car-
ried off Bing Crosby and
William Fawley!” Friff
reported that the aliens had
replaced these earth celebs with
robots.

“But when it came time to
lreplace Elvis, the robot just
wouldn't sweat! Naturally, it

away. so they just short-
circuited it and left it there."
Could this tragedy be the real
reason behind the supposed
“death” of Elvis? The body

, was never seen, after all. Mr.

Friff thinks that the aliens have
taken other celebrities, and may

, be after even more: “They were

very calm and nice, until they
saw my People magazine. They
started chirping and whistling
when they saw the picture of
.Victoria Principal at Dolly Par-
ton’s house. I asked them what
they were so excited about, but
they wouldn't tell me. If I were
‘any celebrity, I‘d be real real
scared right now. I think they
may be after Prince Charles and
Lady Diana." The Inquirer has
long stated the undeniable fact
that many human celebrities are
possibly aliens or robots, just
waiting to take over Earth.

Mr. Frifl' was, naturally, ex-
tremely concerned with the
health of The King. It was then

 

 

that he learned about the
miracle diet that may be the key

would've been found out right ‘

    
  

to eternal life: “They told me
that Elvis was down to 210
pounds, and was continuing to
lose weight. They were feeding
him a new diet, which supplied
all his needs, but kept him trim.
and the amazing thing is, it's
been in front of us all this time.
You see, you eat 2 pounds of
chocolate pudding per day,
washing it down with exactly 5
pints of Tree-sweet apple juice.
That’s all the King needs, and if
it’s good enough for Him, it’s
good enough for us!"

Dr. Rolf Wayne, the lit-
quirer's own medical adviser,
and Dean of the prestigious
Staten Island College of
Paraphysics, confirmed the
value of such a diet: “it’s a well
known fact that chewing food
causes heart stress, so a soft
food like chocolate pudding can
add years to the lifespan. The
apple juice does wonders for the
brain, where many of the in-
telligence cells are.”

The brief alien visit ended
after the aliens had taken Mr.
Friff's entire People and Us
magazine collection. “I really
think that we’ll be surrounded
by robots before long" remark-
ed Mr. Friff. “But I don’t think
that they'll try to hurt us. Why
would they give us the secret to
eternal life, and then slaughter
'us? It just don’t make any
sense.”

The-Playboy Prince Romps L
Thru ’83

With Reckless Abandon

 

by Jonas Nachsln

Although 1902 surer belong-
I to England's Prince Charles
l‘ltl his happy-go-lucky
eelheari Lady DI, Prince An-
rew. Charles’ brother, surely
tole the world's attention In
983. We tracked him down
ason by season.
inter: Everyone’s favorite
rat was tracked down by [N-
UIRER hounds on the sound-
tage of the present smash hit,
‘Falklands Cowboy.”
lthough Charles snapped up
he title role, Andy, always the
‘3 reat sport, told Charles, “I
.-, idn't get the part, ’bro, but at
 cast my nose doesn’t look like a
 lecdin’ pair of smokestacksl
‘ In an INQUIRER exclusive,
 rincc Philip, Andy’s father
cvealed that he sometimes likes
" o touch his son's forearm
‘ ccause, “Lizzy just doesn’t get
nto that kind of thing
nymore.” The proud father
dded jokingly, “I didn't raise
y Andy to let himself be
ouched by just anyone, you
know!
H spring: This time of year saw
A he Prince dating Koo Stark, a
if: ell-known porn star. Andrew
adly divulged that “me old
irlfriend was puttin' on the
ounds almost as fast as
lizabeth Taylor. Can we talk
ere?" Andy later had his heart
j roken when Koo decided to
V. it off with Andrew’s school-
me chum, John Holmes.
Andy made a fatal blunder
’ hen he was caught by a
olographer making a drug
V al with former big-time
llplayer, Bob Uckcr. When
‘ restioncd by police as to why
was selling cocaine-laccd
gar cubes to the Society for
uclcar Devastation and
cslruction, Andy firme
clarcd, “Anyone who doesn't
.n a train set is a fag.” The
tncc was later released on the
unds that the photographer

Summer: The prince was charg-
ed for the murder of Debbie
Boone. According to observers,
the prince entered an apartment
on Wardour Street, stripped to
his skivies, and subsequently
changed into an outfit once
worn by Eleanor Roosevelt.
When asked why he then clubb-
ed Miss Boone, Andy explain-
ed, “l was merely giving her a
noogie.” The Prince was again
released, on the grounds that he
didn’t realize the weapon in
question was actually a cattle
prod.

After narrowly escaping the
’ arms of the law the past two

months, the depressed prince in-
sisted on locking himself in the
supply room of an Akron, Ohio
Dairy Queen for the entire
month.

The Prince came out of
hiding, only to begin drinking
heavily. The effects on himself
and the Royal Family arc
devastating. The prince is
shown here before an imminent
gushing of his stomach juices
into an unsuspecting bucket.

 

The prince remarked later about
his problem, “If someone will
put that bucket drink on ice, l'll
bleedin’ slam it down!"

Fall: The prince was back in
fine form as he pulled himself
out of his unfortunate drinking
depression. During a speech
before the Brighton Garden
Club, Andy displayed a keen
sense of humor after making the
obvious blunder of propelling a
ball of phlegm upon one of the
members' checks.

The Prince began a nation-
wide campaign, travelling
across thc countryside in an at-
tempt to improve his govern-
ment’s relationship with the
cornmonfolk. In a rare episode,
Andy elicited an explosion of
laughter from the crow when he
candidly observed, “You peo-
ple arc the lowliest form of liv-
ing tissue on this earth and -—
no, no! —~ I’m just kidding!
Anyone care for a
pop-tart?!—Ha!"

More shenanigans from our
crazy madcap. After assuming a
command post in nearby

 

 

The Prince shown immediately before he presents the pail with an
unwelcome guest.

 

Devon, the prince quickly
established as unparalleled level
of discipline among his troop.
After one of his men disobeyed
a direct order to roll some play-
doh in the shape of an eight-
inch pickle, Andrew sternly
forced the troublemaker to
place his hand on Andrew's
temple and recite repeatedly,
“My mother is a loud-mouthed
putz and my father stinks of
clderberry.” Always the mer-
ciful, Andrew promised he’d

 

forgive the officer on the condi-

 

tion of the man’s completion of
viewing Leave it to Beaver for
eight consecutive weeks. Com-
menting on his heart-warming
leniency, the prince grinned and
said, “Aw, the kid‘s just a
goof.”

Well, I983 did prove to be a
big year for the “Playboy
Prince" and we'll just have to
see if he can top his crazy stunts
in I984. Ta!
