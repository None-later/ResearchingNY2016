0 the Editor: .

As an avid rock-n-roll fan and an individual who is well
formed of presunt articles dealing with the mtrsic in-
ustry. l was highly disappointed with your censorious arti-
lc discussing Billy idol and his latest album. Rebel
ell.Mr. Nachsin‘s sarcasm dOes not make up for his lack
fjustification for his carping comments. To state that
01's lyrics f‘eouldn’t be worse" or that they "are pretty
upid" without explaining why is simply poor journalism.
ebel Yell.currently in its second week in Bill Board's Top
H has received highly favorable criticism from the
ation's top music critics. The November isstrc of Rockbill
lagazine called the album "a cold disc well within reach."
im Sommer of the Village Voice praises Rebel
ell. because it combines “the rhythm of heavy metal with
e fleetncss of dance music." 1 agree with the record buy-
g public and qualiﬁed professional music critics who feel
at the album and its lyrics are meaningful and, it looked
beyond their immediate surface level. are poignant and
ought provoking. if one finds that ldol‘s lyrics “just
n't seem to make much scnsc."(as Nachsin states) then
aybc he or she is not trying to understand or interpret
em. 1 question the overly critical content of the article
d the printing of such a derogatory item less than one
cck before Billy idol‘s concert. Hopefully. readers of the

tiele will find it no more than an idle review.

o the Editor:

As Timothy Taylor‘s letter ill this 'l‘nesdtty‘s .AISP cx-
ibilcd considerable confusion about socialism and its
earning. 1 would like to take this opportunity to clear up n
'w points.

The central idea of socialism. us it developed over the
list few centuries. was that the economy should not be
mtrolled by the wealthy (Le. a few capitalists). but by the
nlirc society.

The problem for socialists was not the idert. but how to
nplcmcnl it. After the liolshcvik revolution in Russia,
mic socialists claimed that Lenin had shown them the
‘try: create it “vanguard” pnrty, surge rm armed uprising.
til the party leaders in power, and crush nil opposition.

uch people called themselves Communists. ()thcrs,

owcver. rejected this model as undemocratic and. in thc
)ug run. bound to fail. They favored creating Illtlss-httscti
olitienl parties. securing power through democratic clcc-
ions. gradually placing the economy under public owner-
hip or control, and maintaining fttll individual illld
oliticnl liberties. They called themselves Socialists.
Although Americans know u good deal about Com-
ttnist misrulc. they know fairly little about Socialist suc-
css. Throughout the world. voters have repeatedly elected
ocialisl parties to power. The French Socialist Party. the
wcdish Social Democratic Party. the Australian Labor
arty. the Finnish Social Dcmoeratic Party. the Spanish
ocialist Workers Party. the Irish Labor Party. the Italian
ocialist Party. the Portuguese Socialist Party. the
ustrian Socialist Party. and tnany others today govern
heir nations. either alone or in coalitions. Other Socialist

parties provide their nation's major electoral opposition:
the British Labor Party. the German Social Democratic
Party, the lsracli Labor Party. the Japanese Socialist Party.
the Jamaican People's National Party. to name only a few.

The reason for Socialist popularity in most democratic
nations is that the Socialists have made good on their pro-
mises. They have delivered steadily-advancing public
ownership and control of the economy. combined with full
political democracy. to their citizens. Free medical and
child care programs. public guarantees of jobs or retrain-
ing. ptrblically-owncd transportation and communications
systems. worker—run factories and industries —— these are
the fruits of democratic/socialist governtnents. They have
helped to transform their societies into sortie of the happiest
and freest in the world. with indiees of social well-being
that surpass those of the United States and the Soviet
Union.

Perhaps. then. it's time we stopped automatically
dismissing "socialism" and started to appreciate the work
of democratic socialist parties. Admittedly. capitalists and
commissurs in various nations have shown some governing
ability. and their rule has not always been a total disaster.
But it is clear that we can do better. Much better!

Tenure system

To the Editor:

Within the past two weeks the attention of your readers
has been drawn to the condition and future of our
undergraduate program. I believe that important issues
should be discussed and acted upon in a factual. objective
atmosphere. People may have deep feelings about matters.
bttt progress is thwarted when strong statements are made
without adequate justification.

Professor Myron Taylor apparently was interviewed con-
cerning otrr tcntrrc system. Let me quickly agree with Pro-
fessor Tnyior that we can strengthen otrr undergraduate
program. A number of weaknesses have been identified by
tr number of faculty. students. tmd administrators. and
changes are being made. Over the next 12-18 months i
believe that tlltisi of trs will see changes that we cart agree
strengthen the nndcrgrtuluutc program.

But runny statements made by Professor Taylor are simp-
ly not true. rmd they must be corrcctcd. 1 will bricily corn-
mcnt on sortie of the errors. The ASP featured a statement
about a “hurried [catching assistant" leading a lecture class
of 400 students. The fuel is thru only four sections of more
than one thousand that no iliL‘ offering this semester have
over 400 students in them. all taught by regular faculty.
stilllt.‘ of them top tcxettlcllcrs. No graduate student here
[catches n section of over 100 students, to say nothing of 400
students. in fuel. of over 225 graduate students who were
teaching ill Fall 1982. the latest comprehensive data
available, only 33 had more than 50 students. meaning that
85 percent bud small or moderate-sire sections.

Fuel: ()ur graduates have an impressively high rate of ne-
ceptancc into professional schools. not a low rrtte as im-
plied by Professor 'l'uylor. Here are the acceptance rules for
students applying to various professional schools: law.
97 (5’0; osteoputlty. 100%; dentul, 94%; optometry. 100%:
podiatry. 100%: rmd medical school. 63%, compared to
48% us the national average.

Fuel: Maury of our top research scientists re 'rtlrrrly teach
undergraduate courses. rm example being that both of the
1983 Excellence in Graduate Teaching Faculty are teaching
undergraduate courses. one at the lOO-lcvcl. Some of the
university's best researchers are routinely teaching
undergraduates. including freshmen.

it is nice to have pride in SUNYA. but it is somewhat
unrealistic to think that we could be honored by member-

ship on the US News and World Report list at this stage of
our development. We are. after all, only 20 years old as a
liberal arts university. while most other institutions on the
list are well over a century old and some are much Older.

We are not a liberal arts college. so if we choose to chan-
ncl all of our resources into the undergraduate program we '
would only make the list of poor universities. We must
strengthen every possible program. constrained only by our
imaginations, willingness to work hard.- and financial
resources.

1 extend an invitation to all who wish to improve the
undergraduate program to contact me with your ideas and
willingness to work. i promise we can and will improve the
undergraduate liberal arts program at this university.

Love not hate

To the Editor:

I'd like to take this opportunity to respond to Bruce
Levy‘s letter concerning 1. child sexual abuse. and 2. my
work as a feminist.

Firstly. 1 congratulate Mr. Levy on the valuable work he
does with young boys as well as being able to work for a
woman supervisor. The type of special education work he
does is important and I hope he is effective in dealing with
the young people who are his clients.

What 1 take exception to. however. is his allegation that
there are more boys who are victims of sexual abuse than
girls and that the perpetrators are mostly women.

in a recent conversation 1 had with Carla DiGirolomo.
Executive Director of the New York State Commission on
Domestic Violence. she cited a number of studies in which
there was conclusive evidence that girls, not boys. are by
and large. the victims and men. not women, are the
perpetrators. Tire following is a brief synopsis:

1. 1n rt study done by David Finkclhor. Assistant Direc-
tor of the Fumin Violence Research Program at the Univer-
sity of New Hampshire (1979). be surveyed 796 college
students in a random sampling. He found that 520 women
were victims of sexual abuse as children compared to 266
men — which meuns. according to Finkclhor. for every boy
who is rtbuscd. there are two girls. Finkelhor also found
Ilun for the 266 men. a majority of the abusers were also
men.

2. in 1975. of the 5058 reported sex crimes irt New York
City. 1375 of the victims were under 14 - 1012 were girls
and 324 were boys. '

3. in at study by Dianna Russell. a noted feminist resear-
cher. of the 930 women she asked. 43 had bectt abused by a
father and only one was abused by a mother. in surveying
other family members the breakdown was: 20 abused by
brothers. 3 abused by sisters; 46 abused by uncles anti none
abused by aunts: seven tlbuscd by grandfathers. and again.
none abused by grandmothers. These figures are consistent
when looking all other family members such as first cousins.
in—luws. clc.

Russell. when looking at some national studies found
that betwccn one-fifth to one-third of all women asked
reported that they had some kind of unwanted sexual en-
counter with nn adult male as :1 child.

4. In a national projection based on the Finkclhor study
(1979) and Kinsey‘s Sexual Behavior of the Hurmrn Hana/e
(1954 — in which he found that of the 4000 women asked.
25 percent had had sexual contact with adults as children).
it is estimated that within the next 10 years. 25 million girls
will experience unwanted sexual contact with an adult
before the age of 13 compared to 3 million boys — a dif-
ference of over 800 percent.

Perhaps Mr. Levy has come into contact with a lot of
young abused boys because of the types of programs he has
worked in. But. as the figures bear out, the majority of vic-
tims are girls. if he. or anyone else. would like to know
more about this. a series of legislative hearings on Child
Sexual Abuse are being held throughout the state. The one
in Albany is scheduled for February 14(Valentine's Day) in
the Assembly Parlor at the State Capitol Building.

Now. as far as my work as a feminist is concerned. 1 am
perplexed that Mr. Levy feels 1 should work with men
more. in my two and one half years with Student Associa-
tion, 1 have served under three male presidents. three mule
controllers. two male vice presidents and one fetnalc viu
president. Also. as we'all know. Central Council and mum
of the group leaders are predominantly male simply
because positions of leadership open more easily to men
than to women. Also. while 1 was Communications Direc~
tor til SASU. in 1978. l was the only woman on :t si\
member staff.

Perhaps Mr. Levy and others are perplexed by my lthilil)
to work within these organizations and maintain my
feminist politic and ethic. it is just a matter of commit-
rncnl. pchCVcranec and love (not hatred). 1 can not drive
myself by hatred. People should recognize and say that 1
love women instead of maintaining that 1 hate men.

My next step is into the legislature. Although l'll be
working on women's issues. 1‘" be working with men.
Perhaps what Mr. Levy and others get upset about is that 1
rarer let anyone get away with sexist or racist remarks and
that 1 am a constant thorn. Some find that pain to be
educational; some find it a nuisance.

-— Libby Post
