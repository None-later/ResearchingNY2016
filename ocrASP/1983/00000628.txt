Plans for bringing Democratic

presidential candidate Alan

Cranston to speak at the university

were also addressed. "We have just

about committed him toycome and

speak on campus." Salirln~ said. She,‘
expects Cranston to lecture in early

February. but “definitely before

the April (3) primary."

Cranston, she said. supports the
idea of having students run on the
slate of delegates for the
Democratic convention to be held
this July in San Francisco. "Now

we're looking for students In-
terested in petitioning for this."

The College Democrats also hope
to invite Gary Hart and John Glenn
to speak at SUNYAI and to pro-
mote the formation of committees
in support of various Democratic
candidates if members express the
interest. .

O'Brien said the group would not
endorse any one candidate until the
party selected its choice at the con-
vention. Until then. the College
Democrats would function “more
as a facilitation. presenting dif-
ferent candidates." O'Brien said.

The new group will hold its
meetings each Thursday at 8:30 pm
in the campus center. Salkin said. CI

drink. they don't write the letters

because of the coupon. That is not

the issue here,” he said. ‘
Tony Sabatino. owner of the

Lamp Post, maintained that the.

coupons were a well meaning
thought. “I did not see it as buying
votes," he said. “It was merely a

thank-you gesture for students who I

opposed the 2i proposition," he
added.

Bob Boor. owner of the Long
Branch on North Lake street, felt
that the whole situation has been
misinterpreted. “Obviously a cer-
tain segment of the public has seen
these coupons as an inappropriate
action." he said. “There was no in~
tention on tavern owners or stu-
dent's part to do anything
unethical. It was our way to public-
ly voice our opposition to 2i law."
he asserted.

If the drinking age is changed
from 19 to 2i. Bob Hclbock, Cen-
tral Council Chair, fears that
"there will be a severe damage to
the economy here. More drugs will
be used if people can’t get into bars.
and it may lead to other things to
do. not all of which would be con-
structive," he maintained.

Schaffer commented that other
schools have initiated similar letter
writing drives “in order to arouse

students." Participating schools in-
cluded Oswego. Oneonta. Buffalo.
Plattsburgh, and Binghamton, ac-
cording to Schaffer. Stonybrooit
offered ten kegs to the dorm whose
students wrote the most letters. 'y,

Schaffer said he is pleased with
the involvment on the campus that
this controversy has created. “I
love to see involvement, and this is
a good tactic to do it with." said
Schaffer. “This is a good way to ac-
tively involve people. They must
get to know what the issue is," he
stressed.

In other Council business, a

resolution was passed objecting to ‘

the change in the drinking age, and
calling for efforts to decrease the in-
cidence of drunk driving. Also,
Council allocated funds for an in-
tramural sports neWsIetter. and two
representatives resigned.

The resolution passed
unanimously by Council reads. "Be
it resolved that: The Student
Association of the State University
at Albany strongly objects to any
proposed legislation to raise the
legal drinking age." The second
part of the resolution reads. "Be it
further resolved that: The Student
Association feels that the battle
against drunk drivers should be an

attempt to further educate drivers
and to provide stricter enforcement
of the drunk driving laws."

The resolution allocating funds

Programming Director Rich
Golubow criticized the ASP for not
giving enough coverage to AMIA.
He said that the ASP is "falling
short of informing students."

Letters of resignation from off-
campus representatives Mark
Goldberg and Linda Carson were
read at the meeting. Goldberg cited
“time” as his reason for resigning.
Carson said she left Council
because of "academic work."

SA Athletics Controller Mike
Brusco announced that SA will
have to lease vans for athletics in
the future. Formerly SA purchased
vans, with the commissary pro-
viding free maintenance, he said.
According to Brusco. because of
“recent budget cuts" the com-
missary can no longer maintain the
vans free of charge. By leasing. they
will get free maintenance. he said.

$1,000 for the Pierce Hall Day Care
Center was passed unanimously. El
