The Alcohol Policy Review Committee has
released its ﬁnal advisory report. but has fail-
ed to reach an agreement on the issue of
whether or not to allow beer balls or kegs in
residential suites. according to a memo which
was released with the report from the com-
mittee's chair Vice President for Student Af-
fairs Dr. Frank Pogue.
The committee‘s final report is the first
’ step in creating a coherent alcohol policy for
 I: the University. Pogue is now soliciting opi-
; . ntons from campus leaders and will form a
. proposed policy which must pass through the
Student Advisory Committee of the Universi-
ty Senate Advisory Committee of the Univer-
. sity Senate before it reaches President
; O'Leary's desk and the University\Council.

The committee needs
“adequate -

opportunity to focus

on that issue alone. ”

Pogue said.

Pogue has asked the members to meet one
last time to try to resolve the issue. "i want to
be able to say that i feel the committee was

given adequate opportunity to focus on that
Issue alone.” he said. The committee will
meet early Friday morning.

Except for the “bulk-container" issue,
Pogue said he was satisfied with the report
and that it went beyond the charge he
originally gave the committee.

in the memo to Pogue the committee's
chairperson, Neil Brown. describes the report
as “a draft policy statement for your review
and use."

The report states that the University
“adheres to and enforces all federal. state.
and local legislation governing alcohol" in its

introduction, and Brown pointed out that
much of the committee’s work was concern-
ed with laws governing alcohol consumption.

Pogue said he was pleased with the com-
prehensive deﬁnition of the campus, in-
cluding all quads. academic buildings, the
downtown campus. the campus center. and
the physical education complex arrived at by
the committee. and the attention given to

every aspect of the policy.
Student members of the committee said
they were proudest of the section of the

 

report dealing with lounge parties. The
report recommends that lounge parties be
allowed if a Special Functions Form has been
filed.

SA Vice President Jeff Schneider. also a
committee member. said that this represented

a major victory for students. He said that -

lounge parties were allowed now if the

Special Functions Form is filed. He said there

was still much confusion over the issue and

blamed Residential Life for the confusion.

"'You can have parties...unless there's a
problem with the way they're set tip." said
Student Association’s Director of Student
Programming Rich Golobuw and a commit-
tee member.

While the report approved of allowing
alcohol in suites “for the reasonable con-
sumption of the residents of that suite/room
and their invited guests," it did not reach a
consensus on the issue of "bulk containers,"
meaning kegs or beer balls.

The committee decided to list the
arguments for and against bttlk containers
since a decision could not be reached and
three pages of the tcrt page report were
devoted to that issue.

Schneider said the _committce was

i

   

UPS

deadlocked on the issue. with many hours be-
ing devoted to the question. Brown agreed
with Schneider. saying that an informal vote
at one meeting revealed a 7-7 tie.

Schneider said he viewed the issue as an in-
vasion of students privacy if bttlk containers
were to be banned. “That's a very big issue

to me because that’s intruding on me...are‘

they going to tell me i can‘t have a girl in my
room next?"

Golobuw expressed his concern over the
issue. as well. He said he did not believe that
bulk containers should be banned. and
pointed out that hard liquor would be just as

‘ intoxicating yet there was no question of

whether or not to regulate that.

Off-Campus Housing Director Karlcen
Karlson said she viewed any regulation bann-
ing bulk containers as wrong. “i maintain
that if they don't intrude on the rights of
others...what you do in your own room is
your own business unless you come to the at-
tention of staff." Karlson said students tnust
take responsibility for tltcir own behavior.
“No one else can teach you about sex. i don't
think we can teach anything by legislating.

'El Salvador

<Front Page

The rebels have been waging a civil war
against the US. backed government for the
last four years.

The family was traveling with many of
their belongings in a converted schoolbus
with Alabama license plates, Lagana said.

Lagana said travelers may hire a customs
officer to accompany them for a $20.00 fee
so they will not have to make complete in-
ventories at the border with Honduras.

He said Cancel‘s body will be sent back
to the United States. probably Thursday.

Lagana said that since last year the state
departmcttt has been warning Americans it
is dangerous to travel in El Salvador.
especially in eastern regions where guerrillas
have strongholds.

Laguna snid Cancel was riding with her
common-law husband. Curtis Hendersen
Lewenz, 35. and two children - Lila Reveti
Cancel Lewenz. the lli-month-old chilld of
Caitch and Lewenz. and Christopher Len
MacDonnl. Citncel's five-year~old cltild by
n l'ormcr marriage.

The ctttbnssy quoted witnesses interview-
ed by the consular officers as saying the
family and tire Salvadoran guard were
traveling along the rottd "when a yellow
Toyota \‘clticlc pulled up from behind and
the occupants signalled to the family to
stop.“

Laganu said. “The guard told Mr.
Lewcnl. ltc should stop but apparently he
decided to keep on going ttntil they arrived
at it spot where two men ’ both armed
were standing by the side of the road.

‘-‘liy then the traffic was slowed down
and some vehicles were pulling off to one
side of the road. But Lewenz kept on going
and sped up. The guard did not speak
English and I do not KnOW'if Lewenz
understood Spanish well.

“But that is when...scveral shots were
fired from the surrounding hills. one of
them hitting Cancel on the right side."
Lagano said.

Lngana said Cancel died soon after site
was hit and Lewenz kept driving 23 miles to
El Atnntillo. on the Honduran border.
