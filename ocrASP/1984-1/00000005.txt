Perrin clarifies role of SA su

constitution, election policies, and
problems involving the Executive
Branch of SA, much like the type of
power the Supreme Court of the
United States has.

“We (the Supreme Court) don't
operate in any judicial sense at all.
Our entire function is within SA,"
according to Perrin. “We mediate
problems or disputes that fall under
the SA umbrella." One such inci-
dent was disqualiﬁcation of SA
President candidate Joe Rannl.
Ranni was disqualiﬁed from the

tion is so little-known. Perrin, now
a graduate student, is the Chief
Justice of the Student Association
Supreme Court, a powerful body
which has jurisdiction over many
internal policies of the Student
Association.

“lfyou went out and intc'rviewed
anybody on campus and asked
them ‘What is the Supreme
Court?', they wouldn‘t know we ex-
isted." said Perrin. Yet the
Supreme Court has the power to
,rule on issues concerning the SA

Court for failing to exercise due
care in the removal of illegally
copied campaign posters.

But disputes such as the Ranni
case are few and far between. Ac-
cording to Perrin, he has only been
involved with three or four major
incidents during his three years with
the Court. “I think the lack of use
may be because we‘re not a
publicized branch of the govern-
ment." said Perrin, although he
stressed that the Stiprcmc Court is
available to any SA funded group if

they have a legislative problem. .“l
try to get them to try to resolve their
problem with an SA internal group
or to see Rich Schaffer or Jeff
Schneider."

Perrin also notes that SA tries to
resolve its own problems before it
comes before the Supreme Court.
“I attribute the lack of cases to the
Executive Branch (of SA) trying to
keep things out'of the court due to

‘simplicity. The Executive Branch

tries to handle things internally.
“It's not done maliciously,” said
Perrin. ' '

Although Perrin says he believes
that .SA has the interests of the
students at heart he does have some
criticism for the organization. “I
think that they’re trying to do their'
best for the students but they (SA)
are pursuing too many topics, and
not enough concentration is being
put into any one of them." Perrin
said SA should focus issues “more
directly internal to SUNYA," such
as the proposed mandatory bus fee
and SUNY budget cuts..

Perrin also feels that too much
energy is spent on the campus poll-
ing place. “In trying to fight what
seems to be an injustice of sorts, SA
has lost sight of what's really hap-
pening. l'm a little discouraged with
the direction it's taken." he added.

Perrin said he was also against
SA’s offering free drink coupons to
students who write letters to their
legislators regarding the possibility
of changing the state drinking age
to 21. “I told them flat out that l
was against what I call ‘bribc-a-
drink.‘ II' the students are going to
be responsible enough to write these
letters, then the free drink wasn't
necessary," he said. Perrin approv-
ed ol' a free soda at the Ratliskellar
or a discount coupon for the
bookstore. “It (the free drink
coupon) clieapened the effect of

what they were doing," he said.

As SA's Supreme Court Chief
Justice, Perrin is the ﬁrst person
contacted if the need for a hearing
arises. His job then is to contact all
parties involved, counsel them as to
the proceedings of the court, and
preside over the hearing. Other than
the hearing aspect of the position,
Perrin consults at times with the Ex-
ecutive Branch of SA. "In the
United States, the Supreme Court is
much more apolitical...you
wouldn't ﬁnd the Chief Justice
meeting with the President to
discuss policies," said Perrin.

In addition to his position on the
Supreme Court, Perrin is also a 2
year member of the AMIA council,
a Public Safety Student Patrol
supervisor, and a substitute teacher
in ‘history at Guilderland's Parn-
sworth Middle School. “I really en-
joy teaching," he said, but he has
not ruled out other fields, such as
law. But he says he would “never”
work in Politics.

“l'm a very patient person for

premef court. juStice

some things and l'm a very impa-
tient person for other things. I
don't know if I would have the pa-
tience to deal with some of the
things that the legislators deal
with,” he said.

Before becoming SA’s. Supreme

Court Chief Justice, Perrin was
turned down all the Quad Boards
of both Indian and Dutch Quads.
He noted that his position on the
Supreme Court was a political deci-
sion by former SA President Dave
Pologe. Current SA President Rich
Schaffer has assigned him to
another term.

Before he retires, Perrin would
like students to realize that the
Supreme Court is a “viable
resource" to them, either through
membership (applications come out
every fall) or through direct usage.
“A lot of people just don't know
we‘re there.” Perrin said he can be
reached through the SA office. He
urged students to go to the Supreme
Court if they cncountcpproblcms
with an SA funded group. i l

Screening program for malig

By Lisa Strain

corvrrrrrrurrrvo EDITOR

Moles on the skin may seem
tiivial, but they can be fatal.

Melanoma, sometimes found iii
moles. is the fifth major cause of
cancer death In the IS to 34 age
group, and is now increasing in the
United States at a rate greater than
any other form of cancer, except
lung cancer, according to the pig-
ment lesion study group.

Melanoma is a form of skin
cancer that is derived from cells that
make up common moles.

A free screening program for
anyone concerned about a mole is
being sponsored by Dr. Lee
Zehngebot of the Division of On-
cology, and the Pigmented Lesion
Study Group of Albany Medical
College. The screening sessions are

scheduled for January 3t and
February I from 6-9 pm. each
night at the Student Health Services
building.

Patients attending either session
will fill out a questionnaire on their
skin history and will be examined
by either Dr. Zehngebot or Dr.
Judith Mysliborski, a dermatologist
at Albany Medical College and an
alumnus of SUNY Albany.

Early changes in a pigmented
area of the skin that suggest a
malignant melanoma are a change
in the color ofa mole with irregular
areas of blue, black and/or gray
pigmentation, or a change in 'lhc
border of a mole from being evenly
round or oval to developing ir—
regular edges, chincbot explained.
A change iii the surface of u mole
along with scaling or itching could

also indicate a malignant
melanoma. the doctor added. A
person with an abnormal mole does
not necessarily have melanoma, he
explained. -
According to Zehngebot,
"Melanoma is a disease which when
found early on the skin can be
cured. When it's found later it fre-
quently spreads." Early recognition
cart lead to a very high cure rate,
while late recognition greatly in-
creases mortality, Zehngebot said.
“People with increased risk of
melanoma have moles that don‘t
muturc normally, they stay tint and
don‘t become raised," said Dr.
Zehngebot. Moles following the
natural growth process rise with
Iigc, whereas abnormal moles stay
Ilat, according to Zehngebot.
Physicians have recently describ-

ed a new syndrome consisting of a
pattern of distinctive moles,
especially (but not always) in family

members of melanoma patients, tic--

cording to the Pigmented Lesion
Study Group. If someone has two
family members with melanoma
and also has an abonormal mole,
“there is almost a 100 percent
chance over (his/her) lifetime of the
person developing melanoma,"
said Zehngebot.

Zehngebot outlined some of the
problems with screening for
melanoma. “Melanoma is it unique
cancer because it's on the skin." he
stiid. People over 45 tire more likely
to be concerned about moles and to
go in for an examination than
younger people who “may have
wanted to go to a dermatologist and
never got around to it." said

nant moles planned.

Zehngebot.

According to Zehngebot, "There
must be a number of people on
campus either' with early
melanomas or abnormal moles."
Zehngebot is a member of the Plan-
ning Committee foe Melanoma
Study in cooperation with Hood.
The Planning Committee, compris-
cd of students and administrators,
has been formed to organize a
melanoma study on ,the SUNY
Albany campus. ,

Any student concerned about a
change in a mole should attend one
of the free sessions. “This is a very
visual story, the kind of thing you
hear about and it means very little.
You see it and it‘s very dramatic,"
said Zehngebot. “The thing that 's
dramatic is that you can die from
it." i3
