> My steps are heavy. and the way slow

As I make my way forwards.
Not backwards.

Traversing an 'tncline
My burden grows.
As I must walk forwards.
Not backwards
And upwards.
Not downwards. .
E] C! C!

With each step upon the earth.
Each breath i draw.
Each swing of my arm through the air
The way becomes more strenuous ~ and
uncertain. -
But still. I delight In my progress.

‘ Cl Cl C!

Beside the path grows a splendorous flower
its beauty would enhance me
I pluck it at the stern

Its beauty seems less mine now
Than when I did not possess It.

Up ahead it Is dim

The path has clouded over
But still. I delight In my progress
And my ﬂower

 

 

 

 

 

 

I come upon a beautiful woman

1 want her

Another approaches and takes her
Driven by wrath and desire

l slay him

And seduce her

I am made better and stronger
By my conquest and my possession

The ground which was once firm beneath me
Has melted Into a thick bog

Where I am headed l see only black

i am obscured from knowing how to remain
on the path

And with each step

My strength drains away Into the murk

But still. I delight In my progress

My ﬂower

My woman

And the head of my foe she bears upon my

staff.

Proudly. l carry on
E! E!

I see a man .

Sitting beneath a small tree

Laden with riches:

Golden chains. coins. and precious stones.

My friend! I call out. you seem troubled

He lifts his eyes weartly-

Yes my friend

1 am so burdened by my wealth

That I can go on no longer with it!

What shall i do?

Perhaps we may travel together - l offer

And share the burden between us...

Gladly. he hands me a sack of gold.

With it. I strike his head

And bound him In his own golden chains

The blackness ahead closes in upon me

A frightful pall draped over my shoulders
But i look upon my slave and my woman
Laden with my riches

The beauty of my ﬂower

The head of my foe

And still. i delight In my progress

And i bask in the light of my possessions and
my power

With this light and power
i need follow no path.
l travel where l please

 

 

 

\

 

in time l find
When gazing upon my entourage
A growing disillusionment
And the darkness growing thicker
And pressing In upon me
Draining strength from my circle of light and
power
E] E! El
Weary.
l turn
Only to see
My ﬂower
My woman
My foe
My slave
My riches
And with them my progress
My power
And my delight
Disappear Into black obscurity
C] III E]

Dralned by blackness

Whipped and pummelled by winds of despair
There is nothing for me out In this abyss.

I turn my vision inwards

i search within rrlyself

For light

Knowledge

And strength

To guide me along a better path

l attend upon my spirit

And these thoughts

Scourlng the blackness within me

Which clouds my understanding

And stilles my power
iJ D E!

Possessions are an illusion of wealth!

Conquest an illusion of power!

Seduction an illusion of pleasure!

I must acquire that wealth which lay within my
heart!
1 must quash the forces which Impede my In-
ward journey!
I must renounce sensual pleasures for. the
pleasures of the spirit!

[I

Alter much time. and great effort
The winds eased
The darkness lifted and no longer pressed
upon me v
E] E] C!
With hope. I search for a path
A way to the source of true knowledge and
good conduct.
A route to my salvation

Where I once took from others
i now gave of myself.
Where I once enslaved
i now championed freedom.
Where 1 once took life
I now preserved life
Where i once indulged in the pleasures of the
flesh
| now attended upon the discipline of my mine
The purity of my spirit
And the wisdom of the sages

The darkness gave way
To light
And clarity

The ground cleared. and became firm beneath
my feet.
And my travels were made less difficult

My soul is cleansed

knowledge

And the promise of pure conduct

Unto my soul

diva Is the life energy

lea is omnlclent consciousness

The self is a delusion of knowledge and life

Gods are jlva bound by karma
Men are iiva bound by karma.
Animals are Ilva bound by karma
All finite beings

Are pregnant with the infinite mind

Earth bodies are Iiva bound by karma
Water bodies are Jtva bound by karma
Fire bodies are Ilva bound by karma
Air bodies are jlva bound by karma
All finite bodies

Are pregnant with the Infinte mind

Uniettered by karmic matter
All Iiva participates and shares
in omniscience and liberation

To bring harm upon lea

To thwart Its quest for moksa

To condemn It to yet another round of misery
In the whirlwind of samsara:

This will bring upon the sinner '
The darkest and most burndensome of kar-
man.

As it is said-

Every action plants its own seed

Whose fruit 1 its retribution!

Human existence Is suffering,

A karmic shell

To be pierced. shattered. and shed
Only a stepping stone to moksa

Those who are led by their desires
Who are the tabernacle of fraud
Who dwell in the heap of karman
Are born again and again

Wrath. pride. deceit. and greed

These are the bearers of dark karman

Whose forces perpetuate samsara

Control and>vlrtuous conduct bear only light

karman

Whose spell can be broken in the name of

moksa ‘

Austertttes burn off the seeds of dark karman

Austerllles purtgy the soul

Renunciation carries the hero across the ford!
[Li E] El

Sin is the cause of misery. birth. and death
Wrath. pride. deceit. and greed are the causes
of sin

Delusion Is the cause of these evil Intentions
Action is the cause of this false knowledge
Action Is sln

Action tnust be comprehended

Action must be renounced!

Action is the seed of karma
Karma Is the fruit of action
Karma Is the seed of action
Action is the fruit of karma
Ceaslng all action

The wise man destroys all karma

He reaches the opposite shore
Who owns no property.

He traverses the path to moksa
Who is freed frotn attatchment

Right faith has strengthened the hero
Right knowledge has guided the hero
Right conduct has purified the hero

Perfect renunciation

Of body

0! senses

Of speech

Of mind

Of self

Of all outside pure jiva

Carries the hero across the shore

The hero is delivered
Distinctions fuse into Lmlty

Ignorance is vanquished by unmntscience

The letters of human existence are lost

In the embrace of perfect consciousness

One sun shines so brightly

That even the light of kevala is lost in its

luminosity
All light

All life

in solidarity

The end!
