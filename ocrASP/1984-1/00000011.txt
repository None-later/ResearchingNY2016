tially, opponents believe that CUB
would only be a wasteful duplica-
tion of other consumer representa-
tion organs already in place. Robert
OjBricn, Regional Director of
Public Relations for Niagara
Mohawk, said that utilities in fact
are “not afraid" of consumer
representation, but that CUB would
be ineffectual.

He cited figures from the San
Dicgo.CUB, which he said took in
some $740,000 and only used
340.000 on intcrvcning for con-
sumch in rntc hcurings. Thc rest
was uscd to i'innncc n slui‘f of
lawyers, cnginccrs and accountants.
if the function of n CUB was to in-
tcrvcnc, he concluded, then it
wasn’t doing it very good job.

Another issue for CUB op-
ponents is the proposal mcthod for
funding. CUB would advertise itsclf
and rcqucst funding through inscrts
in utility billing cnvclopcs. CUB
supporters argue that consumers
pay for envelopes and postage
already illitl legitimately, additional
costs should not amount to much.
They also say CUB would pay for
any clcricnl costs ittcurrcd by
utilities.

But O‘Bricn said clerical costs
would amount to $50,000 a motttlt,
which would break a CUB finan-
cially. He also raiscd the question
of invasion of privacy, and asked
what would stop any other groups
or organizations from demanding
the use of billing envelopes.

CUB passed the Assembly last
Monday and is currently in the

Senate Energy Committee. D

riting campaign, similar to the
held last semester. is planned,
- Schneider. Bar coupons may be
ributcd again, he added. He
nowledged that student body
osition to the bill is not
animous. “I realize some
dents are in favor of 2i, but the
jority is against it," Schneider
' .

i c complained of a lack of stu-
. t involvement on the issue. He
id that an ' Albany
cmblywoman held a meeting to
cuss the issue, which attracted 50
oplc, but no students attended.

educated campaign, consisting

"signs, mcctings and petitions"
5 been planned to inform
udcnts about the issue, Schneider

dcd.

Tierney said that tuition and dor-

itory fcc hikes arc unnecessary,
ecausc there are "pretty good
‘vcnucs" in Cuomo‘s proposed
udgct. He expects to receive

‘good help" front the Static Senate

. SASU’s effort to stop the in-

rcascs, and even “stronger” sup-
on from the Assembly.

According to Lattgdon, Fink is
pposcd to higher tuition and dor-
nitory fees. The Spcakcr, Lttngdon
‘aid, “is willing to put money into
the budget" if such action would
prevent the bikes.

Mathicu said, "we're not on-
lhusiastic about increases." Hc ad-
ded, however, that Anderson would
“have to study the budgct,” bcforc

stating his final position on fee in-
creases. He asserted that 3 disagree-
mcnt over the budget may develop
between Cuomo and Anderson. Ac-
cording to Methicn, the Governor
feels that there is no surplus, but
after a “cursory look," Anderson

thinks that there may be a budgcl‘

surplus.

in a January 16 New York Times
article, Cuomo said what his reply
would be to a student who opposed
a tuition increase. “if you wanted
no tuition increase where would you
get the money? Would you take it
from the homeless? Would you
misc a tax? And if raising a tax
would drive out a job that you were
hoping to have when you got out of

school, would you still be against a .

tuition increase?" the Governor
asked.

Schncidcr called Ihc budget pro-
posnl a "disaster" for cducation.
He said that Ccntral Council and its
Student Action committee would
attempt to dcvclop support against
the proposed increases. “SA will be
putting out a strong education cam-
paign, because most students won't
see the budch We want students to
know the fees will go up if they
don't do anything about it," he
said.

According to Schncidcr. SA will
stagc a rally some iitnc around late
Fcbruary similar to the “Fight the
Hikc" campaign hcld last year, in
which sludcnts from many SUNY
campuses lrztvcllcd to the
Legislature to protest against last
year's proposcd $200 tuition in-
crease. i i

Reagan
<3

Soviets; “if your government wants
peace-there will be peace," accor-
ding to the text.

Reagan concluded his l984 State
of the Union Address by saying that
“America‘s best days, and
dcmocracy's bcst days, lie ahead 
With faith and courage, we can per-
form grcat dccds," according to the
New York Times text.

Reagan repeatedly emphasized
God, faith and hope during his
message to the country, and
highlighted what he called the “new
beginning" that had occurcd during
his administration.

“it was more like an inaugral

speech than a State of the Union
Adrcss — more mood music than
marching ordch — but he captured
the country's mood very
effectively." said Sen. Dave Durcn-
burger, (R-Minn), according to
Associated Press rcporls.
‘ New York's U.S. senators
rcactcd along party lincs to Prcsi-
dcnt Rcugun‘s State of the Union
Address Wedncsday night,
disagrccing in Ihcir appraisal of tile
administration‘s handling of the
federal budgct, according to wire
reports.

“Would that the stoic of tile
union was as rosy as the president
suggests," said Scn. Daniel Patrick
Moynihun, (D-N.Y.). “With $200
billion dci’icils looming, in David
Stockman's words, ‘us far as the

eye can sce,’ it is fantasy to suggest
our problems are behind us. They
lie ahead," he told Associated Press
reporters.

Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amnto,
(R—N.Y.), praised the speech, back-
ing Reagan's opposition to
Democratic plans to raise taxes in
order to cut the deﬁcit, according to
the wire service. "He's done more
for New York by seeing our private
sector has grown than those who
scream and yell about budget
deficits,” D'Amato said. "We're a
not gainer undcr Ronald Reagan,"
he continued.

"He’s the only man who can pro-
vicc leadership on the deficit pro-
blcm." said Senate Democratic
Lcadcr Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia, according to the wire scr-
vice. "He needs to make some
spccifics known. He needs to make
some proposals himsclf. if he wants
bipartisan action, wc nccd to all
share in Ihc burden," uddc ' liyrd.

House Republican Lcndcr Robert
H. Michel of lllinois, wltilc warm in
his praisc for Reagan‘s presenta-
tion, fclt achieving the $100 billion
in cuts suggcslcd by Rcagan would
be difficult, said the wire service.

Democrats claimed Reagan gavc
loo litllc attention to lhc Lebanon
crisis, according to the Associated
Press. l l

  
 

Voter drive
<Front Page

Despite the Supreme Courts rul-
ing. Shaffer feels students are
“getting a bum deal from local
politicians." At present, two of
the four polling places for
SUNYA students are located on
campus, and politicians, accor-
ding to Schal'fcr, are intentionally
denying students additional on-
cnmpus polling places, in an at-
tempt to disenfranchisc SUNYA
students.

The voter turn out rate for on
:ampus voters during the last clec-
tion was 53 percent for State
Quad, and 4t percent for lndlan
as opposed to a 25 percent rate for
students. off-campus, added
Schaffcr.

NYPIRG, which has registered
i00,000 voters in the last ten
years, is particulary concerned
about young people and
minorities, said Klos. Of the 28
million eligible voters bctwccn the
ages of cightccn and twcnty cight,
only 12 million votcd in the i980
elections, and only i.5 million of
the 5.5 million cligiblc block and
hispanic youth voted in Ihc last
presidential race.

The national sludcni con-
fcrcncc on Voter chistralion is a
project of the student public in-
terest groups, (PIRG'S). Thc con-
ference, according to Klos. is
February 12, and is open to all
who wish to attend. Conference
organizcrs hope to have about 500
sludcnts in uttcndnncc, us well as
several presidential cundidatcsI]
