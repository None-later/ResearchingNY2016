record falls to

B Adam Goodman
smr‘r WRITER

The Albany State men's swim team drop-
ped their dual meet record to 3-3 following
losses to Potsdam and Hamilton last week.

in Potsdam, the Danes were facing the
defending SUNYAC champions. a team with
considerably more depth and experience.
Although in defeat. Albany turned out in
perhaps its bestgoverail performance of the
year, losing 58-54. in a contest that was
undecided until the final event. in fact.
Albany held a 54-51 lead entering the final
event, propelled by many personal and
seasonal best times.

The afternoon began in exciting fashion,
as Albany was just touched out in the 400
medley relay. Ted Obcr and Jeff Kennedy
each recorded seasonal best split times in
their respective legs. The team of Ober and
Kennedy later came back to sweep the 200
l.M.. with times of 2:08.47 and 2:08.56
respectively.

Albany's distance freestylcrs enjoyed ex-
cellent afternoons, as they swept both the 500
and 1000 freestyle events. Co-captain Frank
Parker, who earlier recorded a personal best
in the 200 freestyle (1:55.55). teamed with
Mike Wright in the 500 free, with seasonal
best times of 5:19.09 and 5:20.94 respective-
ly. in the 1000 free. Jeff Ball broke the 11
minute mark for the first time ever, with a
time of 10:57.41. followed by Frank Cawley
with a time of 11:15.26. The team of Ober

'tind Kennedy. who were already enjoying an

excellent afternoon, split tip. as Obcr won the
100 breast (1:014) and Kennedy won the 100
back (1:00.61). Tltc abundance of personal
and seasonal best times was attributed to
hard work. as the Danes travelled to sunny
Florida over break to get in shape for tltc rest
of the year.

Unfortunately. as a result of this strenuous
but essential work. Aibtiny left their

Potsdam's victory in the final event, the
freestyle relay. that gave them the victory.
Nevertheless. Albany coach Joe Shore main-
tained the demeanor of a coach who was very
satisfied.

"l'm very satisfied with the wltole team."
said Shore. who in only his second year, has
made tremendous strides with his team. in
fact. last year. Potsdam defeated Albany by
54 points, an excellent indication of the
Danes' resurgence.

Face Hamilton Next

On Tuesday, the Danes hosted another
strong team. Hamilton. When news hit
Albany that following the Potsdam meet,
Hamilton defeated Potsdam by a wide
margin, Coach Shore realistically realized
that he was to be given an opportunity to
place his swimmers in races that they were
not accustomed to; in essence to experiment
with his team, while still remaining com-
petitive. Shore's free hand enabled Mark
Liebowitz to make his debut in the 100 free.
with a respectable time of 54.68. Mike
Wright, swimming in his first 1000 free. took
second place. Ober. primarily a breaststroke
and individual medley performer. broke the 2
minute mark for the first time. He also
managed to win the 200 breaststokc, with an
excellent time of 2:21.01, :1 time which Coach
Shore feels may be the best tintc in the
SUNYAC this year.

Jeff Ball had an excellent day. which was
capped by his tintc of 5:12.94 iii the 500 free.
cclipsing his personal best by 5 seconds.
