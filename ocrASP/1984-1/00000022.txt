“There is now an appreciation by the state
government of the need for repairs to the ina
trastrueture of these buildings]: ,Not enough
funds are available. however the need for
these allocations is appreciated." Thompson
continued. \

The increasing need for repair and
rehabilitationexpenditures stems from the
fact that the majority of the buildings in the
SUNY system were built within a small time
frame, according to Thompson. “All these
buildings were generally built in the 1960’s
and 1970's. They will all age in a similar time
frame. Therefore, we see the same problems
arising in many different structures," he
said. . ' '

The money allocation to Albany will be
spent on the replacement of the roofs of the
Earth Science. Fine Arts. Administration.
Business Administration, Performing Arts,
Physical Education and inﬁrmary buildings.

"This has been a long term project." said
Dennis Stevens. director of the university's
physical plant. "This was requested by the
campus after extensive review by university
officials and an outside engineering ﬁrm.
These repairs are crucial to the preservation
of the intrastructure."

“it is crucial to the university that we are
able to make use of all our facilities. We at
this university have a huge investment in
education, and if we cannot utilize office
space or classrooms because of a roof that
needs repair. then that is a sacrifice that We
cannnot afford to make. it is very important
that we are able to make use of all our
facilities." Stevens elaborated.

Stevens illustrated several examples of
buildings in which extensive water leaks have
caused major problems. including damage to
the Library. the Criminal Justice building,
and many of the downtown dorms. "We
have already made extensive repairs to the
downtown campus and to several academic
buildings on the uptown campus." said
Stevens. “This would be the final stage in

r

repairs to these roofs, on the podium. This-

money has been requested, for three and a
half to four years now.”

The new root‘s would serve two functions,
according to Stevens. “Not only would the

new roofs fufiii their primary goal in preserv- ‘

ing the buildings from further damage. they
would also be extremely beneficial to the
university in terms of energy consevation.
The old roofs are now so cracked and water-
filied that they are no longer adequate
enough to retain heat. The new roofs are con-
structed to insulate the buildings much bet-
ter," he said. r

The money has currently been proposed by
Governor Cuomo as part of his 1984 ex-
ecutive budget. The budget is now under con-

sideration by the State Legislature. Should it

be approved as part of the overall operating
budget, the funds would not become
available ttntil April. according to a Cuomo
press representative. El

to form its core and to develop a reputation
with which to procure outside grants and
contracts, he explained. The Federal govern-
ment has been one of the largest outside
splines, giving grants to the A.S.R.C.
through such agencies as the National
Science Foundation.

Private corporations are a source for out-
side funding as well, according to Vonnegut.
“Companies might wish to have research
done,” he explained, “but it cannot be done
in an academic, department." That is an ad-
vantage for having A.S.R.C., Vonnegut add-
ed. "it has more flexibility." .

“it is very difficult to do research at a state
university,” agrees Shumaker. because of
state policies and state auditing. University
policies are, also. a problem sometimes, he
added. Another function of Shumaker‘s of-
fice has been to act as liason between
A.S.R.C. and the administrations of both th

state and the university. t.I

extra money in the budget no posi-
tions will be eliminated. he explain-
ed. in fact. Teirney maintained,
there will be an increase of 127 posi-
tions SUNY wide. This averages to
about four new positions per cam-
pus, few of which will be faculty
positions, he said.

“The tuition increases will hurt
university access if they are not
stopped.” commented Tierney. Na-
tional studies have shown, he said.
that for every 10 percent increase,
two percent of the undergraduate
students are forced to leave school.
These students may be replaced by
wealthier ones. but it is the students
in lower economic brackets that will
be hurt. he claimed.

Presently, the overall cost of at
SUNY education is approximately
$5,500 or more including books.
and other expenses. Tierney com-
pared this as being equivalent to
buying a new economy car every
year. .

Along with tuition increases,
Tierney pointed out that President
Reagan has cut federal financial aid
21 percent in the past three years. '
Tierney said that this means that
there is $500 million less availavle
for financial aid that three years
ago.

Fryer noted that the governor has
said that in an ideal world he
wouldn't raise tuition. he would do
away with it. However, he pointed
out that this isn't an ideal world.

Fryer said that Cuomo feels faced
with the ’book of hard choices.‘ in
order to raise the money, one must
increase taxes or take it from other
areas. he added.

Fryer pointed out that the costs
of education in all public institu-
tions is increasing nationwide.
"Viewed in context of the alter-
native. private education. public
education is still reasonable," said
