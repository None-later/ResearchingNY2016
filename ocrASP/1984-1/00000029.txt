New treatment for chronic headaches
offers more'relief than clinical help

, By Suzanne Murphy

New studies conducted by resear-
chers at the University's Center for
Stress and Anxiety Disorders have
led psychologiststhere to conclude
that home-based non-drug treat-
ment ' programs for chronic
headache'sut‘t‘crers offer as much,
and in some cases more, relief than
similar clinic-based treatment pro-
grams.

Researchers at the center com—~
pared the results of the home-based
treatment that they designed with
results of the. traditional clinic-
based treatment. Both home-based
and clinic-based patients were
taught by clinic therapists the relax-
ation and biofeedback techniques
used in treatment. ‘

However, according to the direc-
tor of the center Dr. Edward Blan-
chard. “The patients in the ltome
program are required to spend con-
siderably less time with a therapist.
With the help of specially designed
manuals and tapes. patients could
conduct the exercises at home.”

Other researchers have done
studies comparing the two types of
treatment, but have been far less

successful than the Albany

researchers. This is because, accor-
ding to Blanchard. the other pro-
grams lacked almoét any “one to
one" contact between the patient
and the therapist. '

“The treatment takes about four
months. then we follow up on the
patient intensively, once a month
for a year. If the patient has a
relapse we will bring him back to

the clinic for a booster program,”'

said Blanchard.

Relaxation training requires the
patient to concentrate on and relax
various muscle groups in the body.
In biofeedback training patients
learn ltow to raise the temperature
in their hands through mental cf-
fort. “Warming the hands has been
shown to help with headaches, but

it is not yet understood why,"_

noted Blanchard.

The Center is making tapes and
manuals for the home-based pro-
gram available to individuals
because it is important that live in-
struction be conducted between the
patient and therapist.

“Home treatment is mttch more
cost effective," says Blanchard,
“because patients spend less time

with the therapist." Blanchard
noted that the cost for one session

,with a professional therapist can

run up to 575. while. “Our tapes
cost about two dollars to make and.
at 10 cents a xer'ox copy for the
manuals, the home~based program
will become less expensive."

The Center for Stress and Anxie-
ty Disorders is the largest research
center in the country devoted to
non~drug treatment of stress related
disorders. According to Blanchard.
the Center concentrates on four ma-
jor problems: adult headache, child
headache, hypertension. and _, ir-
ritable bowel syndrome.

The Center’s chronic headache
treatment program is open and free
to the general public. An individual
must undergo a neurological scrcen-
ing to determine the cause of the
headaches. If they are not dtte to
physical causes. the person may be
accepted to the program. The clinic,
which is open front 8 ant to 8 pm.
Monday through Friday. is located
at the downtown campus of
SUNYA in room 107 at Draper
Hall. The number to call for addi-
tional information is 455-6294. 1']

According to Murray. the
research agreement allows Digital to
obtain research when it would not
be cost-effective for the company to
hire researchers and adequate sup-
port staff with complete facilities
for them. “They essentially tie up
with some research that’s (already)
going on," he said. .

Murray said that both his

1
research and Balaban's would have
continued even if the Digital deal
had not worked out. “No one is
tailoring the research to please
DEC," he said.

Shumaker pointed out that the
research will require only two of the
96 newly acquired terminals. leav-
ing 94 available for administrative
and teaching functions.

Approximately 35 new terminals
will be placed in Fulton Hall on
State Quad as part of an attempt to

make computers more accessible to
students, said Assistant to
Shumaker, ’Fran Stevens. She said
thatspecific estimates on the costs
of renovations and equipment for
the user room had not been receiv-
ed, but that she expected the room
would be open in about two mon-
ths.

The State Quad user room plan is
the ﬁrst program in which the
University will place terminals

Donald Blinken, chairman of the
Board of Trustees of SUNY and a
member of the commission said
that the commission is a “comch
tent and well-balanced" group.
“This will give us a chance to step
back and look at the university
through contpetant and objectch
eyes." continued lilinkcn. He said
that the commission would provide
“an outside view" of the SUNY
system.

Davidson said that “lltis‘look at
SUNY is vital.“ Hc maintained that
the “important asset" of “human
capital" was not managed as well as
it could have been “over the past
few years."

“Education is on the front
burner in virtually all of the 50
states," according to Euarson.
Ettarson called governance of the
state university system a key issue of
higher education. “Not only inter-
nal governance. but how the univer-
sity in entirety fits into the scheme
of things in the state government."

“The basic issues (of higher
education) are being debated in

said Euarson. He added that Gover-
nor Mario Cuomo had indicated his
support of the commission in his
State of the Slate address.

The members of the commission
were chosen by Wharton, along
with the Board ot‘.Trustecs. Whar-
ton said. Hc said that he received
“a variety of suggestions from
within and out of SUNY" as to
possible commission members.

The 15 members of the commis-
sion on the Future of the State

ton.

The cost of the commission
would be supported largely by
grants from the Ford Foundation;
Rockefeller Foundation, Cargcgic
Corp., and the Ford Motor Fund.
said Wharton. He stated that he
had received $l15,000 front these
grants, and that commission
tnembcrs will not receive compensa-
tion.

Aside from the 15 members of
the commission, there will be an ad-
ditional staff of four or five people,

said. ~ -
Terminals in the user room will

be able to work with either the new

DEC—20 or the Sperry-Univac l 183.
SUNYA's current mainframe com-
puter.

Martone explained that State
Quad was chosen because there was
sufficient room available. the
Fulton Hall lower lounge was not
set up as a study area and that
Residential Life wanted to make
State Quad “more attractive" to

'upperclassmen. The quad is tradi-

tionally a freshman quad, but Mar-
tone denied that the quad’s
stereotype had anything to do with
the choice.

Martone said that locating user
rooms on any other quad was still
only a possibility because the school
simply doesn‘t have enough ter-
minals at this time. He maintained
that ifa way was found to purchase
enough terminals a user room
would be established on eitlter
Dutch or Indian Quad.

The DEC-20 is considered an ex-
cellent computer for use by people
without a lot of expertise in the
field. both Shumaker and Wolfe
noted. “The system is designed to
be very user-friendly. it's easy to

'A State Quad user room ls planned.

Shumaker Is looking to Involve as
many students ’as possible with
computers through the DEC-20.
"We hope to attract students from
the humanities and social sciences
who might not ltave access to com-
puters." he said.

Nirenberg said the new system
would be beneﬁcial for several
reasons. "It will support a large
number of terminals," she said.
and added that this will mean
shorter turn-around time, or the
time required for a program to
finish running or printing, and the
time required for the terminal to
respond to a user‘s commands.

Nireubcrg continued. “Students
will be meeting a system that‘s quite
a bit different in quality titan the
Sperry."

According to Wolfe. the DEC-20
is not replacing the Sperry, but sup-
plementing it. She said the service
contract on the Sperry, which the
University rents, expires in
Dccetnbcr, 1986 and at that time it
will be replaced because
maintenance costs would become
too high.

Wolfe said that it is standard
practice for a school to replace the
main frame every 5-7 years to keep

up with advances in technology.

The Sperry was originally rented
by SUNYA in 1968, and the con-
tract was extended in 1974, 1979.
and 1983, Shumaker said.

Shumaker said the school would
purchase a new system in conjunc-
tion with the other University
centers and SUNY-Central. The
research for a new system is just
beginning. and both Shumaker and
Wolfe said that the new system
could end up being a Sperry.

Many schools use DEC-20
systems. according to Nirenberg.
who said she visited user rooms at
Columbia, Brandeis. M.l.T.. and
Carnegie Mellon Universities, all of
which have DEC-20 systems. There
is a “fairly strong group of univer-
sitics using this in the area," she
said.

One of the reasons the depart-
ment is hoping to attract students
who are not computer science ma-
jors is because the new terminals
will have full screen editors.
whereas many of the current ter-
minals are only line editors, that is
only one line of a program can be
seen at one time, explained
Nirenberg.
