‘ efore John Lennon was killed in 1980.

upcoming record. Last month, Yoko

' n't stand." John's voice is in fine form here.
peclfic references to himself and Yoko are
very evident in John's material. and it often
borders on self-indulgent. Considering the
romantic dialogue theme of the album, some
exclusive communication between John andl
Yoko is understandable. But a decent melody
can be wasted if nobody but the artist can
relate to'the song. This is the case with “l'm
Stepping Out," the tale of a househusband's
big night on the town. This potentially cute
rocker describes the banality of Lennon's
h me life in very boring detail: “Baby's sleep-

Poor lyrics hinder the effectiveness of
another Lennon track called “My Little Flower
Princess." This reggae lune recalls “Bless
You" from John’s "Walls and Bridges"album.
but doesn't work nearly as well. Syruppy lyrics
make the song come across as mawklsh:
“Forgive me. my little ﬂower princess, for
crushan your ‘delicateness." Oh. please.

The musicianship on John's tracks is ade-
quate. The album features most of the must-
:lans who played on Double Fantasy. In-
:ludlng guitarists Earl Slick and Hugh Mc-
Cracken. bassist Tony Levin and drummer
Andy Newmark. .

There are occasions where the overdubbing
done by Yoko and company is obvious. as in

 

“Borrowed Time." An added chorus of guitars
stands out and it's hard to imagine that Len-
non would not have re-recorded the song. His
electronically-altered voice shakes noticeably
and even cracks once on the chorus. ln
“Flower Princess," John can't even remember
the words at the end of the song. Count-offs.

 

impromptu speeches and comments like

album could be described as “Pee Wee Her-
man meets Nebraska." Each song seems to
have been influenced by the humor, har-
mony. and sense of fun of early rock and roll.
The album opens with "That Summer
Feeling," a song that captures the feeling of
summer so well that It's sort of scary. “When
the Oldsmobile's got the top down on

 

on it/When the flat of the land has the crop
down on it/What i now proclaim is sort of
hard to name/That summer feeling‘s going to
haunt you the rest of your life."

Jonathan seems to like singing a cappella.
He says in "This Kind of Music." “When
you're singing with nothing. heh. i like that," a
point he especially demonstrates live.

“hold it down" and “you can get out now"
throughout the album hardly support the nor
lion that these were the versions of John's
songs he intended to be on the album.

Yoko's half of Milk and Honey isn't very im
pressivc. In the late sixties. Yoko's music was
popularly regarded as little more than screams
and strange noises. Though her unconven—
tional siyllngs were ‘not appreciated at the
time. they gained a strong following in later
years. “Yoko was avant-garde before avant-
garde was fashionable," Lennon once said.
The 8-525 admitted they scrupulously studied
Ono's early work and they cited it as a major
influence In their music. Another fan of
Yoko’s Is Elvis Costello. who, along with the
5-525 and other contemporary artists, is
presently recording an album of cover versions
of Yoko's early music.

Although Yoko’s avant-garde offerings from
popularly overlooked albums like Approx-
imate Infinite Unluerse are innovative and
fascinating, her recent work is putrid In com-

nrecognized

Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers

' are the most spontaneous live band l’ve‘ ever
'seen. Jonathan careens through ideas on

stage. and his band usually manages to keep

v up with him. ’For instance. “This Kind Of

Muslc"was sung a cappella by Jonathan after
the first verse when he played recently at RPl's
McNeil Room. Jonathan used the stage as a

' percussion instrument. stomping on it to keep

rhythm as he sang. He and his band did a fun:
ny flamenco jam as well'as a hilarious version
of “Smoke on the Water." If you get the
chance to see Jonathan Richman and the
Modern Lovers, don't pass up the opportuni-
ty. it will be a fun and very entertaining even-
mg.

Afler “This Kind Of Music" comes .“The

' Neighbors." the most serious song on the

album. A beautiful duel between Jonathan
and one of the female Modern Lovers. it is the
story of a man's determination not to be in-
fluenced by his neighbors when he talks to the
neighborhood women.

“Somebody To Hold Me" Is the catchiest
song on this album of catchy songs. lts startA
and-stop rhythm and changing tempo acom-
pany Jonathan's profession of happiness since
he’s got somebody to hold.

The song that starts off the second
side.“Siop This Car." is one of the most ex-
uberant songs around. It makes the Ramones
sound like Pink Floyd. it starts fast and keeps a
pace on the edge of tripping over itself for the
whole song. The words tell the story of what it
must have been to ride with the girl from “Fun.
Fun, Fun," by the Beach Boys.

Jonathan expresses childlike enthusiasm,
innocence. and a sense of humor in "Not Yet
Three" as he sings from a little kids point of

. '

 

parison. With all due respect to Yoko, she has

I a very poor voice for conventional melodies,

which comprise the bulk of her recent albums
Double Fantasy, Season 0] Glass 'and It's
Alright.. Ono's songs on Milk and Honey are
equally disappointing.

“Sleepless Night." “Don't Be Scared.“ and
“You're the One" are weak melodies which
suffer from excessive verbiage and an un-
modulated soprano. The strength of “0 Sent-
ty" is its length. The song is about a minute
long.

“Your Hands." which features Yoko
describing, in Japanese. various partsaof her
lover's body and what they mean to her. is
tedious. Maybe Yoko's present music. like her
early work, is years ahead of its time and won’t
be appreciated until sometime in the distant
future. Don't hold your breath.

A touching surprise appears on Milk and
Honey in the form of a demo version ofa song
John never recorded in the studio. The
melody in “Grow Olcl With Me" is as beautiful
as anything John has ever written. and the
lyrics are tinged with ironic sadness: "Grow
old along with me. The best is yet to be " John
borrowed the lyrics from a Robert Browning
poem and recorded the version on Milk and
Honey In his bedroom with a piano and
rhythm box. The rough quality of the recor-
ding may be the only thing that will keep the
song from becoming another “imagine.”

Yoko offered some background on “Grow
Old With Me": “For John. ‘Grow Old With
Me' was one that would be a standard; the
kind that they would play in church when a
couple gets married. it was horns and sym-
phony time. We were working against' a
deadline for the Christmas release of Double
Fantasy and finally decided to leave the song
for Milk and Honey so we wouldn't do a rush
Job." The version of “Grow Old With Me" on
Milk and Honey was the last John Lennon
song ever recorded. .

A Demo of Yoko's “Let Me Count the
Ways." which was recorded around the same
time as “Grow Old With Me," is also included
in the package. I'm happy to say that Yoko
shines on this track. which features just her
voice and piano. ’

In short. although Milk and Honey’s
historical significance overshadows its musical
merits. i believe l can safely say that anyone
who buys the album will not be
disappointed. El

Rock

view. Jonathan's slightly awkward voice is
nicely complemented with lullaby-like back-up
vocals as he croaks. “l'm stronger than you,
you're simply bigger than me."

in another beautiful love song.“You're The
One For Me." Jonathan sings to his love that
“it's too late...You should have never come to
sea the Lovers play/because now you're the
one for me." Jonathan's voice. while it seems
to be always on key, would always seem a lit-
tle out of place If it weren't for his personal,
noncst. almost train-of—thought lyrics. He has
great skill in picking phrases that tap a whole
collection of thoughts and emotions.

ln "When l'm Walking," the last song on the
album. Jonathan expresses his love of walking
and being with himself "with nothing between
(him) and the ground." We a wandering song,
or rather a song to wander to. Ho wraps up
the album by demonstrating his walking
technique. stomping around the recording
studio saying. "like that kinda."

Jonathan Sings! is one of the most confi-
:lent. enthusiastic. and mature albums l have
ever heard. Critics seem to be standing in line
to talk about Paul Simon's “adult rock and
roll," but the guy never rocks and he's so busy
trying to'say things cleverly that it's rare that
anything gets said. Jonathan Richman's "Let-
the-cameras-roll" song writing seems so much
more fresh. funny. unaffected. and ultimately
more intelligent when compared with Paul
Simon's songs that it is a shame that Hearts
and Bones received so much attention while
Jonathan Sings! received almost none. Call
WCDB and request something off of Jonathan
Sings! or try to get it from the Record Co-op. it
is an album that deserves to be more widely
heard. Cl
