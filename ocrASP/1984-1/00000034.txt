uninterrupted rule by the Social Democrats for the past half
century!

By contrast, let us examine two bell-weather societies for
capitalist and Communist development. Japan (which has

had practically uninterrupted rule by conservatives and'

fascists in the twentieth century) today ranks 23rd in per

, capita GNP and 20m in economic-social standing among the-

world's nations. The Soviet Union (which has had uninter-
rupted rule by Communists since i917) ranks 34th in per
capita ONP and 25th in economic-social standing.

The conclusion, i think. is quite evident. Far from retar-
ding economic growth or social well-being. democratic
socialist parties have advanced these to the highest levels in
the world -— all within the framework of free and democratic
societies. Surely we have more to learn from the programs of
these parties —- the extension of public ownership. workers’
control, and economic equality — than we do from brittle,
outdated capitalist dogma.

-—-Lawrenoe S. Wittner
Professor of History

Committed justice

To the Editor:

i write this letter to express my feelings both of tragedy
and amusement regarding Timothy Taylor's response to
Prof. Wittncr on the nature of socialism. _

Taylor contends that Prof. Wittncr would be more
qualiﬁed speaking on the topic ofhistory, rather than ventur-
ing to explain capitalism and socialism. which Taylor main-
tains are “primarily economic topics, not historical ones." i
suggest Taylor register for a course in introductory history.

Socialism is indeed an economic topic, who would deny it?
But socialism likewise addresses itself to class-based
discriminations as racism, scxism. homophobism. among
others; as they stem from the antagonistic nature inherent in
capitalism. An economic system docs not only determine
whether cvcry pcrson shall be able to purchase two cars and a
television sci, or more basically to most people in the workd,
whether they shall have anything to cut; it must as well deter-
mine the social and cultural rclationships bctwcen them.
Socialism cmcrgcd from a philosophical and historical
analysis of the very nature ol' thcsc rclutionships. to admit
otherwise is but to reveal onc’s ignorancc_on the matter.

Taylor further contends that it is capitalism that has made
Japan and Germany such economically superior nations.
To this claim, i must disagree also. What had made the
Western powcrs economic bastions of wealth and prosperity,
is due to the processes of industrialization. or in the case of
Japan and Germany. rc-industrialization. This was coupled
with traditional-capitalist imperialism. which since WWll,
has manifested itself in'nco-colonialism. '

The wealth of the western world lay not in their own
resources, but in the Third World nations. amongst the vast
supply of raw material and cheap labor, which are continual-
ly exploited by our nation. as in South Africa. El Salvador.
and Bolivia.

Taylor asks why we should institute socialist economic
policies in the United States? The answer is justice. I take no
pride as an American knowing that my country allows the
exploitation of workers throughout the world, and at home.
That is why the Democratic Socialists of American (DSA) is
committed to not only political democracy. but economic
democracy; for ourselves and for all: people in the world.
Justice, that is all.

—Brian F. VanGrol

Economic balloting '-

To the Editor: 1

Most people believe correctly that the health of the
economy is an important background issue in the presidential
election year. Yet there seems to me to bc a serious public
mispcrccption of how votcrs are likely to react to the overall
economic indicators.

Analysts assume that voters will reward the president of
either party if the economy is perceived as doing well and
punish him if it’s felt the economy is not doing well. Experts
argue that in i980 a stagnant economy cost Jimmy Carter
votes and in i984 an upturned economy will help Ronald
Reagan's clcction chances. So much forlxthc conventional
wisdom. lint it hasn‘t worked that way in thc plist and there
is no rcnson why it will work likc that now.

What really happcns in prcsidcntiul elections is that
Americans turn to Republicans in hard tirncs. Democrats in
good times. Hard timcs can bc rncnsurctl by a rniscry index (a
composite of unclnployrncnl and inflation) by consurncr
disposable income, or both. Except for displaced workch in
manufacturing, the poor and minorities thcsc arc relatively
good times fur the economy so Prcsidcnt Reagan is in trou~
blc. l '

Cartcr wns repudiated at the polls in I980 bccausc he was a
Democrat presiding ovcr a sick economy. Voters wanted a
Republican for that job. in 1976 rccovcry worked against the
election of Republican Gerald Ford. The upturn was a signal
to votch to return the Democrats to power. After Democrat
Lyndon Johnson was elected on a wave of 1964 prosperity
Republican Richard Nixon was called on in i968 to get a han-
dlc on Johnson's Vietnam induced inﬂation. Nixon imposed
wage-price controls in August, I971 and was rc-clcctcd in
[972 while controls were still in effect. Voters wanted
Nixon's economic cure to continue. 4

The theory behind this voting behavior is that voters act on

 

strong attitudes about the two major parties' respective
orientations to the economy. They expect the Republicans
will govern with whatever draconian measures are necessary
because they understand better than the Democrats that our
capitalist market economy even with built in stabilizers like'
unemployment compensation and lower taxes during
downturns is not self correcting and requires regularly a pain-
ful fiscal and monetary regimen to restore prosperity. The
Republican credo is that things have to get worse before they
can get better. Usually this means high interest rates. cuts in
social programs and a period of higher unemployment than a
Democratic administration could tolerate.

President Reagan can take credit for overturning the reces-
sion of his ﬁrst two years in ofﬁce by a consumer led
recovery prompted by tax cuts that favored the rich and a
SL7 trillion ﬁve year military buildup. His $200 billion
deﬁcits and big spender budget request that in ﬁscal 1984
hovered around 24 percent of GNP, close to the total dollar
amount approved by Congress (the largest peacetime federal
budget in our history), undermines one's belief in Republican
frugality. in prior years Ronald Reagan would have labeled
such unprecedented federal spending “creeping socialism.”

Thanks to Ronald Reagan we now know, contrary to
Dcmoctatic Kcyncsians like Lester Thurow, that if job loss is
high enough and pressure for union wage concessions great
enough. the Keynesian ﬂoor under wage rates will disappear.

The Democrats are the party of the union wage and the
social wage embodied in the welfare state. For a Democrat to
be elected president the underlying economy must be perceiv-
ed as robust and healthy by the electorate. Usually more
growth rncans more revenue means more spending and
before Reagan came to office the Democrats were considered
the party of big spenders.

Most Americans ideologically ambivalent. They would like
to buy in to at least sonic of the Democrats libcral agenda-
food for the hungry. medical care for the aged. education for
the young- but seriously qucsiion how much the economy
can support. Survey data showing increased voter conﬁdence
in the economic future should help the Democrats. Happy
days are here again.

Contrary to their rhctoric, the Democrats best hope this
year is that the improved economy will overshadow the
deficits as a salient issue with most voters. They could argue
that since Ronald Reagan has so brilliantly restored
economic growth and lowered inflation we can now dispense
with scvcrc Republican fiscal and monetary austerity and
rcturn to the prevailing post-war libcral Democratic public
policy agenda so rudely interrupted by the harsh economic
conditions of recent years. As the good news on the economy
comes in votcrs might decide we can afford a Democratic
president again.

- in 1984 it will be difficult for Ronald Reagan to convince
the electorate that economic weakness. like deﬁcits, high real
interest rates and an overvalued dollar, is reason to keep him
around awhile longer. In 1980 the voters predictably elected
conservative Reagan because their priority then was reviving
the faltering economy. That’s why we elect Republicans.
Now that the economy is turned voters may decide to discard
Reagan unless the Democrats persuade voters that the
deficits are so alarming we must continue a conservatch
Republican in office another term.

A correct definitiOn

To the Editor: , ‘

I This letter is in response to the letter written about
I "Nemesis" published in the ASP sc'vcral issues ago.

Here is the definition of the Goddess Nemesis from The
Women '5 Encyclopedia of M yI/ts and Secrets. by Barbara C.
Walker:

NEMESIS: "Due Enaclmenl, " the Time-goddess also
called Dike or Tye/re. "Desliny. " She was probably derived
front Kala-Nomi. the Mother of Karma and of the wheel of
time. Many versions of the Moon and her holy groves were
cognates: Nemaa. Diana Nametana, the Celtic Nemhain.
Mcrlirr's Nl/mra. the Mother of the ancient Named or

"moon-people. "

Ovid cal/ed Nemesis "the Goddess that abhors boastful
words, " because she brought all kings and heroes down to
destruction in the and. no matter how arrogant they might
become. The Sloics worshipped her as (he world-governing
principle of Nature, which in lime reduced all things to their
component clot/rants. Even Zeus/cared Nemesis, for she was
once his destroyer and dcvourer. the Goddess who gave birth
and (loath to all gods. She was sometimes entitled Adrasteia.
the lncscapah/e one.

Ncmcsis is the Goddess of time. of fate. of birth and
death. If you are going to dci'inc the Goddess. you could at
least gii'c Hcr due respect by going to a volume on
mythology. rather than to a dictionary.

You mentioned that She is the Goddc‘ss of divine retribu-
tion. Couldn't this also be said of your ludeo-christian god?
