(COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE; The class of I984
will enjoy one of the most dramatic up-
turns in the job market in recent history.
according to two just-released national
studies. After several years of dismal
employment conditions for the naiton’s
college graduates, it appears job of fore, as
well as salaries.wil| be up significantly this
spring.

“At the B.A. level. things are going to
be» up about 20 percent," proclaims Victor
Lindquist. placement chicf at Nor-
thwestern University and author of that
school’s Endicott Report on the national
job market.

“For the first time in several years we’re
starting to see an Increase in the number
of jobs for college graduates." echoes
Jack Shinglcton, Michigan Slate’s place-
ment director and supervisor of MSU’s
annual jobs forecast. Although MSU's
study in noticeably more conservative —
Shingleton expects only a five pcrccnt in-
crease in the number ofjob offers —- both
jobs forecasts cxpcct I984 grads to fare
far better than their predecessors in I982
and I983. ‘

“The market ovcrall is bouncing han
from this two-year decline we‘ve been go-
ing through," notes Lindquist.

Besides thc predicted 20 percent in-
crease in job opportunities for four-year
grads, Lindquist says. “the market will
also ‘bc strong at the ntustcr’s level. up
about 28 percent over last year. The
largest incrcasc itt all areas is at the
master’s level in cnginccring." he adds.
“Thc Double [3' (clcctricttl cnginccring)
dcgrcc is going to bc tltc crown prince ——
up 28 percent over last ycur — along with
degrees in the computer science area."

Shinglcton thinks those figures may be
too optimistic. but agrccs that “demand is
' stronger.“ rind that “the curve is moving

Job. market upswmg to “greet” graduatest'nre4"  

' in a positive direction for a chtingc."
“There will be a heavy emphasis on
electrical engineering and computer
science majors." he says. "although
chemical and petroleum engineers will

have a more difficult itme this year.”
The upturn has been coming gradually.
In August. I983. College Press Service
reported a growing'scnsc of optimism
among campus placement directors that
the end of the recession and the coming of
an election year signaled better times
ahead for collegiate job seekers. And tn
an October. i983 CPS article. botl.

“7.500. and accounting majors can ex-
pect‘to earn about “8,600.

Education majors at 314.779 and
human ecology grads at $13.9”. have the
dubious distinction of being the Ichst-
paid majors for the coming year. '

Even with their rosy predictions for the
coming year. however. both studies cau-
tion that graduates will still have plenty of
competition t‘orjobppenings. “It's still a
buyer’s market." Lindqulst warns. “It
will be very competitive, and if students
are going to be successful they'll have to
be aggressive in their search." El

Watt drawing big paychecks by lecturing

(COLLEGE [wars sate war; F ormcr Secretary of
the Interior James Watt is hitting the cam-
pus lecturc circuit this month, comman-
ding as much as $I5.000 in honoraria and
fees for on night. appearances. his New
York booking agcncy says. I

“(Wzttt) will bcgin lecturing us of
January. I984. at colleges including the
University of Miami. Texas A&M. For-
dham. and Mnrqucttc." reports Don
Walker with I-larryWqucr lnc..thc book-
ing agency which is scheduling Wall’s
tour. “Watt is one of the most sought-
aftcr speakers in the country right now."
Walker added. “I won't divulge exactly
what he's getting paid. btlt scvcral
newspapers hch t‘cportcd ltc collects
$15,000 plus cxpcnscs for u standard
honorarium."

Shinglcton and Llndquist accurately
predicted the upbeat results of their I984
jobs forecasts.

Geographically. Shinglcton says. the
southwest. southeast. and south central
sections of the country will have the best
job opportunities. The northeast.
midwcst. and northwest regions will be
the worst areas for job seekers.

According to the MSU study, electrical
engineers will have the highest starting
salaries - at $26,643 ——- of all four-year
grads. Starting salaries for agriculture and
marketing majors will hover around

after speakers" on the nation's campuses,
of course. Organized by environmental
groups, students at Yale, Western State
College. Baylor, Arizona and the Univer-
sity of Washington, among others, par-
ticipated in a number of “Dump Watt"
rallies and petition drives from September
through November. I98 I.

pcarancc to generate a lot of local
interest.” explained Judy Schiclds, Mar-
quctte’s assistant dean of students. Watt
"won't actually be giving a speech" when
he appears at Marquette on February
I6th, Schiclds says. “but will participate
in more of a ‘Mcct the Press’ forum.
responding to questions from a panel of
students and faculty. We expect a good
deal of media coverage. and strong atten-
ncc from students. the general public.
and special interest groups," sltc noted.

Student newspaper
Missouri. Michigan, Pcnn. Alabama.
Texas Christian. Southern Cal and
Oregon State. among others. regularly
targeted Watt for criticism during his
tenure. Ohio State students' plans to
picket a Republican fundraiscr scheduled
at OSU’s union building last February
forced the then-secretary to move the ban-
quct off campus. Now that Watt is out of
office, however, some schools are willing
to pay him to visit for both ctlucatoinul
and financial reasons.

cdltoriulists at

Schiclds won’t say Itow much Watt’s
appearance will cost the school, but she
does think it will easily sell out the
i.200-scat thcatrc where Watt will speak.
Students "probably" will pay $2 to $3 a
ticket. she adds.

Among some of the other popular
speakers this year. says Walker, are
former Prcsidcnt Gerald Ford, former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and
former West German Chancellor HcImu
Schmidt. D
