College Democrats at the. University of
‘Delaware basked in success and optimism.

Two weeks later. the_,local election
board informed them that all l.856
signatures had been rejected because the
group failed to proved the signers were

permanent residents of the state. At about ,

the same time. 3.000 .Rutgers students
learned they wouldn‘t be able to vote

much bigger problem than student
apathy. '

“it really is a big mess." laments Kathy
Downey. who just completed an in-depth
study of studentvoter registration pro-

Fund (NSEF). "It's really discrimination
against students by the local election of-

(COLLEGE mass SERVICE] it was an NCAA
convention that once again demonstrated

as difﬁcult as mixing oil and water.
Aspart of an ongoing internal move-
ment to reform the NCAA (National Col-
legiate Athletic Association). delegates to
the. convention here January 9-“ turned
down an effort to revise academic stan-
dards for athletes and. perhaps more im-
portantly. then handed a resounding
defeat to a group of college presidents
that wanted to wrest control over the
orgahiztion form its current governors.

The presidents wanted to form a
44~membcr board that would have had
power to adopt new NCAA rules and

' abolish existing bylaws independently of

the annual convention.

The presidential group. aided by the
A rican Council on Educaiton (ACE),
grew out of the turmoil of recent college
sports scandals of coaches doctoring
athletes’ transcripts to make them eligible
to- compete. i'launting other academic
standards, and working with booster
groups to pay athletes illegally.

is coming-

tually change the results of an election ——
they put as much in the way (of students
registering) as possible."

“in some states you can just mail in
post cards and you'reregistered.” notes

Owen McKinney, director. of the USSA’s .

voter registration drive. “in other states.
you have to be deputlzed and live in the
county to be certified to register people."
she continues. “The key to avoiding pro-
blems is to provide project participants
with extensive training and information
on local election laws." ~

McKinney acknowledges “there will be
some problems" with regional election
commissions. but adds “we'll be working

directly with the ACLU (American Civil ~

Liberties Union) to provide legal backup"
when such conflicts occur. ,

Students have had clashes with local
election boards ever since lil-year-olds
received the right to vote in 1972. One of
the first. and perhaps themost notable
confrontations between college students
and a local elction board occurred in
197g when Texas officials disqualiﬁed
over 500 Prairie View A&M studetns from
voting locally. Election officials said
students had to own property, have fami-
ly, work. or pay taxes locally to vote.
Texas law. however, defines “residence”
only as a “fixed place of habitation.” and
the US. Supreme Court ruled in l979 the
Texas officials had unfairly placed an ex-
tra burden on students that it did not im-
pose on non-students.

 
 
 
 
   
   
 
   

Although mest student activists hailed

the Texas decision as a precedent-setting
case which would end future discrimina-
tion against student voters, it hasn't stop-
ped the current conflict at the University _
of Delaware and other places. “it's really
blown up now," said Ken Weinstein. head
of the University of Delaware College
Democrats. "The state attorney general is
suing the local department of elections on
behalf of the students. and the ACLU and
AFL-ClO have also jumped in on our
side."
. “Getting students registered is a big
problem everywhere," noted Bill Morton.
staff and voter registration director for
the College Democrats national chapter in
Washington. DC. “lt’s particularly a
problem when you're dealing with a high
percentage of minorities in southern
states.” Morton hopes to minimize
hassles with local election ofﬁcials by
making sure student workers and
volunteers are briefed thoroughly on local
election laws and requirements
beforehand. »

Similarly. the national PlRG campaign
to register students “will place really big
emphasis on going through the right chan-
nels to get people registered.” sayd Beth
Pardo. a member of the Massachusetts
PIRG which is coordinating the national
registration drive. To drill student
volunteers on such “basic” information,
l’lRQ coordinators are planning a na-
tional convention and training seminar in
early February. Pardo says. _
