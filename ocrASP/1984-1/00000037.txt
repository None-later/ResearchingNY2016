For the second time this season,
the Albany State men's swim team
defeated their Capital District rival.
the RH Engineers. by an identical
score of 64-49. Tuesday afternoon
at University Gym.

This time. however, Albany put
RPl away early, as they rolled to
their third straight victory over the
Engineers dating back to last year.

Albany, behind the team of Jeff
Kennedy. Ted Ober. Bill Meier. and
Fred Greenbaum. won the opening
400 medley relay, vaulting the
Danes to an early 7-0 bulge. Jeff
Ball and Frank Parker then com-
bined for perhaps Albany's ﬁnest
victory. in the NOD free. Ball ﬁnish-

;l first with a personal best of
0:57.0. a whopping 7 seconds bet-

ter than his previous best. Co-
captain Parker finished second with
his personal best, only two seconds
off the lead. Albany then dropped
the 200 free and the 50 free, but
they managed to capture second
and third in each event, thus drOpp~
ing only 2 points off their lead.

“Our depth has really increased.
which enabled us to hang on tough
even in races that are not our
strongest," said coach Joe Shore.
Then Kennedy. who earlier set his
personal best in his split of the
medley relay, took the individual
medley with a good time of 2:08.44.
The Danes then again held their
ground. taking second and third in
the 100 fly and too back.

in the latter race. Ober bettered
the 1 minute mark for the first time
(59.37). and Ball recorded a

seasonal best of 1:02.04. But it was
the 500 freestyle that iced the vic-
tory for Albany, as-Tom Handy
and Frank Cauley teamed for a l-2
finish, to increase Albany’s lead to
an insurmountable 54-34 lead, with
3 events left.

Diver Mike Vardy added insult to
injury with a victory in the 3 meter
diving (l97.50). in what would be
analogous to basketball's garbage
time, Ober won the 100 breast
(1:03.73), with a strong showing
from Dean Wilson (1:09.37). The
rest was academic.

POOLSle NOTES: Albany will

Women track'sters open

with 3rd place finish

By Jim Erwin

The Albany State women's in-
door track season got underway last
Friday as the team traveled to Cot.

=[tland for a ﬁve way meet. The
"Danes finished third with team

scores as follows: Co'rtland 941/2.
Blnghamton 28, Albany 16. Alfred
15%, and Eric l4. The third place
finish was quite respectable as the
Danes did not take a full team to
Cortland. Coach Ron White did not
want to force individuals not ready
or injured to run this early. Coach
White stated. f‘This meet was a get
started type meet. I'd like to bring
the girls along slowly to try to avoid
injuries and have them peaking dur-
ing late season." For this reason the
Danes operated at just over half
strength.

Impressive in Early Season

The Danes had quite a'fcw im-
pressive early season performances.

Docharty's one-two ﬁnish in the

tion with a jump of 4'8" and
Docharty followed with a jump of

pressive in the 3.000—mcter run.

freshman Mary Carmody took a
strong third in a time of l:05.8.

Mary Randlcs took third place in
the shot put with a throw of 32'5".

in the 5,000-meter run, a grueling
25 laps around Cortland's track.
Donna Burnham ﬁnished fourth
with a respectable early season time
to 19:54.8. '

Future Looks Promising

All in all. the women were pleas-
ed by their performance and are
looking forward to the near future
when they will be competing at full
strength.

if all goes well for Coach White
and the Danes. this year's women's
squad looks quite promising. There
are a record thirty individuals out
for the team and Coach White is
very optimistic. Said White, “The
women's track program is looking
up. We should be able to cover all
events this year, which we have had
trouble doing in the past." With a
number of quality athletes. a good
crop of talented freshmen, and new
found depth. this year‘s women's
team could be one of Albany’s best
ever.

it takes determination and true
character for a team to bounce back

3 after a tough loss, and that's exactly

What'the Albany State women gym-
nasts did Tuesday evening against
smith College. Coming off a loss to
lthaca last Saturday the Great
Danes showed their classy and en-
thusiastic display of ability by
trouncing their opponent l49.65 to
“9.3.

in front of the home crowd,
freshman Terri Sokol started things
off with an outstanding display in
the vaulting exercise. Her vault war-
ranted the high score of SJ. and
seemingly set the tempo for the rest
of the night’s events. The Danes'
Virginia Lockman and Karen Bailey
each followed closely with a 7.85
and a 7.6. respectively.

On the uneven parallel bars,
Brenda Armstrong's season-high
record was smashed by Anne
Thomasett, who set the new stan-
dard with an 8.05. “Anne is one of

the team leaders andit seems only

right that she be the one to set the'

mark," commented coach Pat
Duval-Spillanc. Behind Thomasett
was senior Lockman, a consistently
strong finisher, and freshman Nora
Bellantoni. who put on one of the
best performances of her young
career. ‘

Other freshmen who gained
recognition Tuesday were Carol
Bart and Karrie Brooking. each
making their debut on the collegiate
level. Bart proved her talent in both
the vault and the uneven parallel
bars, while Brooking excelled on
the balance beam and in the ﬂoor
exercise.

Brenda Armstrong also showed
trememdous prowess on the balance
beam. recording the high of 7.8.
Jennifer Cleary was a close second
with a 7.7.

A very strong showing by the
Danes in the floor exercise also con-
tributed to their victory. Elicia
Steinberg scored an event-high
8.15. while Loekman and Karen
