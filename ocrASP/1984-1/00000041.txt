Reorganization plan
dull-dos, “up Student
Affairs Department

By Eric andln
STAFF II'RITER v -

Dean of Student Affairs Neil Brown has been named the
Associate Vice President for Health and Counseling Services
as part ofa five-year reorganization plan that divides the Stu-
dent Affairs Office into ﬁve major units.

Brown asserted that the reorganization of Student Affairs
will deﬁnitely help the division carry out it responsibilities.
"I'm excited about my new area of work” said Brown.
Under the new setup. explained Brown, “I can tie together,
when desirable, programs such as Middle Earth and
Genesis." ' -

Brown cited a recent meeting of the 5-Quad ambulance
service. ‘At that meeting, noted Brown, the possibility of
training S-Quad workers to treat people in the event of a
nuclear crisis wits discussed. It was suggested that this pro-
gram include other organizations that deal directly with stu-
dent health.

In the past, said Brown, “student organizations got
together only in times of crisis.” Other groups that Brown
will be working with include the University C " .,
Center. and the Student Health Services. Brown's unit wll
also be looking into the possibility of some sort of ties with
the Chapel House.

On January 25, Vice President for Student Affairs Frank-
Pogue formally announced to the staff that their division ltad
been split into five major units: Campus Life; Health and
Counseling Services; Student Services; Academic Support
Services; and Residential Life and Student Development.

Several years ago. according to Pogrte, the department of
Student Affairs at SUNYA developed a ﬁve year plan which
outlined the goals of the department. This recent reorganiza-
tion, said Pogue.’ is part of the Student Affairs plan.

Under the plans of reorganization, each of the five units

has its own head, who‘s primary function, according to
Pogue, is to provide overall program coordination for
budgeting. planning, personnel needs, staff performance
evaluations, five year planning. and annual reports.
' The heads of the five major ttnits will report directly to
Poguc, who will be advised on University matters by a newly
created executive committee, which includes the heads of
eaclt ttnit. ’

Martone said the new structure of Student Affairs will help

vice to transcribe their iccfures. The
objections ranged from question of
copyrighting, to the unfair advan-
tage to certain students and the
possibly prohibitive cost.

“My initial reaction to the service
was a negative one," said Professor
Jogindar Uppal of the Economics
department, adding “I think that it
is unfair that someone else would be
making a profit from my lectures."
Another objection Uppal had was
that he strongly believes in the
privacy of thought. “If someone ls

transcribing your lectures, you
might not be able to teach in class
something that you would not like
to be in print,” he said.

Another objection raised by
faculty members was one pertaining
to the transcription's disruption of
the undergraduate learning process.
“I feel that note-taking is an in-
tegral part of undergraduate educa-
tion," said the College of Social
and Behavioral Sciences' John
Webb. '

“i am very concerned about

students having lecture notes taken
by'someone else. Notes are an ex- '
tremer valuable learning service In
any course. and I don't think a stu-
dent should have his/her notes
taken by someone else," he added.
He noted that you do not let so-
meone else take your tests or write
your term papers. “Transcription

and notetaking performs an essen-

tial undergraduate learning ex-
perience," he said.

Other questions that Webb raised
related to the difficulty in
transcribing lecture notes. and the
pressure on students to 'purchase
them. “One of the questions that
concerned rne was as to the pressure
that would be on the students to
purchase tltc scrvicc turd the cost in-
volvctl."

Webb ttdded that ltc does not feel
that it is right that students with
tttottcy could have nrt uttfnir advan-
tage over other students. “I also

regarding the feasibility of the ice-

Professor Peter Blorriat'l. of the
Computer Science department. “I
wasn‘t sure how useful transcrip-
tions would be in a technical cortrse
like corttptttcr science. Therefore, I
decided to wait ttntii after the trial

period before deciding whether or
not to utilize the service," he add-

ed. .

Other faculty members echoed
the idea that the trial semester Will
be a good indicator of the quality of
the transcription. "These people
are innovators," said Professor
Jack Green. “This sort of service
hasn’t been offered before. We will
see over one semester‘s worth
whether they will be useful to
students and faculty." he added.

There has been some positive
feedback to the service also.- “From
what I‘ve seen of it, the transcrip-
tion has becn excellent,“ said I’m-
fessor Josiah (‘tould of the
Philosophy department. “They
have been transcribing ttty lectures
vct'y trccurtttcly. I feel tltat this is
another study tool for students, and

Gould ttotcd iiitli if students
work actively an the course, the
transcription will be for the good.
"Students may be able to perform
better with tlte transcription if they

ed.
