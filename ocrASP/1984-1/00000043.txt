“i call on the government of
Syria. which occupies Lebanese ter-
ritory from which much of the
shelling of civilian centers originates
and which facilitates and supplies
instruments for terroristic attacks
on the people of Lebanon. to cease
this activity.” Reagan said.-

Secretary of State George P.
Shuitz. on a visit at Brazil. said the
United States is reviewing its policy
toward Lebanon in the wake of bat-
tling in the streets of Beirut and the
most severe challenge yet to
Gemayai's government:

“We are reviewing it." Sitttitz
said of U.S. policy. He appeared to
leave open the possibility of a
Marine withdrawal btti made no
speciﬁc reference to that option.

But Reagan renewed his vow that
America‘s contmitrnent to Lebanon
"remains firm and unwavering."
And his spokesman. Larry Speakcs.
urged“ reporters “not to read
anything" into Shultz' statements.

“There's been no change in the
U.S. position as regards the
multinational force." Speakcs told

r reporters traveling with the presi-

dent irt Illittois.

House Speaker Thomas P.
O‘Neill Jr.. (D-Mass) called for
rcntovirtg American Marines from
the Beirut internatiortal Airport
artd perhaps stationing them on
Navy ships offshore. He added
“there's tto question itt ttty ntirtd
that somewhere along the litre the
president will trike them out. But i
say why not now?"

Witlrottt specifically mentioning
the L600 Marines in the multina-
tiottal peacekeeping force. Reagan
said “the cotrttttitntcttt of the U.S.
to the trntiy, independence and
sovereignty of Lebanon remains

Iii-m and unwavering."

Reagan urged the Lebanese to
support Gemaycl's, latest call for an
end to the fighting and to resume
national reconciliation talks in
Geneva for a new division of
governmental powers.

State Department officials said
they had taken the position that the
United States should not get involv-
ed militarily to defend the gcmayel
government unless the Marines
peacekeepers in Beirut were directly
attacked.

The Pentagon announced later
that US. warships off Lebanon
struck back.with gunﬁre and air-
power after Marines at. the Beirut
airport had come under fire at
Beirut airport. and that one Marine
was wounded at the airport.

Gen. John Vessey. chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. told the
Senate Budget Committee. mean-
while. that “we have contingency
plans to take care of our forces." if
the situation continues to
deteriorate.

He claimed that this is not an
ideal world and people cannot be
free in a society where inhumane
values exist. "Black history has
taugltt us the painful lesson that we
have to humanize the society in
which we live." he said.

"We ltave a responsibility to pass

on good things to our children. I do

semitisrn as good things." Pognc

had plans to move the Marines to

(COLLEGE mess .rsnr'lcs; ' “if
it college girl got pregnant artd pinn-
rted on giving the baby up for adop-
tion. i think she‘d be lookirtg for
someone like me." asserts Donna
Gould of Gould and Associates. a
New York ptrblie relatiotts firm.

Gould. no newcomer to the col-
lege market after sitc_ built her
reputation by promoting the highly-
successful Preppy Handbook
several years ago. is working on
what may be the most ambitious-
rttarkcting plan of lrer crtrcer.

Site can‘t get pregnant. bttt she's
betting slte cart adopt a hairy by
sidestcpping adoption agencies attd
advertising directly to college
women who ltave rrttplatttted
pregnancies.

Gould thinks she‘s on top of an
essentially untapped market for her
and tire thousands. perhaps millions
of oi ltcr couples around tlte country
frustrated with the traditional ap-
proaclt to adoptittg cltildrctt.

But student health ccrttcr and
adoptiort agency officials greet
Gould‘s idea with mixed reactions.
nttd generally pessimistic predic-
tions of its feasibility.

"l’vc beett lookittg irtto adoption
for tire and my husband for over six
months." Gould explained. “It's
pretty sparse. You call up art adop-
tiort agency rtrtd they tell you it
could be cigltt or rtitte years (before
a child is placed with you). Well.
screw that."

instead. "It suddenly ltit tire that
tltc college market might bejust the
place to rttatclt up with a girl who
was going to ptrl lter baby tip for
adoption anyway. i realized 'Tltese
are the people who are going to get
you a baby!”

lint that reasoning is debatable.
according to several college family
planning experts.

“I'm noticing ntorc students are
keeping their children rather than
having abortions." said Diartc
Brukhardt. director of family plan
ning services at the University of
Missouri-Columbia. “But.” she-ad-
ded. “i don't rctttembcr very many
who've decided to put the babies tip
for adoption. A tttuclt larger
number of students are opting to
keep lIlL‘lr'Clllldt‘L'il artd raise them
as single parents.“

Not that tttatty college students
give their babies up for adoptiott.
she added, because either they
decide it‘s rtot the tittte to have a
child artd opt for ubotiott. or they
are corrtrttitted to having the child
and raising it for themselves.

At Vassar College. “We don‘t
usually have too rttntty students who
elect to continue art ttttplartttcd
pregnancy." agreed Nttttcy Cote of
the-school's fatttily plattrtitrg clinic.

“Most students opt for
abortion." she noted. "but it' the
person wishes to carry the child
tltrouglt to term, we refer them to

The college market may not be

quite the wealth of potentially~
adoptable babies Gould believes it
is. Cotes and Brukhardt stress.

in addition. "adoptive. parents
have to be prepared. We have a
one-year education program all

and said if a couple is willing to take
“disadvantaged and minority
children. you'll really have no pro-
blem getting a child. But if she's

Slate, too. doubt the idea that the

approve placing a eltild with them."
said .ioAnn Slate. a counselor with
the Methodist Mission Hottte in San
Antonio. Texas. which ltas adop-
tion and counseling certters nation-
wide.

“.lust getting a baby and raising
it isn't the whole plctttrc (to adop-
tion)." site said. Slate questions
Gould's “eight or nine year"
waiting period for adoptirtg a child.

--Domra Gould

rturttber of babies available for
tttlopiiott. “We work with a number
of college towns, attd it scents that
ttntottg the yonger sittgle students
today it‘s very popular to keep
children and raise them on tltier
own."

“Either tltat." Slate said. “or be-
ittg college students who are serious
about their education and careers.
many are prottc to choose
abortion."

Gould Is undeterred. “My idea is
going to work. You spend half your
life trying to avoid‘pregnancy. and
then the other half trying to get
pregnant. and it is really agonizing.
We have everything but a child. and
i'm serious when I say we'll do
aimOst anything to get one."

Towards that goal. Gould plans
to place ads in a number of college
newspapers and magazines. "and
I'd even put up a billboard if I
:ould afford it." she added.

Gould will work with an attorney
when and if any potential baby
donors appear. and says her
rrretlrod is better than sortie of the
black trtarkct services other people
rise to adopt cltlldrcn.

“Some private adoption services
charge up to $25,000. and the black
market goes even higher. At least
this way we can do everything pro-
per. und we‘d be dealing on a one-
Jn-one basis with the mother. We‘d
tee she‘s well takett cure of. and
we’d be the best parents in the
world." [.l
