and disease in the infants.

When Nestle refused to stop sell-
ing the formula in the Third World
and then wouldn't change the direc-
tions on the labels to warn parents
of the dangers, iNFACT organized
a wide range of campus, church and
civil rights groups to boycott the
company's products.

Among other accomplishments.
INFACT managed to get the World
Health Organization (WHO) to
draw up guidelines to govern the
selling of infant formula in the
Third World. I

Nestle fought back immediately.
it funded a campaign to discredit
boycott sponsors and the WHO
guidelines.

The boycott took a new turn
"when Nestle started to get very
public relations-wise" in 1982. said
Jackie Orr, lNFACT’s communica-
tions director.

"' ‘ eans criticize undergrad programs

ranked in a US. News and World
Report survey as the best
undergraduate program in thc
country.

Penn State, Gourman said. "is
competitive" with the private
University of Pennsylvania and
Carnegie-Mellon. and‘ Illinois is
“nch and neck" with the indepen-
dcttt University of Chicago.

But other states don‘t Itavc onc
college that rates above “good,” he
found.

Among them are Alabama.
Alaska. Delaware, Hawaii. Idaho.
Kentucky, Mississippi. Montana.
New Mexico, North Dakota, South
Carolina. South Dakota. Vcrmont
and West Virginia.

The best state schools. hc con-
tended, arc lndiurta. Michigan
State. Michigan, Minncsota,
Rtttgcrs, State University of New
York at Buffalo. Ohio State. Texas.
Virginia. Washington anti Wiscon-
sm. . t

The company. she recalled, set up
the Nestle Coordination Center for
Nutrition, hired former Sen. Ed-
mund Muskie to measure the firm's
compliance with WHO guidelines,

and “targetted our groups and cam- ,

puses“ with “a sophisticated. slick
public relations campaign."

in October, l982 and early 1983,
Nestle itself announced the boycott
was over. and lNFACT had to
scramble to inform its scattered
support groups the boycott was. in
'cality, continuing.

But the “bogus” an-
nouncements. Orr said. “took their
toll."

“I don't think there's any doubt
there were some campuses that had
begun to waver" in their support in
recent years. Orr said.

indeed. when Sabcy arrived in
Davis a year ago. he found “a lot of
people had forgotten about it, or
had been thrown off by press
releases."

Joltnson denies that INFACT
suspended the boycott because it
was growing weaker. “We were
building steam. (An interne'innal
infant formula conference this week
itr Mexico City) would have brought
that rnttch more pressure on Nestle.
They. upon reﬂection, determined
to pledge publicly to make a com-
mitment at this time."

The beginning of the end came
when Johnson and a Nestle official
"met by chance on rt train from
Philadelphia to Washington, and
decided they really weren't that far
apart.“ said Charming Riggs. a
Ncstlc spokeswoman in
Washington. D.C.

Nestle. Riggs explained. wanted
to abide by WHO guidelines. "but
WHO wouldn't step in to say how
to implement the guidelines.”

Another United Nation‘s agency,
UNICEF, ttgrccd to negotiate
specific steps for Ncstlc to follow
the guidelines and end the boycott.

ln Dcccmher. lNFACIT tnnde '

t‘our “final” dctttttnds on Nestle. to
bc ntct by curly February. "Nestle

initiated contact with us. and we
began talking, and those talks turn-
ed into serious negotiations," Orr
reported.

Orr added they were the ﬁrst"‘ln-

tense and direct negotiations" bet-
ween the adversalres since fall.
I982. ' v '
Since l978, when the boycott
began. as many as 200 campuses en-
dorsed efforts to ban Nestle pro-
ducts from their vending machines
and food services.

“We've never really known ex—
actly how many groups were par-
ticipating in the boycott," Riggs
said. “Five years ago a student
government votes to endorse the
boycott. but now all those people
are gone. It's still on the books. but
no one knows about it." _

Some took it off the books. Har-
vard. for one. repealed its boycott
in 1982. as did the American
Federation of Teachers. '

But many were still going at it.
Jsttt a week before Johnson
suspended the boycott. a Peoria
minister was trying to rcvivify the
anti-Ncstie efforts at lllinois State
artd Sabcy was speaking at Davis.

Davisstudcnts formed a llungcr
Task Force. and had voted to
mount a campaign to kick Ncsllc
product» off their campus.

“I was tr little bit surprised" by
Johnson's announccmcnt. Sabcy
said.

Few of thc boycotters sccm ready
to start asking schools to begin
stocking Ncstlc products again.
however.

Avoiding Ncsllc products. Orr
said. “has become an ongoing
lifestyle for some people. I‘m per-
sonally not going to encourage
unyonc to turn back to Nestle
Crunch bars for awhile.“

“It may be some tirnc before i
can drink Tttstcr‘s Choice in Nestle
product) without thinking twice."
Sabcy addctl.

Such emotional hangovers “will
tukc a while to clean up," Riggs
conceded. l"!
