In response. to SASU's and
.NYPIRO's involvement in the na-
tional voter ' registration drive
Kamishlian said that an equal con-
centration' must be made to get out
_thc vote once the students register.

Tierney stressed that students
should make sure that certain issues
are raised during the campaign,
such as the 21 peréent cut in finan-
cial did during Reagan's term.
“When students get hit in the

pocketbook they get annoyed.
when they get loaned up to the
teeth. they get annoyed." he added.

Student Assoelalon President
Rich Schaffer said that if the tur-
nout of about 15 students at the
Reagan rally last week is represen-
tative. then he does not think a lot
of students will vote for Reagan.
“Students should. and will concen-
trate on the issttcs and not the per-
sonalities," added Schaffcr.

Overall it appears that most stu-
dent leaders believe that a concen-
trated national voter registration
drive can bring about change within
the states, and possibly on the na-
tional level. Toward this goal stu-
dent leaders and news editors from
acmss the country. numbering close
to 1.000. will be meeting this
weekend at Harvard University in
Boston to outline and discuss
strategies for organizing the student
vote. ' ["l

I Washington. D. C.
{corrects mass SERVICE) Congress
reconvened recently for what some

the most important student aid ses-
sions in years.
Though Congress is not expected
to " pass many bills during this
election-year session. it will do a lot
of work toward shaping laws that
will be enacted next year.
And the laws they consider are
important ones. Lobbyists say it’s
essential to alter the Reagan ad-
ministration's emphasis on cutting
college aid programs during this
election year. when education seems
to be a hot political topic.
> 0f even more importance, they
said. will be the new Higher Educa-
tion Reauthorization Act. which
I will set limits and ceilings for aid
programs for the next ﬁve years.
“For the next six months we'll be
focusing on both the 1985 ﬁnancial
aid budget and the rcauthorization
act," said Kathy Ozer. legislative
liaison for the United State Student
' Association (USSA) in
Washington. D.C.
The Higher Education
Reauthorization Act is a congres-
sional master plan, renewed every
five years, which will set guidelines
for future Congresses in forming
aid budgets.

For ﬁnancial aid ofﬁcials who
last year finally were able to in-
crease several aid programs —
following two years of cuts and
level funding by the Reagan ad-
ministration — 1984 is the year to
catch up and make long-awaited
amendments to the nation's student
aid system.

“This is the year in which, for a
change. we won't be totally oc-
cupied just defending programs and
will have the opportunity to get
some funding increases." Ozer ex-
plained.

President Reagan, however. has
hinted broadly he intends to request
more aid cuts this year.

“Our top priority is better fun-
ding of existing programs." insists
Charles Saunders. legislative
analyst with the American Council
on Education (ACE).

“We’re expecting Congress will
reject further cuts in the 1985
budget. as they did last year." he
said. “But tlterc are still many pro-
grams which need more funding
and issues which need to be address-
cd."

Aid cxpcrts’ wish list for 1985
and for the Higher Education
Rcauthorizaiton Act includes in-

creased funding of virtually all'

financial aid programs. along with

dress the mounting long-term debt
many students are incurring.

“The most centrally-important
issue we've got to face is to bring
back into focus that there can be
some reasonable combination bet-
ween grant assistance and student
loans," said Dallas Martin. ex-
ecutive director of the National
Association of Student Financial
Aid Administrators (NASFAA) in
Washington, DC.

Whilc'grants made up over 80
percent of all student aid funding in
1975-76. grants now comprise only
48 percent of all student aid fun-
ding.

Consequently. more students are
taking out larger loans to finance
their educations. And for many. aid
officials fear the burden of repaying
those loans after they graduate will
be too great.

“Some kids are borrowing
substantial amounts of money to
get through school." agreed Janet
Hansen. associate director of the
College Board. “And i think we
really need to look at the potential
problems that could create."

USSA is so concerned about
mounting student debt problems
"we are strongly opposing any fur-
..‘cr increases on loan limits on the
undergraduate level." said Ozer.

ongress to consider financial aid budgeting "

"in addition," she said. “we
support major expansion in the

Trio programs. which are special '

service programs to provide
counseling. training and assistance
for low-income students."

Lobbyists also want to switch the
massive $2.8 billion Pelt Grant pro-
gram froma pre-set funding level to
an entitlement system which would
fund the program based on the
number of qualiﬁed applicants each

car.

“We also need to reach out to
some students much earlier. maybe
even in high school." said
NASFAA's Martin, “to encourage
students in certain majors that there
will be funding available for them."

Aid proponents are relying heavi-
ly on the help of Rep. Paul Simon
(D.-lll.). chairman of the House
Postsccondary Education Subcom-
mittee, to push for changes and im-
proved funding of financial aid pro-
grams.

in a blueprint for the Higher
Education Reauthorization Act.
Simon last week proposed making
Pcll Grants into an entitlement pro-
gram. raising the current Pell Grant
limit from $1,900 to 53.000. and
combining the Supplemental
Educational Opportunity Grant
(SE00). State Strident incentive
Grant (5810). and National Direct

RRESS‘, 1 

Student Loan (N DSL) pr0grams Illa:
to one campus-based block grant
program which would give colleges
greater freedom to dispense aid has-
ed on the needs of their students.

Simon would also raise College
Work-Study funding from its cur-
rent 3555 million to over $800
million by 1990. allow students
greater flexibility in consolidating
their student loans and start (a
special program to give aid to high-
school students who plan to become
teachers.

in the midst of their zeal to get
the most for financial aid programs
this _ycar. however. ﬁnancial aid
proponents "need to be concerned
about the $200 billion budget
deficits. and realize that sooner or
later there will be more
restrictions." the College Board's
Hansen noted.

“Any large programs ——- and stu- .

dent aid is a very large program now
— will face more cuts in the future:
not so much this year. since it is an
election ycar. but later on." she
warned.

"i think a lot of people will be
prone to say (improving financial
aid programs) will require a large
infusion of money, and ask ‘Can
this country afford it'i'” said Mar-
tin. “And i say they should be ask«
ing. 'C‘dll we afford not to?"‘ Cl

Enrollment up at private colleges

troll/.01; I'Rtixs SIRIItII The great
migration of private college
students to less-expensive public
schools apparently is not happen-
ing. according to a new study of
some 1200 private colleges by the
National Associatiton of Indepen-
dcttl Colleges and Universities
(NAICU).

After losing about 20.000
students last full. full-tintc
freshman enrollment at private col<
lcgcs nutionwidc rose by 1.17 per-
cent. said NAlCU‘s Julianne
Thrift.

“The picture in trcncrul is quite
uncertain." explained NAlCU Ex-
ecutive Director John Phillips. bttt
“the overall trend is al'lcast more
stable than last year. with :1 general-
ly positive tilt to thc data."

Last year's decline was tltc first
for private schools since NAlCU

began keeping track in I977. 11 was

tltc first rottnd of federal Student
ttid cuts tirade in 1981 would begin
driving students to less—expensive
public campuses by 1983.

The cuts “will most likely cause a
shift in enrollment patterns from
more expensive private schools to
public colleges," Dallas Martin of
the National Asmcintion ofStudenl
Financial Aid Administrators
predicted itt August. 1981.

'l‘hcsc shifts appeared to bc oc-
curng last fall.

Thrift now attributes last year‘s
cttrolltncnl decline to uncertainties
about the long-term prospects for
federal student aid. to the poor
cconomic climate. and to a small
demographic decline in the number
of lii-ycar-olds in the population.
but in light of this year‘s growth in
the nttmbcr of freshmen at private

colleges. Phillips says. “i think}

we've passed throttgh the worst of
the political downdraft."

Congress kept illtl funding intact
for 1981. and cvcn increased it this
year in some arc-as.

Regionally, the South's private
schools‘ freshman class increased
by 4.01 percent. Frusltttttttt class

Early adolescence testing
can predict later behavior

1(7)!l.l:til:‘I’Rlz'SSxIIRl'lt'Iz't Behavior tests
administered in early adolescence
can predict later success in college
just as well as more commonly used
scholastic aptitude tests. according
to a Cleveland State University
researcher.

Youngsters who scored high in
self control and conscientiousncss
in early adolescence behavior tests
consistently are successful when
they later cntcr college. said Dr.
James Schucrger. a SCU
psychology professor.

in 1968. Schuergcr gave
psychological and personality tests
to over 3000 males aged 14 to 19.
and recently contacted the parents
of200 of the youngsters to check on
their current scholastic pursuits.

Children who had scored higlt in
self control and "attention to
detail" httd thc highest scholastic
success. while those who showed
early signs of guilt and low self con-
trol were the least successful
academically. Schucrgcr reported.

The guilt-prone and low self con-
trol students also tended to be drug
and alcohol abusers as well. he add-
ed.

“We found that the scores on the
personality and psychological tests
.verc as good predictors of
scholastic ability as the SAT
(Scholastic Aptitttdc Test) or ACT
(American College Testing exam."

But he doesn't recommend using
pcrsonality tests to replace such
widely-used admissions tests as the
ACT and SAT.

“Personality tests would be too
easy to fake once students caught
on to them." he noted.

' The profile of a highly successful
college student. he said. would be
someone who showed “conscien-
tiottsucss, ability to turn ltt work on
time. ability to focus attention on
specific tasks. high levels of im-
agination. and introspective
abilities." lit
