it was the old story of "you win
some. you lose some" Saturday as
the host Albany State women's
gymnastics team defeated Bryn

the most was the uneven parallel
bars. Joanne MattheWs captured
this event with a strong 8.5. follow-
ed _by Armstrong‘s 8.2 and
Carolyne Friedman of Bryn Mawr’s

Mawr College. but at the same time
was narrowly defeated by
Brockport State in a three-way meet
at University Gym. The final tullles
read Brockport l5l.65. Albany
150.4. and Bryn Mawr l29.l. The
loss was Albany's closest lOSs to
Broekport in four years. but after
witnessing the display of perfection
executed by all-around champion
Ellen Selsmeyer from Broekport. it
wasn't too tough to figure out who
the deciding figure in tile contest
was.

Brockporl‘s veteran registered a
32.l5. which handily stlt‘paswtl
Brenda Armstrong of Albany with
a 30.65. and Carlene Feraco ol'
Brockport with a 30.50.

The vault was where Selstueyct
began her domination of the day's
events. Her score of 8.45 topped her

 

 

closest competitors, teammates
Feraeo and Joanne Matthews.
Brockport. who took the top three
spots. ended tip with a 39.95 and
the Great Danes scored a 39.20.

8.l. After this event. the score read
,Broekport State 77.7. Albany State
75.8.

On the balance beam it was
Selsmeyer to therescue again. She
grabbed first place with a 7.8. but
Albany’s gymnasts also put on a
fine performance. Second place
ended up a tie between Armstrong
and Jennifer Cleary. while Albany's
tri-captaln Elicia Steinberg ﬁnished
third. “ v
Selsmeyer had only one event left
to prove how dominating she was.
and that she did. She scored an
event-high 8.7 in the floor exercise.
Teammate Feraco was right behind
her with an 8.45. followed by
g Albany's Virginia Luekmau with an

.4.

The lossa was tough pill to
swallow httt the Danes had nothing
to mope over. They put on good
performance. but it just wasu‘_t
good enough.

The NCAA bulletin came out on

t Friday showing Albany ranked

ninth in the northeast for Division

‘ II and Division lll schools. Their

record now stands at 3—2 as they

' prepare to take their act on the road

Tuesday against the University of
Vermont, followed Saturday with a
tri-meet against host M.I.T. and
Howard University. i l
