ictory over riv

By Dean Chan

calms/AL AssrsraN

After three straignt easy vic-
tories. it appeared that the Albany
State men's junior varislty basket-
ball team wasincapable of turning
in a great performance. The Danes
would. play well.enough to beat
lousy teams, but what if the com-
petition was actually competitive?
Friday night’s 66-54 win over Union
answered that question.

The I2-point margin was not in-
dicative of -thc see-saw battle that
took place; in the ﬁrst four minutes
of the second half, the lead ex-
changed hands with each basket.
The contest wasn’t decided until the
last two minutes when Curtis Oliver
canned four consecutive foul shots
to put the game out 'of reach.

The Danes were having a tough
time against_ Union's zone
throughout the game. Albany was
unable to get the ball inside to either
Oliver or Rich Chapman, both in—
tegral parts of the Danes'ofl'cnse. If
it weren't for the hot shooting of
Duane Corley, the victory might
have never been. Normally, Corley
spearheads the offense with his ac-
curate passing. But with shooting
guard Andy O'Connell having an
off night, Corley had to take it
upon himself to score. After mak-
ing the initial pass, Corley would
run to the weak side of Union's
zone and often get the open shot.
“They didn't pick me up after I
passed the ball." said Corley. “i
just kept moving until I was open
for the shot."

In the second half, it seemed that
neither team would be able to gain a
clear-cut advantage. After three
consecutive Albany baskets made
the score 53-48. Head Coach Jim
Boland decided to play a little
slowdown. This move surprised the
fans at University Gym, since the
clock showed seven minutes to play.

SPORTS BRIEFS

Women ’5 track

The Albany State women’s in-
door track team may have faced
their toughest competition of the
year Sunday when they went up
against
Cortland and Division I host Ver-

. mont. UVM was ﬁrst with 84
points, Cortland was second with
52 points, and Albany was a distant

Division lli powerhouse

“We weren't playing a delay
game,” said Boland. “i was waiting
for a lay-up." . ' .

' With Chapman sitting hurt on
the bench and O'Connell being pro-
tected with four bull, delaying
might have been to sensible thing
to do. “Without those two, i didn’t
want to attack their zone,“ said
Boland. “i 'wanted Union to. come
out and play man-to-man against
us. There’s not one guy on that
team that can stay with Curtis, and
Scott (Neuman) is also pretty good
in those situations."

When a team plays a delay game,
several things can happen. The of-
fensive team can get a basket going‘
back-door; the defensive team can
steal the ball and score, or the
defense is forced to foul. This game
had a bitof everything. 30 seconds
into Albany's delay. Union picked
off a Freeze Storey pass and con-
verted the steal into two points.
Time out, Albany. Union had
three fouls to give before the Danes
would be in the bonus situation.
With Albany’s lead down to three,
53-50, it was apparent that the Dut-
chmen would gamble and try for
the turnover. Four minutes later,
the score was the same and Union
no longer had any fouls to give.

Time for Oliver to take control.

Oliver has been extremely but of
recent, scoring 26 points against
RPI last week. Against Union,
Oliver‘s play was more
workmanlikc. Taking the ball at the
line, Oliver drove straight to the
hoop for two. The next time down
the court, Oliver was fouled going
up for a shot. The free throws went
in with nary a'whimpcr. “I saw the
opening inside," said Oliver.
“When I thought i had the shot, I
‘went for it." That gave the Danes a
five point lead that they wouldn't
relinquish. '

The next sequence clinched the
victory. Union failed to score and

at Union, 66-54

Corley ended up with the ball. As
he brought the ball upcourt, he trip-
p‘ed over the Union defender. With
a lO-second violation ' and/or a
travelling violation just waiting to
be called, Corley looked desperately

‘for a teammate to pass to. Guess

who came running to the rescue.
“I was standing way upcourt and

I saw that nobody was helping

Duane," said Oliver. "I'm kind of

' slow, but I managed to get back for

the pass.‘ Corlcy threw an off-
balancc lob_pass at Oliver's direc-
tion. The Danes were lucky that
Oliver got fouled; it appeared that
Union was on their way to a
breakaway basket. Oliver sank both
foul shots to make the score 59-52.

The Danes performed well at
critical times of the game,
something Coach Boland has striv-
ed for throughout the season.
Albany broke for the gate strongly,
taking a l0-i lead in the first four
minutes of the game. In the opening
minutes of the second half, the
Danes outscored Union l0-4. And
in the final two minutes, the Dut-
chmen were outscored ll—2. That's
the way to win games.

RIM SHOTS: Despite outpluying
Union in the first half, the Danes

The Albany State wrestling team closed

out its dual meet campaign this Saturday by ‘

dropping two closely fought matches, 30-15
to Coast Guard and 24-22 to Central Con-
neticut, plummetting the Danes' record to

9-7.

A 9-7 ﬁnal season record is'.usually con-
sidered respectable for a team and its coach,
but for Head Coach Joe DeMeo and the
Albany grappiers, it marks his poorest clip
since the l980‘8i season.

The triangular meet, held at Coast Guard
Academy. left a bitter taste in their collective
mouths as they prepare to compete in the
SUNYACS this Saturday at Potsdam.

“We’re all very disappointed," said 126
pound Captain Dave Averill. "We could
have won both those matches."

Both meets were decided late in the con-
test. Coast Guard clinched the contest over
the Danes in the [90 pound weight class while
Central Connecticut pulled their meet out by
scoring a pin in the heavyweight match with
only eight seconds to play.

The latter is what stung the Purple Gang
the most. Albany State was on top, 22-18
heading into the heavyweight match helped
by the big pin from 190 pound Senior Mark
Goosens.

Papo Rivera was starting for the Danes at
that spot in place of Ivan “The Terrible"
Katz, who was defeated by Rivera earlier in

But then, disaster struck. Rivera. tired and

The lead changed hands four times, but in
the end it was the Albany State men's indoor
track team that emerged victorious from an
emotional struggle with the Engineers of
RPI. After trailing by as much as 13 points
earlier in this meeting of arch-rivals, the
Danes iced the win by taking first and second
in the triple jump and the 3,000—meter run, as
well as winning the 4x400-meter relay, the
last event. The final score was Albany, 77,
RPI, 58. The Danes have never lost in the an-
nual dual-meet and now lead the series 6-0.

Like the Marines, this year’s Aib'any squad
is made up of “a few good men." This thin-
ness was particularly evident in the ﬁeld
events where a small group of athletes gave it
their best shot and came up with some big
points. Junior Marc Mercurio led the attack

by annihilating his RPI competition in the
35-lb. weight throw where his winning toss of
51'8" was more than five feet better than the
second-place mark. As good as he is, Mer-
curio is only one person and RPI picked up
second and third. The junior did come back
to throw 38’3.75" in the shot put, an event he
doesn’t normally compete in so that he can
concentrate on his specialty, the weight-
throw. “1 offered to throw the shot because
this meet means a lot to the team,” remarked
Mercurio.

Mercurio got some help from junior
transfer Matt Hayes who won the shotput
with a respectable throw of 4i'9.75”. This
excellent debut performance allowed the
Danes to outscore the Engineers in an event
where Albany scored no points in earlier
meets.

It was another heart-breaking loss for
the .Albany State women's basketb'all‘.
team this past Saturday night. The
women cagers dropped a 72-70 decision
to the Plattsburgh Cardinals as they
finished out their conference schedule
with a 1-3 record. The Danes are ll-7
overall.

In the previous two games (losses to
St.Michaels and Binghamton) poor foul
shooting had plagued the Danes. And sure
enough, the free-throw line proved costly
once again. Albany got only 33 percent
(6-18) of their free-throws while the Car-
dinals hit for 62 percent (24-39).

Coming into the game, Albany knew
they had to contain Plattsburgh’s two big
gurs, Anne Slattery and Maureen McLen-
don. With Albany Head Coach Mari
Warner utilizing a triangle and two
defense, the Danes hcld McLendon
Scoreless for the entire game. Slattery,
though, was another story. She pumped in
29 points and led the Cardinals to the two-
point victory.

“Once we figured Slattery was going to
score, we concentrated on holding the rest
0f the team,“ said Warner. “We were
Changing defenses throughout the game."

A major factor in the game was the foul
situation. The Danes committed 34 fouls

difference," commented Warner. "It
wasn’t a well-officiated game, but that's
no excuse for how we played." Diane Fer-
nandcs, Jean Pollock, and Rainny Lcsanc
all fouled out for Albany.

Plattsburgh led 33-28 at the half with
Slattery leading the way. “We were very
sluggish and we weren‘t running out
there," stated Warner.

With 45 seconds to play, the Danes
trailed 69-66. They had to foul and hope
the Cardinals missed the front end of a
couple of onc-and-oncs. But that wasn't
the case. Plattsburgh converted their free-
throws and never gave Albany a chance to
win the game.

From the field, the Danes hit 32 shots
compared to the Cardinal's 24. Usually,
that much of a margin is enough to win a
game. But in the end, the bottom-line is
which team can make their free-throws.
Plattsburgh did, Albany did not.

“The team played mttch better in the sc-
cond half," assessed Warner. “If we can
only come out playing the first half like
the second halfI we'd be o.k."

Lesane led the Danes in scoring with M
points. Eighteen of those came in the sc-
cond half. Ronnie Patterson scored all of
her l2 points in the second half. If the
Danes can put togehter 40 consistent
minutes and start hitting some free-throw,
they can still be a force in the SUNYAC

 

to the Cardinal's 19. "That's too big of a Conferencc.

‘viance and junior Bill Waring went one-two
in the long jump early in the meet with both
jumpers clearing the 20-foot mark. Later on,
Mancc popped a jump of 4l'l l" to win the
triple jump, as many expected him to.
However, Waring, a newcomer to the triple
jump, was in fourth place before his last
jump. Said Head Coach Bob Munsey, “We
needed Bill to pick up a third, but he outdid
himself.” On his final try, Waring jumped
4l'0" besting his old mark by more than four
feet.

The Danes got a bad start in the running
events when the Albany 4x800-metcr relay
team of Tim Hoff, Captain Ed McGili,
sophomore Ian Clements. and junior Jim Er-
win were beaten by a strong RPI squad.
Albany began scoring points again in the
lSOO-meter run where junior Tom Kacandes
and sophomore Craig Parlato took second
and third respectively behind RPI superstar
Scott LeMay. Albany was represented in the
45-metcr high hurdles by undefeated

sophomore Bruce Van Tassel who placed
first with a time of 7.2 seconds.

The Danes were able to to take the lead
when John Reilly and Andy Callari placed
first and second respectively in the 400-metcr
run.

was his best ever. Albany continued to rack
up points behind Pat Saccocio's ﬁrst place
effort in the SOO-metcr dash. His time of
i:08.6 qualiﬁes him for the state champion-
ships. Freshman Jim McDonagh ran a per-
sonal best time of l:l0.2 to place third.
Sophomore Bucc Van Tassel captured his se-
cond event of the day with a time of 5.7
seconds in the 45-metcr dash while Saccocio
placed third in the time of 5.8 seconds.

RPI managed to come back and tie it up
during the 800 and 1000«meter runs. After
going the distance in second place. junior Jim
Erwin was nipped at the line in the 800-meter
and ﬁnished third with a respectable time of

again lost ground as Kacandes and Parlato
took second and third again. Their respective
times were 2:383 and 2541.5.

From there on in, it was all Albany. McGill
led the Dane attack in the 3000-mctcr run
with his ﬁrst place time of 8:59, while
Clements placed second with a fine time of
9:05. It was during this race that the good
news came in from the triple jump pit. The
