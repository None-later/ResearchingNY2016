through. “leased telephone lines
costing 316.000 a year and may in-
crease by l00 percent because of
telephone divestiture." Galletly ex-
plained. ’ '

He said that the acquisition of a
building to enable WAMC to
operate under one roof was an im-
portant objective in WAMC's
“Save Our Station" campaign in-
itiated in 1980. When Albany
Medical College stopped supporting
the station in l980, WAMC turned
,to the community for help in resolv-
ing the financial difficulties it faced,
said Galletly.

WAMC broadcastcd a “Save
Our Station" (8.0.5.) five-day on-
air marathon in early 1981 to avoid
going off tlte air. The sttpport
fottnd in the community has
guaranteed a financial base for
WAMC. atttl a listcttcrship devoted
to the public radio station's diverse
programming. The station is

chartered as an educational cor-
poration by the New York State
Board of Regents." Chartock
stated. “with an independent board
of directors."

WAMC is a contributor to public
affairs programming and uses their
news studios in ECC to produce
local news shows such as “Midday
Magazine." “Northeast Dateline."
and “Legislative Gazette." Char-
tock. Fred Dicker from the New
York Post and another reporter
host the Weekly “Capitol Connec~

which features the governor of New
York answering questions frotn the

WAMC also has access to pro-
gratntning from National Public
Radio, American Public Radio Net-
work. the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation. the Eastern Public
Network and tile British Broad-
casting Corporation. 1' i

afraid of parties and noise. This is
doc to the poor connotations that
I'rats received from the movie
"Animal House." “We're not like
‘Animal House.‘ " Weinl‘cld said.

Hansen and Ellncr both feel that
people have developed the wrong
impression of Delta Sigma Pi.
“One goal that we are trying to ac-
complish this sclttcslcr is to change
the image. Delta Sigma Pi has been
called ‘elitist.' " said Hansen. She
went on to explain that people think

‘ that the frat members are out to get
the best grades and that they are
very contpetitivc. “Too many peo-
ple tltink that." she said. "We're
fun people too."

According to 'Ellner. “Pi SiBmﬂ

Epsilon has a newer image."
Both presidents cttiphnsirctl that

‘ they are looking for pcole who will

help themselves as well as the frater-
nity as a whole.

Ellner added that although Delta
Sigma Pi is oriented towards “the
hard core professional... it is more
than professionalism. Thc people
(in the frat) all have a common
bond or goal and even aside frotu
the build there is social interaction
between others."

Both frats have already started
the spring rush for new pledges. and
both presidents have high expecta-
tions for the new semester. Several
activities have been planned, some
of which include guest speakers.
fund raisers and business related
presentations. D

Hazardous waste sites

“These are a lack of funds. a lack
of active participation by the
Department of Health and a failure
of both the DOH and DEC to com—
plete the preliminary site evalua-
tions as required before remedia-
tion can begin." DeVito added.

The EPL also supported an in—
crease in the funds allocated for
remediation of sites. “This requires
a serious financial commitment,”
stated DeVito. adding “There ntust
be at least a commitment of $50
million per year."

Department of Energy press
representative John F. Moore tn-
dicntcd how the superfund money
from last year was allocated." The
majority of the money, approx-
imately 50 percent. was spent to
tear up for the program attd litre
“Witional staff to itnplentent the

“The sites in this area are In

Bonsel indicatetl that his region
had yet to receive any superfund
tnonics for remediation. "The
superfund monies are only
allocated if a responsible party who
dumped hazardous wastes at the
site cannot be located. Before we
receive any superfund monies. we
generally'litigate with tltc responsi-
ble parties in order to force thctn to
