A new SUNYA PhD. program
in Social Welfare has sent applica-
tions to almost 200 students who
have expressed interest. according
to the chair of the program Pro~
fessor Aaron Rosenblatt.

“This is a tailor-made program.“
said Rosenblatt.addlng that the
students will be able to study “the
social problems or clinical interven-
tion they are most interested In."

dUe to administration cutbacks

Washington. D. C.
u-orrs'or: muss .‘ih'lll'lf'lilElﬂﬂllCiﬂi aid
for college students ltas plummeted
2! percent-- over $2 billion-- since
the Reagan administration took of-
fice in I980. according to a just-
releascd study by the College
Board.

From a high of $18 billion in
l98l-82. the amount of ﬁnancial
aid available for students has drop-
ped to a low of just over $I6 billion
for the current academic year.

"And that 32 billion decline is
even greater when inflation is taken
into account.“ noted College Board
spokeswoman Janice Cams. “Aid
had been cut by one-fifth in
inflation-adjusted terms."

Much of the decline is due to cuts
the Reagan administration and
Congress have made in Social
Security benefits for college
students. stricter limits on
Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL)
eligibility. and a porn-Vietnam drop
in the use of veterans‘ benefits.

In addition. the study reports “a
switch in the trend from grants to
loans which has been remarkable."
Cams said.

In I970-7I. for. instance. grants
accounted for nearly two-thirds of

all financial aid. while loans and
work-study benefits accounted for
the other third.

- By I975~76. grants constituted
over 80 percent of all financial atd
expenditures. loans [7 percent. and
College Work~Studyrthree percent.

For the current year. ltowcvcr.
loans and grants each account for
48 percent of student aid, and Col-
lege Work-Study the remaining
four percent.

At a time when college financial
aid experts are‘growing increasingly
concerned about the level of long-
term debt college students are incur-
ring.‘ the decline in the amount of
available grant money promises to
have far-reaching implications.

At the same time. “the early
I9805 have seen a major change in
the relationship of costs. income
and aid for college," the report
said. “Adjusted for inflation. costs
ltave increased. but income and
financial aid per full-time
equivalent student have not."

"Thus." the study concluded.
“in contrast to what can be said
generally about the past two
decades (when income and ﬁnancial
aid‘awards actually stayed ahead of
college costs). college has become

relatively more difficult for families

to afford in the l9805."

But the results of “Trends itt Stu-
dent Aid: $634983" should also
“be put in the context of how much
financial aid has really grown over
the past years." Gams suggests.

The federal role in financial aid
has indeed swelled in the last two
decades. from 40 percent to 80 per-
cent of all aid assistance.

Financial aid from all sources--
federal. state and institutions-- has
skyrocketed from only $546 million
in I963-64 to $4.5 billion in l970-7l
to a high of $18 billion in l981-82.
the study says.

Except for the last titree years.
student aid increased five times
faster than college spending in the
last 20 years.

Tuition and room and board at
private schools has increased from
$2105 to $8537 in the last two
decades. while the cost of attending
a public school rose from $l026 to
$3403 over the same period. the
study says. I .I

‘ The reason is that measles is mak-

people. In I98]. there were I01 stu-
dent measles cases around the coun-

then ballooned to some 282 student

the problem could spread farther

“Measles.” points out Dr.
Harley Feldriek of lowa's student
health service. “is probably the
most contagious of contttturticablc

last spring ’5 measles epidemic spread across six college

students and urging them to get im-
munized. In mid-epidemic last spr-
ing Indiana kept non-immune
students from returning from spr.

Some groups — Inostvnotablc the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
and the American College Health
Association (ACHA) —- now want
all schools to force students to pro-
ve they're immune before even be-
ing admitted to college. The CDC's

'l‘hirtyuthrce of the cases were at

halt" in Bloontington. said Dr.
MarJeaItnc Collins. Collins heads
ACHA‘s immunization program
and is a director of the University of
Pennsylvania's Student Health
Center. Last spring‘s cpidentic

Midwest. Texas. and Florida, ac-
cording to the CDC in Atlanta.

before tltc person actually l'cels

ly a less debilitating fornt of
measles. but it catt cause birth
defects in unborn children, lte add-
cd.

As many as one ottt of every five
college students in tltc US. may be
susceptible to tltc disease. Collins

estimates. because people in the
l7-to-25 year old age bracket receiv-
ed a "killed’lvaccine when they
were in grade school in the I9605.
The “killed” vaccine gives people a
temporary immunity to measles.
"Live" measles vaccine, on the
other ltand. provides people with
life-long immunity. Collins said.

Those numbers translate into
huge swarms of susceptible students
on individual campuses. Purdue has
lmltltltlltctl 7.00010 8.000 students.
says Patricia Boardntart. wlto was
Purdue's state health representative
dttrittg last spring’s epidetttic. ln-
diana has gotten to sotttc 2.1.000'
students since the epidemic. wltile
Illinois immunized about 4.000.
ltcaltlt officials on those campuses
say. l-Iouston has managed to rcttch
30.000 students sittcc the spring. ac-
cording to .lcartic llopp of Ull's
Health Center.

In preparatiott for this month‘s
new registration requirement. Iowa
began a campus-wide immunization
program irt November that even-
tually attracted [2.000 students.
lowa's Fcldrick says the immuniza-
tiort program cost the university
itself $7.500. But the state Health
Department and the Centers for
Disease Cotttrol picked up the tab
for the vaccine and the extra people

hired to administer the shots. The
full costs can be prohibitive. In-
diana's statewide vaccination pro-
gram last spring cost over $500.“.
Boardman says. “It's hard to move
in to immunizc everybody." Collins
concedes. “The cost in that kind of
thing is very high.“ .

A program like Iowa‘s. noted Dr.
C. Bricfer of the University of
Michigan‘s health center. is
"logistically very hard to do."

"We haven‘t seen the justifica-
tion for the tremendous expense of
a (vaccine) program." adds Dr.
Eugene Flipsey. head of the Univer~
sity of Miami‘s Stttdent llealtlt Ser-
vices.

In some places. schools have
spent a lot of money on an im-
munization program that never at-
tracted a crowd. Florida State. for
one. set up a discount \accinc pro-
gram tltrcc years ago. but “we
Itardly had arty takers at all."
rccttlls‘FSU llealtlt Services Direc-
tor Dr. Frank Gugliano. Never-
theless. an cpidetnic “can happen at
arty time." Gagliano warns. Attd if
it does. students can face more
serious consequences than missing
classes. “Tire risk of complications
(front measles) is higher in older
(college-aged) individuals." says
the CDC's Farley. El

Student papers tone down to survive setbacks

imrtmr mass SERVICE) All that hap-
pened to the conservative Davis

'Dtmier during its first year of
newspaper life was that a homosex-
ual student politician threatened to
sup. administrators barred it from
University of Calitornia-Davis
dorms, and one of its advertisers
publically apologized for buying
space in it. Then some of the
paper's other advertisers dropped
out. And then it got into a name-
calling contest with the California

But survival itself is no mean
trick when the fatality rate for
publications is so high. when the
slttdcnt press itt particular is in a
depression. when‘ ntatty ad-
ministrators have been openly
hostile toward the papers. and when
malty of the papers themselves try
to attract attention by affecting a
cultured disdain for non“)
conservative artd certain not-very;
powerful Atttcricatt groups.

Sornc papers even are thriving.
largely because of off-campus
subscriptions artd the support of
foundations and wealthy friends
like Charlton Heston attd l’residcnt
Reagan‘s brother.

The Durt/nnw/I Review. a
pioneer of the new wave. is growing
“at an exponential rate." former
Editor Mike Collette said. Off-
campus paid circulation rose by 40
percent — or 3.000 people — iIt tltc
last year.

“Most of the papers support
themselves now." said John Car-
son. founder of Student Magazine
in Colorado and of Students for a
Better America. a conservative stu-
dent group.

Only one of the 34 papers has
failed. said Iiill .lcrtsen. grants direc-
tor of the Institute for Education
Affiars (IEA) in New York.

Tltc IEA. a conservative think
tank founded by forntcr Treasury
Secretary William Sinton and writer
Irvittg Kristol. has given ntoncy lC
most of the papers to help launch
them. This year alone. the IEA ltas
contributed some 5350.000 to 24
papers “tltat are without exception

intellectually conservative.“ Jensen
said. “The money is a seed
grant." ltc explained. “We're not
funding on going operations. In
fact. most of ottr concern with our
applicants is with determining
whether they can complete the pro—
jects they’re undertaking. if they've
made the editorial and production
fundraising plans they'll be
needing."

Sometimes they've needed other
kinds of help. The ACLU two
weeks ago began representing tltc
Hawkcye Review in its crusade to
distribute in the University of
Iowa‘s dorms. The ACLU has also

rcprcscrttcd the Dartmouth paper irt
legal scrapes.

“The question." said Dwayne
Rohovit of the Iowa ACLU. “is
freedom of the press."

Conservative papers at Nor-
thwestern and Columbia have also
had trouble distributing on their
campuses. Administrators usually
fight them because they're angry
over the papers' dclibertatcly pro-
vocative styles. though one teacher
is suing the Dartmouth pttpcr for
libel.

servative Cali/braid Review in the
wake of a Review article many
students construed “to be in favor
of rape." recalled Christopher
Canola. then a Review staffer who
now writes for the Daily Guardian
on campus. Review Editor Eric
Young dismissed the readers' anger
by claiming the woman who led the
effort to withdraw funding “was so
far into feminism and is a bona fidc
homosexual. so her credibility is
nothing."

But such scrapes have led some
editors to consider a retreat from
provocation. .

Young resolved that "we're not
here to rile people. but to generate
thought." The Dartmouth Review

is minimal — the Davis Dossier. for
exantplc. attracts three ads per
quarter — the papers risk increasing
dependence on the IEA if they
don‘t establish \vidcr support. On
the other hand. they could risk los-
ing IEA support if they moderate
their stories in the pursuit of wider
support.

“If arty of (the lEA’s) papers
changed their editorial policy (away
front support for defense spending
and free market economics). the
IEA would probably drop its sup-
port of the paper." Carson
speculated.

The IEA's Jensen. however. said
the IEA allows "a great range" of
opinion in the papers it supports.'l I
