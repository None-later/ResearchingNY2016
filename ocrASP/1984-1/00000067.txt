Rally for Jackson

Temple said that. in her district.
Jackson was “running stronger
than the Other candidates."

After she spoke to the assembled
ralliers. Temple estimated that
Jackson was “probably number
two or higher" in her district. and
said that the petitions were a very
strong indication. She added that

she could not estimate Jackson’s
position on a national level.
Vazquez said to the group-that

Jackson is “an advocate for human

rights. We don't have human rights
in I984." Jackson "is trying to do
what no president has emphasized:
fight for all people." she continued.

Jackson gives “new hope to
black youth of America." said Vaz-
quez. She added that it was “impor-
tant for a black man to run for
president” because “anyone may
have hope of becoming a leader
some day in this country."

Rainbow Coalition tnembcr
Michael Stevens proposed “two

critical questions: Why Jesse? and
why now?" He mentioned that
some people said that Jackson
would “fraction the Democratic
Party" by running.

Stevens said that he thinks
Jackson can win. and that “I know
he must win in order to prove
America is the America they‘ve
always said it was." Jackson tnust
win to prove freedom and equality

‘ exist in the U.S.. Stevens asserted.

“The next president will
solidify" the U.S. position on
crime. the courts, the budget

deficit. and the arms race “for the
next 20 years." stressed Stevens.
"We are carrying our future in this
campaign." he declared.

Stevens. who is running as a
delegate for Jackson. claimed that
“Jackson is running a personal
campaign. a people campaign.” He
said that if Jackson bccomcs presi-
dent. he will “save the world from
itself."

Campaign Buttons Debated

A bill prohibiting the “wearing
of Student Association election
campaign buttons and other cam-
paign paraphenalia at Central
Council metings" was passed l4 - 5-
0. immediately after its passage
Schaffer promised to veto- it. The
bill may come up at the next
meeting for a vote to override the
veto.

The vote was preceded by a long
debate. lasting nearly an hour.-The
discussion centered on whether the
bill would improve Council's image
or whether it would infringe on the
representatives’ freedom of expres-
sion.

Off-campus representative Dave
Silk supported the measure. “But-
tons simply detract from debate and
the appearance of the unity of SA.
Perhaps a bit of formality would
end some of the petty things that go
on in here." he said.

Council chair Bob Helbock
disagreed. “it's ridiculous." he
claimed. The bill. he said. was “get-
ting into nit-picking things.” He
stressed Council's political nature,
and praised campaign buttons for
“bringing politics to the Council
ﬂoor." in response to the impor-
tance of formality. Helbock said.

Dormirooms burglariaed over break

‘We're still amateurs. these are not
the hallowed halls of the
Legislature.“

Alumni Quad representative
Steve Russo mentioned a scenario
where buttons could harm SA
politics and the passage of legisla-
tion. He said that an interest group
could contact a Council represen-
tative and ask him to Support a cer-

.tain policy. If the representative

was wearing a button which an-
nounced who he supported in the
SA presidential race. and he said he

‘ would not support the group's posi-

tion. that group might support an
opposing presidential candidate, he
said. This could pose a conflict of
interest. with the . representative
torn between his stand on a policy
and his support for a candidate. ex-
plained Russo.

Schaffer announced that an in-
vestigation is being launched to
determine why the administration
did not give SA its activity fee funds
sooner.

Jeff Weinstein of Dutch Quad
resigned from Council. According
to Helbock. his reason for resigning
was that "SA circled around a cli-

The words leave a large loophole

Zimmerman. ,

It is only speculation as to the

but an examination of the other 17

effectiveness.

The greatest ERA affect has been

only the husband paid alimony. ac-
cording to Zimmerman.

Aiding this change was a i979
Supreme Court decision’ that pro-
hibits alimony payments only to
women. said Zimmerman. As a
result of the decision. the term
‘alimony' was thrown out in favor
of ‘support' or ‘maintenance'. ac-
cording to Zimmerman.

But. even though ‘sex-neutral
criteria’ has been instituted in these
ERA states. "the courts still tend to
favor and give preference to the
mother; few men are awarded.”
said Zimmerman.

in cases of employment
discrimination. Zimmerman noted
that. the state of Utah ruled that in
matters of pregnancy there exist
substantial differences between the
sexes and their roles in the work
place. Even some supporters of the
ERA will agree with this." said
Zimmerman.

in athletics, where girls want to -

try out for a boys‘ team when ,no
girls' team exists, “the courts in
ERA states have generally ruled in
favor of the girls." said Zimmer-
man. .

The last New York State ERA
was defeated in 1975. victorious on-
ly in New York City. The state

amendment resembles the federal
amendment that was defeated
following its failure to win the re-
quired approval of two-thirds of the
nation‘s state legislatures.

Because of an election year the
state ERA will have to go through
both houses twice and then be plac-
ed as a referendum before the
voters. The earliest that the referen-
dum could reach the voters would
be l985.

“Possible saving grace (for
ERA's) is the fact that the state

‘ legislature can step in." said Zim-

merman. An example surfaced in
the state of Maryland. he added.
They adopted an ERA but the
courts continued to use maternal
preference in divorce cases under
the “Tender Years" doctrine. he
explained. The legislature interven-
_ed and the “Tender Years” doc-
trine was eliminated. said Zimmer-
man.

Asked what he forsees for the
proposed ERA and its passage.
Zimmerman said that because it's
an election year legislators may be
wary about it. He added that you
also have to keep in mind that the
third largest party in the state is the
Right to Life Party who would like
to see a separate amendment added
to prohibit abortion. i’l

Binghamton telephones

<Front Page

SUNYA running its own telephone
system. Student Association Presi-
dent Rieh Schaffer replied. “They
can‘t run a bus system. i don‘t see
how they can run a telephone ser-
vice.” However, Schaffer added
that his stance could change if a
regulatory council which encom-
passed the dorms. similar to the
University Auxiliary Services
Beard. was included in the process.

Presently in Binghamton. Leffler
is supporting a resolution that
would lead to the creation'of a
“Campus Telephone Regulatory
Council." The council would be
made up of eight members; four
students. three administrators and
one faculty member.

Currently. chfler noted. the
Binghamton Cam‘us Telephone

System is not under the auspices of
tile Federal Public Service Commis-
sion. This. according to chflcr.
means that the University can set its
own rates for phone service accor-
ding to the costs it incurs.

The Federal Public Safety Com-
mission is looking at the Bingham-
ton systctn. but. according to a
spokesman. the commission hasn’t
made a ruling yet on witethcr or not
to include the Blnghamtion phone
system under its control. The Public
Safety Commission regulates rates
of all utilities. ‘

Leffler urged student participa-
tion in the process of selecting a
new telephone system for the
Albany campus. if students don’t
take an active role, she said. they
risk a plight similar to that of
Blnghamton. l3
