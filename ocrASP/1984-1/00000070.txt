businesses has been set up to finance an ar-
my to fight uniﬁcation with the Irish
Republic.

Andy Tyrie, commander of the Ulster.

Protestant-dominated British province. He

predominantly Roman Catholic Irish
Republican Army and its splinter groups

Northern Ireland with the overwhelmingly
Catholic Irish Republic.

raising operations used by the IRA.

(AP) The three and a half year-old War bet-
ween Iran and Iraq has taken a new twist.
with the two countries intensifying shelling
of civilian areas but providing advance war-
ning so residents‘of the target zones can
ﬂee.

Iran shelled seven Iraqi cities and towns
on Sunday. and Iraq retaliated by ﬁring on
four iranian cities. Iraqi officials said the
Iranians killed 14 people and injured 89.
and Iran claimed the Iraqis killed at least 15
people and wounded more than 120.

Both sides forewarned each other of the
attacks in an effort to allow civilians to
evacuate targeted areas, and Iran’s prime
minister, Mir Hosscin Musavi, said the
policy “should be accepted by world public
opinion."

Collaborators freed
Paris
(AP) Three Frenchmen who collaborated
with the Nazis during the German occupa-
tion of France in World War II have been
freed from prison after serving 20-year
terms. Justice Ministry sources say.

Two of the men < Jean Barbier, 64. and
Jacques Vasseur. 63 - had been sentenced to
death after being convicted of killing. tor-
turing, and deporting French resistance
fighters during the Vichy collaboration
government.

The third man, Albert Cortial. 64, was
released in late 1982, the sources said Sun-
day. Cortial. originally sentenced to life,
was charged with handing over resistance
ﬁghters to Nazi ofﬁcials.

The Barbier and Vasseur dcath sentences
were commuted to life prison terms in 1966,
and in I970 the late President Georges

Fighting subsides

’ Beiml
(AP) The street fighting and artillery bur-
rages around Beirut subsided Monday
following statements by government leaders
that they would step up efforts to give
Lebanon's Moslem majority greater power.

President Amin Gemayel rejected
demands by opposition leaders that he
resign and said he hopedto convene a na--
tional reconciliation conference with
leaders of Lebanon's rival factions in
Geneva, Switzerland. within two weeks.

Gemayel, during an impromptu briefing
of reporters Sunday, also said he expects
the multinational force to remain in
Lebanon. He said the plan to withdraw
U.S. Marines to ships offshore was just a
"detail." ' i

“I am conﬁdent that President Reagan is
fully- committed to help Lebanon,” he said.

It was Gemayel's ﬁrst public statement
since rebels seized control of west Beirut,
the Moslem half of the capital, in battles
with the Lebanese army a week ago.

Prison break foiled

.Breniwooti
(AP) Three inmates attempting to break out
of a state prison facility were caught Mon-
day whena makeshift rope hanging from a
seventh-floor window broke and one of the
men was injured, authorities said.

The daring pre-dawn escape attempt oc-
curred at the Long Island Correctional
Facility - the same prison where two in-
mates were stabbed to death in fights over
the weekend.

Lou Ganim, a spokesman for the State
Department of Correction, said the three
men. whose names were not disclosed. used
part of a bed frame to pry open the hinges
of a window in their holding cell. Thcrt they
fashioned a rope from knotted bedsltccls
and blankets. tied it to a radiator and
climbed from the seventh-floor window, he
said.

Ganim said a guard discovered the at-
tempted brcakoul when he found one of the
men lying on the ground below the window
at 5 a.m., after the makeshift rope had ap-
parently snapped some 40 or 50 feet frotu
the ground.

Officials dispute need for.
Guardian Angels in Albany

By Christine Reffelt
STAFF warm:

‘ The Guardian Angels are explor-
ing the possibility of forming a
chapter in Albany, but at least one
neighborhood official says the
group is unneeded and unwelcome.

Establishing a chapter of the
Gttardian Angels in Albany will
“cast a terrible stigma on the com-
munity." according to Nebraska
Brace, an Alderman from the Ar-
bor Hill district of Albany, an area
that the Guardian Angels would
patrol.

Brace said he feels that a Guar-
dian Angel chapter in downtown
Albany wouldn't solve any pro-
blems that the Albany Police
department cannot handle.

“It is the duty of the police
department to protect the com-
munity, not the (duty of the) Guar-
dian Angels," asserted Brace.
“Community participation and in-
volvement with the police force" is
what is needed to make crime en-
forcement more effective, he stress-
e .
Guardian Angels leader Curtis
Sliwa contended that Brace is “un-
willing to debate the merits of the
Guardian Angels. Instead. he has
chosen to go to battle with us.”

Guardian Angels Volunteer Fran
White added, “authorities just get
nervous because they do not know
the facts,“ she explained. “and
what you don‘t know. you fear."

On Thursday, February 16, and
Friday, February 17. Sliwa and a
few members of the Guardian
Angels from Buffalo and Montreal
will meet outside City Hall in
Albany to hand out 600 surveys,
said Sliwa. The scientific. analytical
survey will help the Guardian
Angels to “broaden our diagnosis
of the community needs for a
chapter in the area," Sliwa said.

The Guardian Angels never come
to any city uninvited. according to
White. “The community members
wrote and told us about the crime
problems, and asked us ifwe would
consider beginning a chapter in the
Arbor Hill area." she maintained.
“The community itself must supply
members. who in turn must be
legally certified in the martial arts,"
White said.

Albany, like many cities. needs
protection, White asserted.
“Albany must be a real paradise if
there aren't any critnc problems
there," site charged.

The Guardian Angels consists of
all volunteer workers. according to
White. Trained young men and
women go into communities on
patrols of eight Guardian Angels.

weapons," maintained White, their

ing him for his outstanding

Volunteer Action Award. said
White.

“The Guardian Angels have been
recognized by countless volunteer
work," White stressed.

People in general, explained
White, are under many misconcep-
tions about the Guardian Angels.
White maintained, “members are
out to help community members,
senior citizens, and serve as role
models for the very young."

When Guardian Angel members
see crimes being committed. they
enact a citizens arrest, which “any
United States citizen is entitled to
perform under the constitution,"
White said.

The criminal is surrounded by the
Angels, and one member subse-
quently gets the details while
another member goes to get the
police, elaborated White.

“Only when absolutely necessary
would violence ever be used,” con-
tended White. “The Angels are
prepared for anything, but do not
advocate violence as a means to
achieve results," she added.

Sliwa said that beginning a Guar-
dian Angels chapter is an “offense
to Nebraska‘s (Brace) ego." He ad-
ded that “Nebraska (Brace) can't
speak for the Arbor I-Iili residents
like lte claims he is doing, because
the hard-working, decent people
came and spoke to me." He stress-
ed that “the hardest thing for

didate Rev. Jesse Jackson address-
ed the National Student Conference
on Voter Registration at Harvard
University on Sunday. February 12.
Jackson. who had the standing

» room only crowd on its feet at times

during his hour long speech, ad-
dressed such topics as foreign
policy, and treatment of minorities.
as well as stressing the importance
of voter registration in the upcom-
ing election.

Jackson pointed out that today's
generation will be the first “to use
the vote to retire our adversaries
and reward our~allies." He men-
tioned that very few students in the
1960's used this privilege to vote,
and emphasized that the generation
ofthe 1980's must “shift from pro-
tests to politics."

Jackson urged all those in atten-
dance to “fight for a unified
registration code all over the na-
tion." According to Jackson,
students today face “new forms of
denial." The old forms, he stated.
were “based on age. or literacy
tests. or poll taxes." while the new
ones he cited were “inaccssible
registrars, second primaries and
dual registration."

Two of the reforms Jackson sug-
gestcd were the initiation of post-
card registration nationwidc and
deputy registrars on campus.
“Downtown ought to come to the
campus," he said, “the campus
should not have to go downtown."

According to Jackson. "inac-
cessible registrars are more the rule
than the exception.” He added that
“it ought to be as easy to register as
it is to pay taxes."

Jackson said that he feels that
every high school student who
graduates should walk out of his or
her school with a diploma in one
hand as a symbol of knowledge
“and a voter card in the other sym-
bolizing power and responsibility." ‘
Jackson also said that one of his I
plans is to have every United States
soldier be registered to vote.

Jackson encouraged student
organizations on campus, such as
fraternities and sarorities, to refuse
to admit any new members until
they were registered, as a way of

raising the number of student
voters. .

According to Jackson, the
challenge facing today's generation
is “to achieve greatness". After
relating stories about struggles that
were fought in the 1960's, such as
the sit-ins and the 1963 march on
Washington.D.C.. Jackson urged
students to remember that "you
must serve your present age."
“Your generation cannot become
great just by remembering what
that generation (1960's) did." he
said.

Jackson also urged the registra-
tion of minorities. specifically
blacks and hispanics. According to
Jackson. the Equal Rights Amend-
ment will not pass unless blacks and
hispanics “are enfranchised." “If
we are tied to each other,” he said.
“we can redirect the course of this
nation."

Jackson said he feels that the pro-
blem with President Ronald Reagan
isn't his lack ofleadership qualities.
which Jackson acknowledged, but
that “his direction threatens the
human race." According to

- policy on Central America. Jackson
remarked that “all policy begins
with an attitude." According to
Jackson, the attitude that Central
America is our back door is wrong.
“It is not a back door.‘he said. it is
our ‘next door’”. ‘

Jackson also emphasized that_

“our boys should be brought back
home and sent to college."

He also chided the president for
cutting aid to education and in-
creasing aid to El Salvador. No per-
son who “has a mind to work and a
will to learn should be turned away
due to lack of money," Jackson
said. ' I

When asked about abortion,
Jackson said he is “pro-choice, not
pro-abortion." There's a ‘dif-
ference, he said. between being pro-
choice and pro-abortion and em-
phasized that people have to
remember “it's their body and their
conscience."

Jackson said he feels the New
Hampshire primary coming up on
February 28 could be very impor-
tant to him and to his "Rainbow
Coalition", a group set up by

“Your generation cannot become
great just by remembering what

that generation

(1960’s) did. ”

—-Jesse Jackson

 

Jackson, the U.S. and the Soviet
Union have a nutlual capacity for
annihilation. ‘ What the United
States needs. be said. is " a balance
of power and respect with the
Soviet Union."

Jackson pointed to two indexes
which he considered the "misery in-
dex" and the “danger index". He
said that the misery index, under
Reagan, is on the rise and, in addi—
tion, “we must reduce the danger
index for the whole world.”

Jackson's campaign is based on
the premise that the country “needs
a new direction." According to
Jackson. a leader “must talk. and

Iwhen you talk, you act. when you

act. you change things."

Jackson then criticized Reagan's
viewpoints on several issues.
Jackson emphasized the fact that
the U.S. should not be in
Nicaragua. When questioned on his

Jackson. “The New Hampshire
primary could be the Selma to Mon-
tgomery of this period," said
Jackson. referring to Dr. Martin
Luther King's historic march in the
early l960's.

While speaking of the coalition’s
fate. Jackson said “if we come out
of New Hampshire with our coali-
tion intact, we could change the
course of this nation."

Jackson arrived in Cambridge
late Saturday night and left im-
mediately after the speech for
Chicago. He told the more than 900
students who filled Memorial Hall,
as well as the overflow. who saw the
speech on closed circuit television.

He said that he had ﬁnally sug-
gested the early hour of 8 a.m. on
the premise that if students

.wouldn‘t show up, he wouldn't

have to either. “But here you are,"
he said, adding “there must be
something going on." . CI

 

Nebraska (Brace) to understand is
that we are coming to the Albany
area because the community invited
us." '

Sliwa said he views Brace as "a
lackey for the mayor and the
Albany Police Chief." Sliwa
vehemently stated that “they can-
not slip us into their back pockets;
it won't work because we see politi-
cians almost as puppets in
machines’ trends."

The Albany Police, in a state-
ment issued yesterday, reported
that “the mayor of the city and the
chief of police do not feel the
establishment of a Guardian Angels
chapter is necessary."

Sliwa, however. said he feels that
by organizing a chapter in the
Albany area, the Guardian Angels
are "giving men and women the op-
portunity to be physically involved

Angels also have repeatedly shown,

have resulted from Guardian
Angels' work. Sliwa added.
