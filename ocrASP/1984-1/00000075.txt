being able to turn away waste from
other states." Kobrynski pointed
out. _

The second option is for New

York State to build a facility. Since
the state produces a large amount
of‘ waste. it would be possible to
form a completely new compact
with one or two states who gcncrotc
small amounts of‘ waste. Kobrynskl
nddcd. "We could also cnlcr into a
compact with another state who is
willing to bc a host."
‘ Kobrynski said the third choice is
to join NEC-However. the energy
ofﬁce is against this until amend-
ments are added to the compact.
They feel the authority of NEC is
too broad. According to Kobryn-
ski. the energy ofﬁce thinks that the
actual site and the technology used
for construction should be left to
the discretion of‘ the host state.

“There is also the problem ol‘
Kobrynski added.
"These sites must be taken care of
for a long time. After asitc is filled

. and closed who takes care of it and

pays for it?." she questioned.

A representative from the En-
vironmental Planning Lobby.
Elizabeth Lyons, said, "The (NEC)

‘ compact seems to make cithcr New

York or Pennsylvania a likely host

.‘ state. This triggers concern among

New Yorkch on the issue of
reopening West Valley."

West Valley was a reprocessing
' c owned by Getty and opened in

the early 60's. Part of the site was

 used to store high level waste from

 nuclear plants.

said Kobrynski,

while another part of the site was

guscd for low level waste.

Poor

drainage caused the storage trcn-
cites to l'ili up causing it busin of'
radioacdvc waste. ' .\

However. it was not closcd for
this reason. Kobrynskl asserted.
Wilclt Gctty was forced to rebuild
the rcporccsslng plant because of‘
new regulation. he found it un-
prof‘itablc'to keep the plant open
and closcd it on his own In I975.

The federal government has Iti-
tcmptcd to remedy the situation by
contracting Westinghouse to clean
up high level waste. said Kobrynski.
The high level waste Is being ship-
pcd back to original owners.
However. the low level waste is a
problem of New York State and still
remains at the site.

Geological scientist, Robert
Fakundiny has bccn working for
the energy oilicc investigating West
Valley for the past eight years.
“There has been a great deal of
misinterpretation about West

Valley. The site has good drainage. -

The problem is more technical.
There is a problem with water get-
ting into the trench caps. thcrcforc
producing radioactive watcr."
Fakundiny stated that by standard
definitions this water can be con-
sidcrcd safe Since it meets safe
drinking water regulations.
Fakundiny maintained that one
problem with the trench caps is a
serious one and that the decision to
reopen West Valley would bc based
on not one but many criteria.
However. Lyons pointcd out that
thch are other methods bcsidcs lltc
