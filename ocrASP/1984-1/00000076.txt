Student leaders gather for voter conference

pose civil rtghts. oppose women's
rights and student rights." He add-
ed 'that “you are “either for
everybody's rights or nobody‘s
. rights,"

He said he was impressed with
the attendance at the conference
which. according to organizers. far
exceeded their expectations. "This
could he the most significant stu-
dent assemblage of tltis decade.“
Lowery emphasized. adding that
students must not be afraid to
“challenge the system." i

Moore mentioned that itt the

‘ 1972 presidential election student
voter tttrnout was good. However.

 he noted. the students failed to

follow up on that turnout in l976

 and I980. According to the USA

. Today, only l2 million of 28 million

— eligible l8- to 24-year-olds voted in

‘ the I980 presdential election.
Bttt things can change. according
to Malarkcy. "We‘re building a
 campaign organization." he said.
" adding that students can definitely
have a major impact in I984.
I Malarkey also mentioned the pro-
tests of the 60’s saying that tltcsc
». will be the politics of the l980‘s.
The conference. he added. provided
‘ ophistication not ltad prior to
his."
Cindy Jacques. chairperson of
'Massachusetts Public Interest
Research Group (MASSPIRG) said
‘he too felt that the students were
“going to be making history.” She
ddcd that students “came together”
round a common goal“ and. that.
ow. “we know what needs to be
lé'donc."
 Kim l’attlis, chair of the Califor-
nia Public Interest Research Group

' , gCALPIRG) said the conference

was very effective in that. now.
’{I'égislators will have a different at-
"litudc towards students. “They've
got to pay attention to us." she
aid.

However. not all those in atten-
ttncc agreed with ltow the cott-
‘fercncc was handled. or the issttcs

t\’tll\’C(l. “The people who came
ltcrc to register voters were lied to."

tid Jim Vostnik. a student from

Ohio. Vosmik pointed ottt that.
althougha lot of issues were touch-

  

ed upon. a lot of student issues.
specifically Financial Aid and the
Solomon Amendment. were
noticeably absent from the discus-
sions.

Paulus contintted. saying that the
issues discttssed were. specifically.
the issues brought up. by the
students themselves.

Although all the presidential catt-
didates were invited. only .Iackson
attended the conference. George
McGovern was scheduled to appear
but transportation problctns pro-
hibited his arrival from Iowa.
William F. Buckley. Rev. .lcrry
Falwell and former President
Gerald Ford were also invited. bttt
declined their invitations. according
to Pattlus.

Wexler noted thttt tltc conference
and the speakers educated a lot of
people and gave a lot of people cs-
pcricnce. He added that he was im-
pressed with the media attention
given the event.

chlcr stressed the need to
assimilate local. regional. and
statewide strategies with the na-
tional strategies. He described the
problems in doing this as “the weak
link" in tltc process.

The regional state cattctts' goal
was to strengthen that weak link.
said Wesler. The cattctts' main ob-
jectivc was to “nail down a strategy
for New York State." He said that
the major problem in doing that
was that the University Student
Senate. the “SASU ofCUNY" was
not at the conference. He said that
the voter registration drive needs
their participation becattsc the drivc
will include efforts to get the city‘s
poor and minoritcs registered.

Regarding the issue of a
statewide, coordinated strategy for
voter registration. Tierney noted
that. “we are close within reach.
bttt not there yet." Tierney stated
that in the near future USSA,
SASU. NYPIRG. and student
governments will be getting
together for strategy sessions.

He added that it is obvious that
there is heavy student interest. bttt
that a solid. sophisticated strategy
tnttst be developed to get out the
vote. According to Tierney. getting
the vote ottt will be given. “absolute

top priority for the fall campaign."
by SASU. “There is nothing more
important.“ he emphasized. if
necessary. Tierney said that SASU
could. and will. develop a campaign
to “physically pull thctn (the voters)
out."

chlcr said that he has “great
hopes‘.‘ for the drive saying that
success depends upon the student
media. “The student media'
educates students on issues that are
important.“ he noted. "they put
the issues of the day in students'
faces.” He added that. “the stu-
dent media is the fuzzy elctnent in
the voter registration drive." ch-
lcr emphasized that the student
media. because of its power. must
take the responsibility of making
sure the voter registration is impor-
tant.

The conferencewas deetncd suc- .

ccssl‘ul by all of the organizers.
David Locke. a representative of
the Republican party. said he found
it' “enormously encouraging to
know that young Americans are
concerned about this country and
are willing to do something about
it.“

(“any Kalntan of Clarke Universi-
ty said. thanks to the conl'crencc.
“there is a network ottt there willing
to help us."

Even Jackson. who said he was
pleaded with to attend. expressed
his admiration for the conference.
"I was bounded to death to get
here." he said. “but I‘m sure glad i
came."

Chernenko selected to lead Communist Party

<Front Page
through the official news media as
the country prepared for the httrial
Tuesday of Andropov. who died
Thursday. Andropov had previous-
ly been the oldest man to take over
as general secretary of the party at
age 68.

Soviet television and radio said
Chernenko opened the plenum and
called for a tnintttc of silence to

honor Andropov. whom he praised.

for his domestic and foreign
policies.

Since Chernenko has had virtual-
ly no personal role in foreign tif—
fairs. it is difficult to gauge how he
will approach the biggest problems
of international relations the
deterioration of relations with the
United States and the impasse on

negotiations on control of nuclear
weapons. ,

But Kremlin foreign policy
changed little in tltc transition from
Brezhnev to Andropov; and since
Chernenko has been strongly idcn-
tificd with Brezhnev for decades it
seemed unlikely that he would in-
stituc any radical changes.

(‘hcrncnko‘s ties to Brezhnev
went back 30 ycars. to when he was
party propaganda chief for
Brezhnev in the southern Republic
of Moldavia.

When Brezhnev replaced the
ousted Nikittt S. Khrushchev as
general secretary in I965. he named
Chernenko chief of the party's
General Department. In 1976.
Chernenko was made a member of
the Central Committee Secretariat.

Those responsibilities included in—
tcrnttl party watchdog and national
liaison work.

Last July. it became known that
the (icncrnl Department‘s work was
handed over to Klavdi llogolyttbox.
tt 75-year—old with career links to
Chernenko.

Chernenko emerged as chief par-
ty itlcologist dttring Andropov's
rttlc. although there are indications
that Attdropov kept a strong hand
lll ideological questions.

Chernenko was hospitalized with
pneumonia last spring and unable
to make tltc Red Square parade
marking May Day. He did not ap-
pear in public until tltc mid-.lttnc
Central Committee plcnutn devoted
to ideology in'wltieh ltc made the
opening speech.

According to Smith. tltc Institute
plans to focus on writers of tch

“We‘re looking at well known as
well as ttcw and emerging writers."
he said. Ultimately. the Institute

 

would like to get writers from
around the world. " We are in-
terested in writers who write in
littglislt about foreign countries.“
Smith noted.

Kennedy began writing in I‘MS
for his college newspaper and
literary magazine. In the late 50's he
switched from journalistic writing

to fiction.

Kennedy is the recipient of this
ycttts National Book Cl'lllt‘s Circle
Award for his novel Irmttvectl and
is now working on the screenplay
