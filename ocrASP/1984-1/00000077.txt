places twelfth ‘atCortland

' By Jim Erwin
The Albany State women's indoor track
team took part in the highly competitive Cor-
' tland Invitational last Saturday. A very
talented Cortland team won the meet. while
the Danes placed twelfth. With Division I
‘ teams like Columbia, Syracuse and Bucknell
competing as well as Ithaca and host Cor-
tland. the team did not expect to win. I

The Quality competition, however. did
serve to ready the Danes for post-season
competition. Coach White commented, “I‘m
happy with our season so far. we're progress-
ing nicely. This track meet saw many in-
dividual records set. and many of the girls are
ahead of where I thought they would be,

‘ which is great. The team should be able to
perform up to their potential _ by the
SUNYAC meet. which is what we‘re aiming
for."

The Danes didn't fare well in individual
events. but showed good depth as they placed
all threerelays they ran. The 4x800-meter
relay of Jenn Jones. Donna Burnham. Karen
Kurthy. and Doreen Hutchinson ran very
well. placing fourth with a time of 10:22.6.
The 4x200-meter relay, consisting of Mary
Carmody, Jones. Wanda McFadden and
Hutchinson, placed sixth and finished in
1258.8. The 4x400—meter relay. consisting of
McFadden. Sue Golla,_1(aren Fixler and Car-
mody. also finished sixth with a solid time of ’
4228.3.

had a mediocre dual-meet record. Wrestling
in a weak 158 pound class. Clark drew a bye
in the quarterfinals before edging Onconta's

Clark was soundly beaten by Brockport’s

if there was a single disappointment in the
tournament for Albany. it was the outing of
134 pound John Balog. a freshman who was
expected not only to qualify far the National
Tournament. but to earn All-American
honors. '

Balog. though, has the misfortune of
wrestling in a very competitive weight class at
was proved in his opening match versus
Brockport‘s Mike Franklin, who pinned the
Dane freshman in the ﬁnal round.

Later. Balog won the consolation match to
wind up ﬁfth. Two other ﬁfth place ﬁnishes
were pleasant surprises for coach DeMeo.‘
Heavyweight Papo Rivera and 150 pound Stu‘
Bradish both ﬁnished ﬁfth and were crucial
in Albany's fifth place finish overall, Riv'eray
was wrestling instead of Albany’s lvan “The ;
Terrible” Katz. whom he beat out for the
starting job last week.

For now, the season is history for all but
four Dane wrestlers, who will continue to
practice for the next two weeks in prepara-.
tion for the National Tournament.

with being a member of two placing relays.
shows that this talented freshman is ready to
run with the best.

"Many of the Danes set personal bests

high level of competition. The 5000~meter
run saw three ﬁne Albany performances.
Lynn Jacobs ran a very quick 19:01. followed 1
by Bette Dzamba’s personal best of 19:29.
and Burnham’s 19:36, also a personal best.

In the 3000-meter run. two Dane runners
set personal bests. Maura Mahon ran a very
strong 11:32.1, followed by Chris Varley’s
12:12.1.

Jones continued her progress in the
SOD-meter run with a fine time of 2:33.11. a
personallbest. Jenn was also a member of two
placing relays. which made for a very solid

laden U.S. ﬁgure skating team.

Brother -and sister figure skaters Peter and '
Kitty Carruthers won the United States' ﬁrst
medal of the XIV Winter Olympics Sunday
night, taking the silver in pairs for the best
American placing in that event in.24 years.

“I'm in shock," Kitty said. “I’ve never
been happier in my whole life. I knew it right
before the start. I looked at'Pete, and I knew
it was going to be magic. This is the best
we’ve ever skated.” There was hope for fur-
ther U.S. figure skating success in Judy
Blumberg and Michael Seibert. who were
third two-thirds of the way through the ice-
dancing competition. The medals will be
decided in Tuesday‘s free dance.

< Imagine the irony. The Winter Olympics
have been interrupted by. of all things,
winter. #

Three times now. officials have tried to
hold what many 'consider the Games“ most
glamorous event. the men’s downhill ski
race. But winter has made it impossible.

A storm that has dropped two feet of snow
on the city and sent howling winds across
Mount Bjelasnica has turned the mountain

into a picture postcard. with snow-crusted
trees along the roadside framing the land-
scape like a Currier and [yes print.

Radoslav Marcovic. chief meteorologist
for the city of Sarajevo. said that once every
four or five years. the city experiences this
much snow in February7

<Dr. Michael Woods hit "the wall" with

- three laps to go in the men’s 5,000 meters.

Mark Mitchell and Mark Huck were never in
contention.

The American speed-skating team had its
worst showing so far in the XIV Winter
Olympics Sunday. With four races com.
pleted. the United States has yet to win a
medal. in the 1980 Games, Eric Heiden alone
won five golds. ' .'

“I pushed as hard as I could in the end.”
said Woods. "1 went on a medal-contending
time and l was still in it with a couple of laps
left: But what can you do it you're blown
out?" .

Woods, from Milwaukee. Wis., was 12th
. in 7:24.81. more than 12 seconds behind win-
ner Tomas Gustafson‘ of Sweden. C]

The week didn't start off too well
for the Albany State women's gym-
nastics team. but it sure did end in
fine fashion. On Wednesday. the
Great Danes- were defeated by a
tough University of Vei'mont
squad. but they bounced back to
trounce the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. Harvard Universi-
ty, and Rhode Island College in a
quad meet on Saturday at the
M.l.T. l‘ieldhouse.

The margin of victory was the
real story in the victories Saturday
as the Danes registered a 141.85.
followed “not so closely" by Rhode
Island College with a 131.70,
M.l.T. with a 110.45. and the newly
organized Harvard team with a
39.60. Although Albany has scored
higher as :1 learn in previous meets.
one thing showed true: they have a
learn with plenty of depth.

In the all-around competition.
Missy Maxl'icld I'rom M.l.T. took
the top spot with a 29.80. Albany
grabbed the next two spots with
Brenda Armstrong scoring a fine
29.70 and Karen linilcy a commen-
dable 29.55.

Mttxl‘icitl begun to showcase her
talent immediately on the until. its
she captured the event just ahead of
Albany‘s Terri Sokol and Bailey.
two very consistent finishers all
hUiI‘iUll.

On the uneven parallel burs. it
was time for two more Albany gym-
nasts to do the scoring. A mark 01'
7.90 was recorded by Armstrong
for first place while teammate Anne
Thamasctt took second with n 7.50.
l-larvztrtl's Sully l’agcrson put on at
gallant effort in placing third with a
7.40

Armstrong decided that the taste
of victory was so much sweeter than

beam competition. The senior
Albany State tri-eaptain did well
enough to finish third. The ﬁnal
scores read 7.70. 7.65, and 7.05.
respectively.

Rhode Island College got on the
scoreboard in the final competition-
of the evening. the floor exercise.
but it was a case of “too little. too
late." They took the ﬁrst and se-
cond positions in the event. while
Albany's Bailey ﬁnished a close
third.

The host University of Vermont
team was a little too strong for
Albany on Wednesday night as they

outscored the Danes 153.60 to
146.75.
Albany's high score in the

vaulting competition. an 8.0 by
both Armstrong and Bailey. wasn't
good enough to place in the top '
three spots overall.

Junior tri-captuin Titumasctt
displayed great skill on the uneven
parallel bars as she captured first
with a 7.65. Her teammate Arm-
strong registered u 7.45 for second
place.

The balance beam was dominated
by the Vermont squad. who took
the top two positions. while
Albany‘s Jennifer Cleary had a
sharp third place finish.

.The Danes' Bailey took the floor
exercise with an 8.65. Elicia
Sleinberg also did a fine job by
registering a 8.3.

Albany State’s record is now 6-3.
They travel to Division 111 oppo-
nent New Pain. on Tuesday. Satur-
day‘s meet at Keene State has been
postponed until February 28. Also.
the Danes’ home meet against Long
Island University on Feb. 25. due to
conflicting dates with the state
championships, has been
cancelled. l‘J
