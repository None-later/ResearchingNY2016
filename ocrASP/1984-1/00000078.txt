was gorng to be a classic crowd. l
was right.

 

The Danes defeated the’

Potsdam Bears Saturday night. in
overtime by a score of 62-56. Btti
Albany had a distinct advantage:
they were playing six against live.
Public address announcer Bob
Rice, whose voice could barely be
heard all night over the crowd's
thunderous echo. should have in-
cltrded the crowd along with
Albany‘s starting line-up of
Ursprung. Thomas. Croutier.
Adam and Gosule.

“It was unbelievable.". said
Albany's Adam Ursprung. who
may have just as easily been
describing his 15-point,
ll-rebound performance. “The
crowd was really great.“

“The crowd was great." added
Albany Head Coach Dick Sauers.
“The crowd helped us; they were
our sixth man tonight. They were
the other night against Platt-
sburgh. too. when we were strug-

v gling. They were right into the

game. _It was great. They got their
money‘s worth tonight"

That was an understatement. In
a tense. hotly-contested whale ofa
basketball game. Albany survived
a late comeback by the Bears in

regulation and pulled away in the v

overtime period. The Dancs' Dave
Adam missed a 20~foot jump shot
at the buzzer that would have
given Albany the victory in regula-
tion. At that point. It seemed as if

the momentum had swung over to ‘

  
  
  

Potsdam.
But the Danes wouldn’t let it.
Sauers. when asked what he told

his team following Adam's heart— .

stopping miss. said: “I told
Ursprung where to tip the ball on
the jump ball (at the start of the
OT period)." '

it was at this point that the fans
gave the Danes a huge lift. if the
players came out for the OT feel-
ing a little dejected after Adam’s
miss, the crowd's roar lifted their
spirits and rekindled their momen-
tum.

The freshman with the spr-
ingboard legs controlled the tap
for Albany and after the Danes
patiently worked the ball around.
Ursprung calmly lofted an alley-
oop pass to Wilson Thomas, who
laid in the first two points of the
OT period. Following a missed
lay-up by Potsdam's Pat
Crawford. the ,Danes controlled
the ball patiently as the crowd urg-
ed them on.Ursprung then cut

Albany's “sixth man", the Grout Done inns, played a big part in the Danes' dramatic 62-58 overtime
win over Potsdam Friday night.

Croutier snapped a splendid pass
right into Ursprung's hands.
whose lay-up made it a four-point
lead and gave Albany control of
the game for good. it was asif
Albany and the crowd threw a
tremendous right hook and the
Bears were pinned face down on
the canvas.

Adam. who more than made up
for his missed shot with a magnifi-
cent driving lay-up in the over-
time. was full of high praise for
the fans.

"That was the loudest crowd
l‘ve.seen since l've been here at
Albany," said Albany’s co-
captain, who scored 11 points and
grabbed five rebounds on the
game. “They were awesome. i
thought they were pretty good at
the first Union game in the

Capital District Tournament. but
these guys were awesome. They
were our sixth man tonight. 1

.don’t think we could have won

without them, that's for sure."

Just as the Danes didn't let their
momentum slip away after
Adam’s miss, neither did the fans.
They had gained control of the
game and weren’t going to let it
slip away. You better believe that
the Bears’ horrendous (12-27)
shooting from the foul line had
something to do with the deafen-
ing noise made every time a
Potsdam player stepped to the
line.

On top of everything else, the
crowd behind Potsdam's bench
was so loud that they forced Head
Coach Jerry Welsh to bring his
team out to center court along

 

Ell MARUSSICN UPS

 

with their set of chairs.

Albany’s Jan Zadoorian was
another Dane player who was
thrilled with Albany's sixth man.

“It showed that everybody was
behind us. and it made us play
that much harder," Zadoorian
said. “The game got close. and
the crowd was on ottr side. When
the crowd’s on your side. it's a big
lift to everybody."

The Danes‘ next home game is
Feb. 21 against Hamilton. The
last time i checked Hamilton was
11-1 and ranked second in the
state. But 1 don't think they can
handle the Danes if they have to
play five against six like Potsdam
did.

As Croutier said. “The crowd
made the game.” [1

Most of the teams here at SUNYA belong
to SUNYAC conferences which provide ex-
citement and rivalries such as the Albany-
Potsdam basketball match-up and others.
SUNYAC standings are important to Albany
coaches and players. but there’s another
“conference” closer to home that is impor-
tant in its own right, the Capital Districts. in
track. as in Other sports. winning the Capital
Districts is a matter of pride. it's a good start
on the season and the winner has exclusive
bragging rights over area rivals.

Count the Albany State men's indoor track

team as the best in the Capital District. The '

Danes scored 78 points in the area champion-
ship meet held last Friday to host Union’s 72
points, RPl's 64, Hudson Valley Community
College‘s 38. and Siena's total of 26 points.
Although most track fans had predicted
either the much-improved Union Dutchmen
or the RH Engineers to win. the Albany
squad scored impressively early during the
ﬁeld events and never looked back.

A good deal of that scoring came from-

captain Paul Mance. who put his best foot
forward to win both the long and triple
jump. in the long jump. Mance and junior
Bill Waring both recorded season-best marks
of 21'8" and 20' 9.25" respectively. Waring,
the “heart-attack kid". dramatically moved
from fifth to third on his last jump. Mance
responded to pressure from some tough area
competition in the triple jump, by hoplstcp-
jumping 44' 8.75” for his best effort this year
and ﬁrst-place honors. “Not a bad day for
an old man." Mance said afterwards.

Undefeated Dane thrower Marc Mereurio
also came from behind to take first from a
competitive field in the 35-lb. weight throw.
Remillard of Union led through most of the
finals until Mercurio popped his winning toss
of51'4" to take it. That throw was only three
inches front his school-record mark.

Junior Rej .lamcrson had some problems
with his pole. bttt still was able to take second
in the pole vault‘ after clearing 12'6".
Newcomer Malt Hayes is developing quickly
in ‘his role as the Duncs' only shotputtcr.
Hayes was able to place fourth in the shot
with his throw of 39'] i .25". .

On the track the team solidified its good

position and slowly built up a lead. The
4x800-meter relay of freshmen Gene Shelley,
Jim McDonagh. sophomore lan Clements.
and junior Tom Kacandes finished third
when Kacandes was nippedat the line after
running 2:015, an indoor personal-best time.
The relay was clocked at 8:133. the Danes‘
best so far.

it seems like you just can’t say enough
about sophomore superstar Bruce Van
Tassel. He is Albany‘s only hurdler. and he is
also undefeated this season. Van Tassel runs
every race under pressure to win and comes
through. Saturday. he returned to top form
breaking the tape in 7.0 seconds. a mark

ﬁrst place. ’

in every event, the Danes relied on their
man to score what he could. Albany made up
for its thinness with superior personal effort.
One example of this was junior .lim Erwin in
the 1500-meter run. Erwin ran nearly perfect
splits on the way to a best-ever time of4:05.4.
but was nipped at the tape and ﬁnished third.
That time was an eight second improvement
over his last 1500 effort.

in trying to keep up with Union standout
Winston Britton in the 400-meter dash.
junior .lohn Reilly ran his best time. :52.0,
and qualified for the State Championships as

well as taking second-place points. Senior.
Andy Callari took third despite a mild illness.

Albany stepped up its scoring tempo in the
500~meter dash where sprint star Pat Sac-
cocio and junior'Paul Fauty took ﬁrst and
fourth respectively. Saccocio's time of l:07.6
was a full two seconds ahead of second place.
while Fauty’s l:ll.5 is a season-best mark.
The Albany distance medley relay
(800.400.1200.1600) team of Kacandes. Errol
Johnston. Dave Blette, and captain Ed
McGill finished first in a weak ﬁeld.
Kacandes handed off with 15-meters
breathing room and the team slowly widened
the margin to win with ease in 10:50.

Britton talent haunted the Danes in the
50—mcter dash where he was awarded first in
a close heat while Saccocio, Van'Tassel. and
Reilly finished third. fourth and fifth behind
him.

in the middle distaces. Dane runners catne
back to score despite tiredness from earlier
races. E_rwin went out strong in the 800-meter
run. but fell off from the fast pace to finish

'ﬁfth. In the lOOO-meter run. Kacandes was

outkicked down the stretch. but ﬁnished
fourth and equalled his best time this season.
2:383. Clements and Shelley came back from
the 4x800 relay to finish fourth and ﬁfth in
the 3000-meter run.

This scoring was enough to keep the Danes

ahead of the haying dogs behind them. but

the win was sealed when McGill laid waste to
1 tough field in the 5000-meter run. His winn-
ing time of 15:13 was so fast that he tapped
the second place runner before crossing the
line. Besides qualifying for States. McGill
also recorded the fourth fastest time in NY
Division 111 this season.

The excitement kept building through the
4x400-meter relay. the last event. Albany
team members lined almost ltalf the track
chanting and cheering for the gutsy Dane
team of Callari. Reilly. Johnston. and Sac-
cocio. Union led narrowly through the first

' two legs. but Britton, back again. opened a

gap during the third leg that Saccocio simply
could not close despite his awesome anchor
lcg split of :5l.0. Though seeded six seconds
behind the Dutchmen, Albany’s final time
was 29:33.9 to Union's 3:310. L.

Women cagers assured of .500 with mice win

Tltc Albany State women‘s basketball
team trounced Uticu Tech this past Saturday
at University Gym by a score of 60-44. The
win puts the Danes‘ record for the year at
12-8. and assurcs them of at least a .500
season. , -

Diane Fernanch led the Danes with 13
points. but more important to the team was
the intcnsity shc displayed on the cottrt.
Albany had opened up a 19-10 lead which
soon dwindled to 19-17 due to some erratic
passes and overall sloppy play. licrnundcs
then helped tltc Danes regain their corn-
posurc by making some big defensive plays
on the way to a 31-23 half-time lead.

“When Utica Tech cut the lead to two, we
knew something had to bc done." remarked
Albany Head Coach Mari Warner. “Diane
started hustling and that got its going."

Debra Logan also kept things going nicely
for [lie Danes. She replaced starting Alhuny
point guard Raiuny Lesanc throughout the
game and made things tick with her precision
passes. “Debra didn't score. bill when she
catne in. she run things well." stated Warner.
“She had a very nice game."

The second half belonged to Albany us
Ronnie Patterson and Nancy (irrnso pumped
home 10 and 8 points, rcspcctivcly. in leading
the women cagers to the blowout. Warner
was fairly pleased with the way the game
went. “We didn't play well the first half. bttt
we ran our offense better in the second half."
she said. “We got better fast breaks."

The Wildcats of Utica Tech had one main
weapon. Center Diane llcnowski, who
poured in 32 of ltcr team's 44 points.
Benowski averages over 28 points per game.

“We tried everything to stop her,” ex-
plaincd Warner. “We tried fronting her, go»
ing man to man, playing a zone, packing into
the key area. Nothing worked; she did
everything well."

The Duties were 10-22 from the free throw
line. a statistic Warner was happy with. The
Danes have been struggling from the line.
“l'm glad to see we went to the line 22
times." said Warner. “We have to go to the
hoop and try to get that foul."

Going into Saturday's garlic. Albany was
coming off of a 65-58 loss to Hamilton last
Thursday night. The Danes were up by five
with five minutes to go, bttt seven con-
sccutivc lurnovcrs tttrncd things around.

With 48 seconds to go anti Albany trailing
by 3. the Danes threw the ball away on an in-
bounds pass and thus were forced to foul.
Hamilton did not seem to be bothered by this
as they trailed 21 of 28 shots from the charity
line. '

Tonight the Danes host Hartwick. a quick
team with size inside. Warner notes. "We
can't afford the turnovers and poor foul
shooting. We have to put it all together for
this game."

The fifth annual Capital District Tourna-
tncnt will be held this weekend at University
Gym. Albany will attempt to defend their ti-
tlc against the College of St. Rose. RPl, and
Union. The four teams iii the tourney are no
strangers to each other as every team has fac-
cd one another this year. “This should be a
top-class tournament,“ said Warner. “There
will be four very competitive games."

Tile College of Saint Rose was victorious in
the first two Capital District tournaments.
Union won two years ago. and Albany took
it last year. And what about 1984'? Warner

.has this thought: “From an RPl standpoint.

they‘re saying ‘it's our year'. We won't let
that happen."
All the action begins this weekend.

FAST BREAKS: A bit of history will be in
the making Friday night when WCDB will
broadcast live the Albany— RPI game It's
the first time 91 FM will air a women‘s
basketball game.
