Approximater forty‘ black ’

students crowded into the room in
which Central Council was meeting
last Wednesday. They were there to
demonstrate their support for a bill
that would ease the financial
burden on the Albany State Univer-
sity Black Alliance (ASUBA). The
bill passed unanimously.

In other Council business. a bill
that would establish an interview
policy for Student Association was

withdrawn. and a bill that would ‘

revise the athletic controller‘s posi-
tion was passed. and then rescinded

' at the end of the Council session.

tested that the financial pressure on
social-cultural groups. such as
ASUBA. was excessive. He concur-

in the meeting to prove that
