. Civic center 

A Sheraton Corporation ofﬁcial has con-
firmed reports that it is the company is con-

downtown Albany if a civic center is built
there. according to an article in Wednesday's
Times Union.

In addition. the article said that the Albany
County Civic Center Commission may hear
another proposal from Colonie developer Sal
Beltrone. but no date for that proposai's in-
troduction has been set.

Currently. the commission has received
two proposals. the first from local developer
Joseph Futia to build an arena behind the
Colonic Coliseum. which he owns. and a se-
cond proposal from SUNYA President Vin-
cent O'Leary to place a ,civic center and
lleldhouse complex on University land near
the uptown campus.

New bids for SA-AV

Student Association Vice President Jeff
Schneider reports that SA has received three
new bids on its Audio-Visual equipment. He
also said that SA had the system appraised a
second time, but he would not release the
ﬁgure so as not to influence bidding.

The system had been appraised previously
at being worth between $32,000 and 360.000.
SA has spent an estimated $I20.000 on the
system over the past three years.

 

   
 
  
   
   
  

According to Schneider. there are now 12
bids made for the system. A final decision on
which bid to accept or whether or not to ac-
tually sell the system will be made in March,
he said.

Humanities Lounge

Dean of Humanities Paul Wallace is cur-
rently collecting opinions from faculty and
students on the closing of the Humanities
Lounge (rm 354) in the afternoons.

“l've received strong support from the
faculty and: department chairs mostly
unanimously in favor of present policy."
which involves closing the Humanities
Lounge at ":30 am. each day, contended
Wallace.

Petitions to keep the lounge open in the
afternoon are currently circulating the cam-
pus. according to Wallace.

“it's too valuable a facility to be con-
sidered lightly." said Wallace. “i'm trying to
get as much information" as possible from
those who use the lounge. he said.

he is rcndying himself to light what
ltc sees as an attempt to “kill” his
magazine. "Last spring there was a
big drive to kill Nadir. too." ltc ad-
dcd. '

Michelle Krcll. tltc editor of The
Albany Review. rcl‘uscd to com-

although she did say that she was
against it. “He (Barsky) has very lit-

Benson snid that u merging of the

the reasons the magazine failed to

given a minimum income line which
it was obliged to repay, in what
Benson describes as a "trade-off."

“They were very resistant to the
idea of two iiteraly magazines."
Benson said. “We have to conserve
more." Barsky said, observing that
the two magazines fill similar needs.
unlike Nemesis. which has a dif-
ferent focus. “We don’t have the

Benson. on the other hand.

we've bccrt very successful. l’rol'cs-

Both Benson and Kneli stressed
that the competition betwccn the
two magazines was a beneficial
thing. “llcalthy competition serves
to increase quality". Benson said.
“if you have a monopoly, quality
goes down. There's no need for it.
bccausc you have no competition."

Most SUNYA professors rcztchcd
had no opinion on the nutttcr. but
those who expressed an opinion
seemed to feel that two magazines
were more desirable than one.

“The fact that we have two
magazines is very beneficial." said
Professor Donald Byrd. “l've seen
