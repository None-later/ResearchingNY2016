university decided it would be too
expensive to rebuild it as a dor-
mitory. according to Welch.
UniVersity officials have examin-
‘ ed the Thruway House Hotel, on
Washington Avenue across from
the SUNYA campus, as a possible
source of additional student hous-
ing. said Welch.
“We're not sure the terms (at the
Thruway House) would be anything
like what the Wellington offered."

said Welch. but “anything with that
facility would not be long term
leases."

The management of the Thruway
House has been contacted by
SUNYA officials. according to
Pogue, but no final decision has
been made. Pogue said that the 0f-
fice of Residential Life Was looking
into other alternatives for housing.

Residential Life ofﬁcials were
unavailable for comment. ['1

Majority leader Warren Anderson,
said, “The Rolison bill has not yet
been discussed in Senate con-
ference." As for the Governor's
proposal he said that Senator
Anderson is not enthusiastic about
raising the drinking age und would
like to scc more information on
wltut happens til the present (drink-
ing) age."

Elizabeth A. Murphy. Legislative
Associate for Spcukcr of the
Assembly Stancly l-‘ink. said. “The
assembly is currently looking into
various liccnsc sanctions but it is
really too early to suy what the out-
come will be."

As for Governor Cuomo's pro-
posal to misc the drinking age to 21.
he is meeting strong rcsistuncc from
SASU as well as bur owners and Il-
quor distributors. lluutnun termed
it “selective prohibition. You cttn
get married. have kids. get a mor-
Igugc bttt not have u drink. thttt's
ridiculousi.” hc suid.

Roger Martel. owner of the
Lamp Post. said that bar owners
are in u “Catch-22" situation. “If
that (Rolison's bill) is an alter-
native, then..wehuvc tosnpport it."

Commenting on the 21 year old
drinking age proposal. Baumun

said. “42 percent of the people in
the age group don't even hold
licenses. We would be unjustly
punishing the majority."

For bar owners who cater to the
under twenty-one crowd, raising the
drinking age will bring on economic
hardship for tltcm as well as others,
according to Buumutt. It would be
harmful to othch hesich himself.
he cxpluincd. “I would have to lay
off at large purl of my stuff. It
would also hurt lily supplicrs ull thc
wuy front the mun who sells chicken
wings to my hccr distributor."

He also suit]. “Those rcstuurunt
owners thut huvc oldcr crowds,
don‘t give u dumnl They don't
think it will affect them. but it will.
because il'l lost the younger crowd l
um going to go after their crowd.
Everybody loscs."

lloor, owner of the Long Brunch
and the Griffin. suid. “It is con-
ccivuhlc thut raising the drinking
ugc to 2] could put Inc out of
business. I would have to lay off
hull" of my cmployccs right away."
He also said that lighting the
Governor's legislation is the
associuiton‘s highest priority.

For Martel. the old adage holds
true — “If you are old enough to go
to war, then you‘re old enough to
have u drink." I '
