ork for us. 2

Editor: I

the treasurer of a very small SA funded organization. i
larmed to receive notiﬁcation through a letter from the
ontroller. Adam Barsky. that our group’s budget had
frozen. Upon immediate investigation re'quiring a visit
ntroller Barsky's ofﬁce, we were made av'vare that the
(or our predicament was the fact that the amount of
we’ve yielded toward our income line was not equal to
ount of academic year elapsed. Simply because more
i alf an'scademic year is over, we are expected to have
more than half the amount of our required yearly in-
This is not an unreasonable expectation. and it is true
e've failed to do so. However. as the SUNYA French
our income is dependent upon the sale of french baked
during large scale university-community events such as
ts’ Weekend and World Week. Our income is addi-
ly supplemented by the sale of bagels in the Campus
r.
as. in fact. at the time that l was submitting to SA a rc-
for a solicitations permit for our bagel sales that t
ed the notiﬁcation about our budget. Subsequently.
sc our budget is frozen. our request for a table in the
us Center will not be honored: nor. then. would a re-
,for a voucher to obtain fundraising monies to pay 'for
we would sell. v

s was explained to Controller Bursky. as was the fact
he club had been experiencing difficulties due to the
' - hat the club's long-term prcsidcnt had graduated in

r Barsky was told. is that Lc Ccrclc Fruncais is a pro—
ve participant in tire university's Ethnic Block Party on

pcctcd to yield a large percentage of our income. Never-
theless, our words were for naught. Controller Barsky, as the
club's president was told. had other people with whom to
speak. and regardless of the club's circumstances. he would
not help us. Furthermore. the budget would remain frozen
until half the amount present on our income line was submit-
ted to SA.

The only obvious solution is to take the money from our
own pockets. However. I don't feel that it is right to expect
the members of our organization to contribute large funds of
their own. and somehow, i suspect that Controller Barsky
would not reach into his own pocket to help. if , hypothetical-
iy. SA had similar ﬁnancial difﬁculties. i will not make to
Controller Barsky an impassioned accusation of
"bureaucrat." nor will I question his regard for humanity. i
would merely like to tell him that our club is at an impasse.
We've no chance to place at rest those ﬁgures waiting so im-
patiently on our income line. A popular slogan of thc Stu-
dent Association on this campus is “Lct SA work for you."
Well. Controller Barsky. please tell us how.

Uncivic center

To the Editor:

Prcsidcnl O‘Lcary's latest attempt at sclf—aggmndizcmcnt
involvcs the proposed Civic Center. As a SUNYA facility
ttictiibcr and as a rcsidcni of the neighborhood ltc plans to
victimizc. i am outragcd by his proposal.

Who‘s going to pay for tire conscqttcnccs of O‘chu'y's
cdil’icc complex? llc has admitted to it cost of $25 million.
and that figure doesn't includc the inevitable cost ovcrruns.
Regardless of wltcthcr tltc Civic Ccntcr is financed by thc
federal state or locttl govcrtuncnl. it is the tilt'cudy ovcr-
burdcnctl trixprtycr who will pay. Also. I wouldn't bc surpris—
cd to scc students cvcntually forcctl to assume sonic of lhc
costs.

The proposed Civic Ccnlcr is one more illustration of the
low priority O‘Lcttry placcs on education at SUNYA. Our
studcnts arc forch to take lurgc lcclurc clusscs and are closcd
out of courses because we don't have enough tcachcrs. wc
have a shortage of classroom space, our library is understaff-
cd and doesn't have enough books. while O’Lcary is trying to
get $25 million for :1 Civic Center.

Most of tire people in my neighborhood arc vehemently
opposed to the Civic Center. We know that we‘re going to
suffer from the noise. the crowds. the trafﬁc congestion and
the automobile pollution. And to add insult to injury, as tax-
payers wc’il be forced to help finance the destruction of our
neighborhood. SUNYA has always enjoyed good relations
with the surroudning community. Why spoil that~now?

Respect others .

To the Editor:

“is there no respect of place. persons. nor time. in you?"
Shakespeare. Twelfth Night.

The persons who rcmovc. writc upon or otherwise deface
the posters placed upon podium bulletin boards might ask
themselves that question. Campus groups expend money and
energy planning and advertising the wide-range of co-
curriculnr events occurring on this campus. When posters
and ilycrs arc marred or removed prior to the date of an ac-
tivity. event sponsors have cause to be dismayed and
frustrated at the insensitivity expressed by those who damage
event advertisement. Respect for the cultural. ethnic.
religious and racial diversity present at SUNY is a central
aspect of this campus‘ life. That is a primary theme of a ma-
jor event occuring February 27-March 3. World Week.

i ask simply that persons lcavc removal of posters and
llycrs from podium bullcting boards to the individuals who
hear responsibility for that task.

Red-baiting
To the Editor: '

So Timothy L. Taylor writes but yet another letter. Good
for himi But just one moment please. things seem to be going -
from bad to worse. ' l .

Taylor initially wrote a letter to the ASP criticizing campus
socialists groups (DSA & YSA). l have no qualm with that.
it's certainly his right to express his opinion. Prof. Wittner
responded to Taylor's article. offering his opinion on the
matter. He has rights too. Then Taylor wrotcr yet another
letter (his rights again). to which Prof. Wittncr and i both
felt compelled to respond to. Well wouldn't you know he
wrote another letter; can you believe it? i hope at this point
you're following me. necdlcss to say i'm responding again.
But this time i'm displeased and upset.

i know i really shouldn't accuse Taylor of red-baiting in
his last article, seeing as how he did that a long time ago. But
events have gone too far now, and its truly a shame too.
Specifically. Taylor quotes tne as referring to “capitalist im-
perialism" regarding the foreign economic policies of the
Western industrial powers. particularly the U.S. l have no
problem with that. seeing as that is what i said. and believe.
No. that's not the probicm. The problem lay in the fact that
in tltc same sentence he says that such a phrase as “capitalist
imperialism" is often used by the Soviet news agency. Tnss.
Just what is he trying to say? i think we all know.

What had been a respectable exchange of opinions in thc
ASP. has now dccnycd into a forum for immature insinua-
tions. and what truly should be called rcd-baiting. Aaaagh!
Llow lastclcss. Taylor. it seems. shall never be a scholar. its a
)ity too. Personally. I bclicvc his lcttcrs arcn'l worthy of be-
ng printed in the ASP. Of course. that's for thc ASP to
.lccidc.

Psych out

To the Editor:

Recently. a walled-in obstruction has been built in front of
LC 2!. Bearing the legend. “KEEP OUT" in bright red in-
dustrial stencil. one cannot but wonder whether some bizarre
experimentation upon 1ch animals is being carricd out. or is
it perhaps amass-psychological cxpericment being carried
out on the unwitting populace of this university? Strategical-
ly placed in the hallways in front ofa large window. one can
plainly see from numerous vantage points that there is
nothing whatsocvcr'contained within this enclosure. This br-
ings us to present a hypothesis: is the psychology department
(or some other body) using tactics of deception by placing
this obstacle in thc midst of our everyday trafﬁc as part ofan
experimental study for purposes at which one can only
guess? if the focus of this study is to evoke a public response
of outrage. then the game is over and the bluff has been call-
cd. What other purpose can these structures scrvc bcsidc
their imposition on our otherwise harried passage between
classes? We urge the immediate cessation of this situation.

Barroom brawls

To the Editor:

in response to the article “Albany Bar Owners" (page 7) in
the Feb. l4 issues. we would like to praise your article for in-
vestigating aggressive bchaVior in Albany bars. Mr.
Sabalino's comments showed him most knowledgeable
about this serious problem.

However. we found Long Branch owner Bob Boor‘s com-
tncnts showed a serious lack of understanding of thc problctn
of bar room violence. We also found it disturbing that thc
ASP would present such :1 biased and ignorant vicw.

As quoted front the article. Bob Boor i'ccls thul :tlcohul is
not thc triggering mcchanism of aggrcssivc bchuvior. Mr.
llour also places an emphasis on “very aggrcssivc scrccnlng"
til tlic door. He also claims that his stuff can “tell u lot from u
pcrsott's cycs" (is to whether they will l‘lC potcntittl l‘igltlcrs.

there arc major brawls inside tltc Lottg Branch. Apparently
Mr. Boor's “very aggressive screening" policy and his
psychic staff do n0i dctcr potential and actqu brawlcrs.

We strongly urge the staff of the ASP to seek more credi-
blc sources of information when reporting on subjects as
relevant and important as this. Thank you.
