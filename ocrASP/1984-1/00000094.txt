Marines pullout

Beirut, Lebanon
(AP) U.S. Marines settled into new quarters
on Navy ships off Beirut’s coast Monday

while rebel militiamen took over some of the
Americans’ vacated bunkers at the interna-
tional airport.
Shortly after the Marines completed their
pullout Sunday, the battleship New Jersey
shelled Syrian positions that ﬁred at and
missed a US. reconnaissance plane. Leaders
of the Syrian-backed insurgents reportedly
called the U.S. ambassador to protest the
shelling.
Fighting between government troops and
rebels subsided Mondayiafter day-long skir-
mishes in downtown Bierut Sunday. An
American priest and a French soldier were
among those killed.
About 1,000 Marines pulled out of their
fortiﬁed bunkers at the airport during a
lZ-hour operation that ended at midday Sun-
day. when the last amphibious personnel car-
rier splashed into the Mediterranean and
headed for the 6th Fleet ships off' the Bierut

Department, Pentagon and several other
agencies are trying to draft a pact that Was
promised last month by Secretary of State
George P. Schultz during a speech in
Stockholm. No deadline has been set.

Whether the Soviets will accept such a trea-
ty, of course, is still an open question,
although there have been public hints that
Moscow is willing to deal on a new pact.

Reagan's critics, pointing to the chilly rela-
tions between the two superpowers, question
the president’s commitment to arms control
even though he has repeatedly stated in re-
cent months that he considers arms limitation
to be a high priority.

Tax Increases crafted

Washington, D. C.
(AP) While White House and congressional
negotiators remain at a standoff on develop-
ing a strategy to stem federal deﬁcits, key
committees of the House and Senate are tak-
ing it upon themselves this week to craft
modest tax increases to at least slow the bor-
rowing skid.

Senate Finance Chairman Robert J. Dole,
R-Kan., called his panel back to work Mon-
, day in hopes of finishing by mid-week a
package of tax boosts and budget cuts worth
$100 billion to the treasury over three years.
. That $l00 billion is the “down payment"

bipartisan agreement on the deficit issue. But

Reagan, so far, has spurned any notions of
'substantlal tax boosts, claiming that there are
major savings to be found in non-defense
spending.

Whatever form it may take, that's still not
,much of a down payment. The Congressional
Budget Ofﬁce says the deficit, even with ma-
jor cuts in defense spending, could top $300
billion a year by the end of the decade.

Lake causes damage

Salt Lake City, Utah
(AP) The Great Salt Lake, swollen by two
winters of record snow and rain, already has
caused more titan $100 million in damage
without harming homes. Now officials say it
threatens to back its tributaries into city sub-
divisions.

The brackish inland sea, which covers
about IO million square acres, has been rising
almost constantly during two years of record
rain and snowfall and below~normal
evaporation.

Concerned agencies and lakeside industries
are scrambling to raise dikes protecting

businesses and transportation lines before
spring runoffs push the levels even higher.

The lake surface is now 4,206.5 feet above
sea level. Total damages and costs of flood
prevention are estimated to reach $ll7

nillion by the time the lake gets to 4,207 feet,
said Stan Elmer of the Utah Division of State
Lands and Forestry.

Staff levels disputed

Under the Legislature's plan, specific unit.
level goals would be set for the Slate Univn.

I Cuomo budget examined aS‘AU confrence

By Bob Hanlon

Students charging that the SUNY
system feels’like an abused child In
the governor's “family” of state
programs, were reassured Saturday
by State Division of Budget analyst
Frank Walters that there's no
“sinister force" at work.

Walters was addressing a group
of about 75 student leaders atten-
ding a legislative conference run by
Student Association of the State
University (SASU) this weekend.

Walters described the budgetary ‘

process as “an effort to balance
dissatisfaction" between competing
groups who want more from the
state's ﬁnancial plan.

Students accused the Cttomo ad-
ministration of being unfair to
higher education. Walters replied
that the SUNY-CUNY budget
reduction was 2.9 percent as com-
pared wilh 3.9 percent or more for
other state agencies.

Walters wielded a large number
of documents, budget materials,
and other aids to explain tlte tedious
budgetary process.

The budget analyst maintained
that the governor is concerned with
providing continued access for
everyone who wants to attend col-
lege. He added that the proposed
TAP increase would offset the tui-
tion bike for the percent of full-time
undergraduates eligible for the pro-
gram. He noted that the Higher
Education Services Corporation
had come to that conclusion. not

governor’s office supports addi-
tional funding for SUNY. “The
governor continues to have a very
weak committment to higher educa-
tion," he asserted.

In addition to the budget,
students pressed Walters on other
aspects of educational policy such
as dormitory rent increases, utility
fees and community college issues.

power over the educational objec-
tives of either the SUNY Board of
Trustees or the governor and that
those questions should be redirected
to them. D.O.B., he said, simply at-
tempts a fair allocation based on
the governor's guidelines.

Drinking Age Hike Discussed

Francine DelMonte, a legislative
aide to Assemblyman Joseph Pillit-
tcre of Niagara Falls, told the
stttdents that Pillittcre “feels you
should be able to decide how much
(alcohol) you can consume"
without penalizing those between 18
and 21 years old.

She presented statistics that

claimed to disprove any relation-

between drunk driving arrests and
the drinking age. “Nineteen year-
olds were involved in more drunk
driver accidents after the law" rais-
ing the drinking age to l9 went into
effect on December 5, 1982.
Accordittg to DelMonte, there
were 466 traffic accidents involvittg
nineteen year-olds between
December of 1982 and June I983,
as opposed to 430 accidents in the

same period a year before. These
statistics were contained in a packet
assmebled by Pillittcre which asked,
“Is raising the drinking age really
proving to be an effective deter-
rent?"

DelMonle said that groups such
as Mothers Against Drunk Drivers,
Students Against Drunk Drivers,
and Remove intoxicated Drivers
had added to the current conser-
vative political climate and
heightened the national trend

' toward raising the drinking age.

“I tend to feel, however, that the
Legislature won't go through with a
21-year-old drinking age" this year,
DelMonte said, adding that any
federal legislation on the drinking
age would lead the way for the in-
dividual states, and that New York
will most likely wait for federal
legislation to be put in place.

Director of the Senate Higher
Education Committee Mary Ann
MacLean-Austen urged the group
to be up to date on the issues when
they visit legislators and to listen to
the legislators' concerns. She also
emphasized that students should

speak to their own representatives
in the Assembly and Senate.

Machan-Austen said that the
legislators “want to hear what you
have to say" and that they would
like “to hear what is good on the
campuses." They like to kttow that
their efforts have resulted in some
good for higher education, she add-
ed.

Tierney said he was very pleased
Nith the conference. “The con-
‘erence was great," he said, adding
hat, “we had a good student tur-
trout."

“There were a lot of people there
from the governor’s ofﬁce, the
Senate and the Assembly," said
Tierney. “The legislature seems to
be in favor of putting back the
necessary funds to stop cutting
SUNY,” he contended. This,
Tierney maintained, is due to direct
pressure from students.

Tierney noted that "the fact that
the students don't vote is a major
problem in receiving support from
the legislature and the governor.1[]_

'N.Y. legislative director criticizes shortage

of women taking part in state government

By Johanna Clancy

More women ltavc to get elected
and involved with campaigns and
issues, according to Legislative
Director Louise Stoney of the New
York State Assembly Task Force on
Women's Issues.

Stoney spoke Saturday night on '

Women and life N YS I ‘ ' c as
part of the SASU legislative con-
ference. She explained that the Task
Force on Women's Issues is
designated to “review legislative im-
pact on women, and to either sup-
port or oppose these issues.

Stoney noted that women repre-
sent "barcly 20 percent" of the'
legislature. “23 out of 210 seats."
are filled by women. according to
Stoney.

“information is power,"
xlcclarcd Stoney. One main function
of the task force is to get informa-
tion out to people, by speaking to
rarious groups, she explained.

At the beginning of each session
of the Assembly, the task force
prints a report which sums up what
Itas taken place the past year with

' women’s issues, said Stoney. The

report also states what bills are cur-
rently being supported In the State
Legislature, she explained.

The Task Force on Women's
Issues researches bills which are to

go before the legislature, said
Stoney. She also mentioned sevcra
hills which had recently been signe
into law.

The task force has bccn par-
ticularly responsible for the

sion in rape," said Stoney. The rape

Other bills Stoney memtioned
were the prohibition of discrimina-
tion in apprenticeships and the
Working Parent's Act, which
allows companies to deduct daycare

. centers they build for employee's

children from their state taxes. said

- Stoney.

Another health related bill under
consideration by the Senate is a bill
that would allow DES victims to sue

for damages up to tltrcc years after
they are notified of any DES related
injuries, she said. DES is a drug
that was adtninislercd to pregnant
women between 1950 and I972 to
prevent miscarriages.

Stoney also said that the task
’orce was researching video display
erminal radiations and possible
radiation hazards.

The task force also researches
issues that require more com-
prehensive study, according to
Stoney. As examples, she noted the
impact of Rcaganomics on women,
especially older women's welfare,
and tlte comparable worth issue.

Stoney deﬁned the comparable
wortlt issue as the unequal asses-
mcnt of jobs and pay for women.
“We want the skill and working
condition to compare with pay,"
added Stoney. “We want Civil Ser-
vice to keep track of which jobs
paid poorly, hOpefully this will
trickle over to private business,"
she said. Stoney added that the

tCiVil Service Employees Associa-
tion will be doing the study.

Stoney is a graduate of SUNY-
Stony Brook with a BA is Social
Science and a Masters in Social
Welfare. She has been working on
the Women's Issues Task Force for
three years. CI
