Wltile doing research in the

biology lab a professor and his cot-
laborators stumble upon a new
idea. something they were not ex-
pecting to find, and where the,
discovery goes from there is a cont-
plicated process that could restrlt in
patents or copyrights and subse-
quent royalties.

The SUNY Office of inventions
and Licenses at the SUNY Research

3 ‘r at the university according to Coor- various (
y  dlnator. of Sponsored Programs in

', X. 3 the Office for Research at SUNYA,

,. g 4 Frank DiSanto. This SUNY-wide essential
i f office first investigates the claims of digestive
 ;‘ I new ideas, decides whether or not it

‘t '  really is something new, then works along wit
P g as an intermediary between the in-

  

ventors and lawyers, the patent of-
fice and eventually outside corpor-
tations that would develop the
discovery, explained DiSanto.

Royalties from inventions are
. shared by the inventor. the campus
, :- and the SUNY Office of inventions
J . and Licenses, said DiSanto. Pro-
fessors and graduate students work-
ing on assistantships are employees
of the university, he explained, and
as such must sltare royalties with
the university.

New computer programs con-
sidered a copyright property. not
inventions, according to SUNY
Assistant Vice-Chancellor for
‘ Research Herbert McArthur. Tltese
i belong to the inventor unless the
E taeulty member uses university time

to work on them, irt which case the
copyrigltt goes to tire professor with
the university sltaring in the
royalties.

But discoveries at SUNYA have
been concentrated in the fields of
biology, chemistry anti physics. ac-
cording to DiSanto. innovations
are most often new ideas or pro-
cedures in handling materials. he
explained.

For some would-be inventors,
their hopes are shattered. "There
are a number of claims where peo-
ple feel they have an invention, but
some fall by the wayside," said
DiSanto. It's a long examination
process and the legal procedure
could take years, he explained.

Their new idea still takes several

in an interview Monday evening.
Schaffer explained that while he
was living on Alumni Quad last
year. the hall bathrooms were
cleaned once a day. He also men-
tioned that some balls had
maintenance problems at the begin-
ning of the fall 1983 semester.

Assistant to the Vice-President
for Business and Finance Mike Cor-
so was the final speaker at the rally,
and he told the crowd to work
against the bike as hard as possible,
"without a fight you get stepped on
and walked on,” he said. New York

Corso maintained “incredible col-
lege and ttnivcrsity systems, SUNY.

Alan (iordon, one senior who
moved off-campus iii the middle of
the past year, said. “Off-campus
there is more privacy and freedom

The survey also showed that what
students like least about living off-
campus was titling the buses, t.‘\t.'ll
though they did comment that bus
service has improved. Male students
reported that cleaning was a major
dislike in off-campus living. This
was not surprising to Moitaire. who
commented, "The biggest problem
with students is getting them to
keep the apartments clean, especiall-
ly when they are moving ottt at the
end of the year."

Assistant Director of Residential
Life. Liz Marcolini-thdko, pointed
out that students on Alumni Quad
generally move off earlier titan

“i think if we go down there (to
the legislature) this year...maybe we
can have a bit of an impact," Corso
said. Speaking of legislators, he
said,“they have two rules. one, get
elected, and two never forget the
first."

Gawley said the rally was a suc-
cess in that one of the major aims of
the rally was to recruit people to
lobby State Senators and Assembly
members. According to Gawley 25
people volunteered. “We’re
shooting for control this year," he
said about the student lobbying.

Gawley said SA believed that a visit
by 7 or 8 students with a senator or
' assembly member was more effec-
tive.
Gawley said that groups have met
‘with “at least 25-30 (legislators)
who have expressed support for

every legislator. but right now the
