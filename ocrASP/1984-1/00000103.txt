It ' says something about tltis
year's edition of the Albany State
men’s indoor track team that
despite illnesses and injuries, the
Danes were still able to pull out a
third place and beat out host RPI at
the very competitive Marty
McDonough Invitational held last
Saturday.

Cortland State won tltc nteet with
“6 points. wltile Ithaca College
finished second with 96.5 points.
Albany scored 81 points, RPI
finished with 72.5. arid Binghaniton
totaled 48 points for fifth place.

Still perfecting his technique.
junior Marc Merctirio won the
JS-Ib. weight lhl’0\V_l‘L‘l again. After
focusing his concentration on a pro-
blctn with the speed of his turns.
Mercurio stretched his winning
streak to nine straight by popping a
beautiful SI‘8" throw to move
from third to first in the weight
event. Said Mercurio, “I need the
pressure. I feed on it, but my father
worries a lot when I’m behind like
that. The strong field definitely
helped me."

Mercurio being the exception.
Saturday was a sub-par day for the
Danes in general. The team's pro-
blems in the field events were
typical of Albany‘s difficulties at
RPI. The lone Albany pole vaulter.
senior Rej Jamerson, was too ill to
compete. while Dane shotputter
Rich Hayes did not make the trip.

ing first and second. Dane jumpers

Junior John Reilly led off the
relay and took third in the
400-nietcr run with a time of :53.1.
Sophomore Ian Clements looked
silky smooth through most of the
5000-meter run where his personal-
bcst time of 15:28 placed him third

Clements. “Some of the guys were

trouble concentrating and were
unable to “pop a good one". The
long jump came first and Mance's
placing suffered from a lack of
mental focus. f‘The competition
wasn't that hot. really. but I only
had one very good jump and that
might have won it. but I fouled."
Mnnce explained later. His best
legal jump was measured at 20'5".
which was good enough for fifth
place. In the triple jttmp. Mnnce
was able to ptit together several de-
cent efforts. including the jump of
43'825“ that earned him third
place overall. “I’m happy that I got
this bad day out of the way. because

SUNYACS where it counts."

A tired Ed McGill failed to com-
mit himself to hanging with the
leaders of the ISOO-nietcr run early
on and was unable to make tip
enough ground with his kick
finishing third iii 4:012. “It‘s been
a rough week." he admitted.“btit
that’s no excuse. I‘m still learning
how to run this short stuff." Later
on. McGill lead the 3000-meter run
only to fall off the quick pace and
finish fourth. "I need to get more
sleep." he remarked.

Though hampered by a bad cold.

meet record in the 45-mcter dash.

ﬁbril?»

She can’t hit forty-foot jump-
shots or snatch tough rebounds off
the rim. She can’t smack home runs
or catch no-hitters. However. what
she can do is far more important to
any team. Senior Peg Squazzo has
found the formula for success; hard
work and determination. This is
what has made her one of Albany’s
ﬁnest athletes.

Squazzo's list of impressive
Albany credentials starts with
Coach Mari Warner’s women's
basketball team. As co-captain of
this year‘s squad. Squazzo becomes
he first Albany State women‘s
Jaskctball player ever to compete
for four seasons, a record which
also pleases Warner. The question
arises as to why Warner chose
Squazzo as a captain. Being a non-
starter with limited skills is not nor»
mally what makes a captain
of an athletic team. However.
Warner has found things in Squaz-
zo that are rare in an athlete today.
“Things don’t come easy for Peg
on the court.” said Warner. “but
Peg is a hard worker who gives [00
percent and always volunteers to
help." Warner also points out that
Squazzo makes up for her court
deficiencies with her very depen-
dable attitude and her vast
understanding of the game. Tltesc
are two facets of an athlete that
don't always show up in the box-
score.

It's been a long journey to the
top for Squazzo but she feels it was
worth it. “It was something I
wouldn't have missed for the world
and being named captain was the
highlight of my career." A virtual
newcomer to the game irt 9th grade.
Squazzo went on to play four
seasons at lrvington High School in
Westchester, where she was named
All-League two years in a row.

When Squazzo is finished with
the long basketball season, her
work still isn’t done. When spring
time rolls around, Squazzo returns
to her first love; softball. For three
seasons. Squazzo has been a
member of Albany’s women's soft-
ball team. In her case, simply being
a member of the team was quite an
achievement. In two of her three
seasons, Squazzo has been the vic-
tim of injury. During her freshmen
year. she tore her ankle ligaments
and was in a cast for six weeks. “I
was so disappointed I couldn't
Play." said Squazzo. “It just made
me work harder next year.” In her
sophomore year. Squazzo played a
backup role as catcher as the squad

won the SUNYAC chan‘tpionship‘

under Coach Lee Rhenish. Injury
struck Squazzo again in her junior
year and her love for softball had to
be put on hold. Despite her injuries.
Squazzo e’ould often be found on

' the sidelines cheering. helping. and

pushing her teammates. Squazzo's
ability to contribute to team spirit
and fulfill her individual athletic
potential has made her especially
valuable. Squazzo is quick to credit
Warner for her success.

"Coach Warner is a fantasitc
coach who has turned the team
around. She is well-liked and more
than a coach. She is a friend who
ltas been an inspiration to me and
helped me set my goals. She is one
person I never want to lose touch
With." Inspired by Warner’s exam-
ple Squazzo plans to coach one day
also. Whether it is at the university
or high school level. Peg will no
doubt be as successful as her coach.
Certain coaching qualities can't be

_‘&ught. Coach Warner has them;

and sodoes Squazzo. This quality is
the ability to put the human being
before the player.

Squazzo's contributions to
Albany don't stop here. In addition
to her dual athletic features. Squaz-
zo also plays intratnural soccer and
volleyball which she enjoys very
much. She also was the Albany
representative to the NYSAIAW
and is currently vice-president of
WIRA. Squazzo contributes to the
athletic department as well as learn-
ing there. Last year. she was a
teaching assistant for Warner's
basketball and tennis classes. This
year. Peg is a math education major
and a student teacher at a nearby
school. Her goal of becoming a
math teacher/coach is getting closer
everyday.

When all the points have been
scored, home runs hit, goals scored.
and spikes made. Squazzo will
move on following her dream of a
professional career. Certainly the
dedication and determination she
has exhibited as an athlete will serve
her well in ltcr future pursuits. D
