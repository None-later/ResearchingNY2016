Lin noteschanges in China

By Shellah Sable
smrr WRITER

Chinese women in tltc 18th and
19th centuries had very low status
and no first names. but that's
changing now, according to Alice
Lin, who described her observa-
tions and perceptions of China Sun-
day during an international tea.

Lin explained the direction
women‘s roles have taken in China
by citing examples of their lifestyles
in the past two hundred years. "A
woman had no first name." Lin re-
counted. “She was known to her
friends and relations as Mrs. so and
50. Her first nantc was not recogniz-
ed or used...shc had no'status...shc
was not educated at all itt an institu-
tion," said Lin.

The Chinese women of the early
centuries were' easily divorced by
their husbands for atty reason, said
Lin. "The primary reason was if the
woman bore no sons," ,‘ ' '
Lin, “but tto reason Itad to exist.
The tttttrrittgc could be terminated if
the husband decided to terminate
it." Women cottld ttot divorce at all
witltottl mutual cottscnt from thcir
husbands, nsscrtcd Lin, and
husbands could also have many
concuhines “under the law."

The sttbsct'victtcc ot' Chincsc
wontctt ill the pttsl bcgatt with train-
ittg when they were infants, Lin
mttitttaincd. “The Chinese woman
was taught l0.obcy all men, first her
husband, and then her son... A son
was awarded (his father’s) properly
over the mother in every case," ad-
ded Lin, and “a woman could ttot
inherit property or money."

A woman in China whose hus-
band dicd was expected to never
marry again or. “sometimes if site
committed suicide the action was
looked at in a positive way and she
would be applauded by her content-

porarics." notcd Lin.

In l9ll, the New Republic went
into action and it changed the role
of women in a gradual way, said
Lin. "The change wasn't drastic
because of China's size. The new
laws took a long time to reach all of
China," she explained.

The practice of having con-
cnbincs was outlawed under the
New Republic, said the speaker.

The l93l Civil Codes gave
women rights and protection equal
to those of Chinese men, said Lin.

Lin explained that in 1949 the
Communist Party in China was
*

“A woman could
not inherit
property. .”

helpful in raising the status of
women. “They wanted to arrange a
classless society so it was the women
that were appealed to because they
were oppressed...Thcy (the women)
assumed important roles in lite
development of Communist
China...Thcy worked side by side
with men and became group leaders
and politically attd socially active,"
observed Lin.

“The (recent) role models of
women in China were educated itt
Western countries and came back to
Cititta to set examples," said Lin.

Lin visited China in I979 and
I982.

Lin made three major observa-
tions about 1982 Citina. “There
was a larger number than ever
before of women in the labor
force," site explained, and “at large
ttutttbcr of women itt high public
positions... (There were) tttorc

Speaker criticizes U.S.
policies in Middle East

By Doug Weiss

President Ronald Reagan is using
“electoral politics" by moving the
Marines ottl of Lebanon and onto
ships, said SUNYA Political
Science Prol'cssor Nabch Khoury at
at spccclt Thursday night on U.S.
foreign policy in Lebanon.

liy retttoving lltc troops from
Lebanon, Reagan ttvoids “Iibcrttl
criticism" dcclttrcd Khoury. Shell~
ittg Beirut from the ships “avoids
conservative criticism", lte added.

ltt order to resolve conflict itt
Lebanon. all U.S. and foreign
forces ttntst hc rctnovcd frotn
Lebanon, Khoury emphasized.

Khoury said that the U.S. is

“playing it game" itt Lebanon, and '

that this “ ‘gttmc' is destruction."

In ttddition to recommending the
U.S. “extricate ilsclf frottt playing
this game" Khoury said that the
U.S. is using ti “cold war pcrspcc-
live" in their foreign policy.

Lebanese policy intcrtwincs three
major components, snid Khoury,
which are international, regional
and domestic in nature.

On the international level.
Khoury stressed the effects of
American "containment policy",
and its causing of the
"‘ntisuntlcrslnndiug of social and
political systems" in Lebanon. In-
sisliltg there are no leftist motives to
Lebanese goals, Khoury asserted
that the Lebanese do ttot desire any
form of socialist government.

Khoury noted United States'
"disinterest" in Lebanon during
the l960's and 1970‘s, and conclud-
cd that the U.S. did not recognize
any problems until the “crisis”
began during the l980's.

Khoury said that regional pro-
blems with Israel. Syria. and the

Palestinians arc "bargaining
chips," and asserted that these pro-
blems have “no bearing on the
emerging system of Lebanon."
Khoury emphasized that tile various
chttncsc political factions gain
tltcir importance by having equal
chances to voice their views in the
govcrtttttcnl.

“Rebuilding the Lebanese army
in I983 didn‘t help" the country, he
said, because “there must be a cott-
scnsus (between the interest groups)
of the army's military use." Khoury
said the tcrttt "civil war" is innp-
proprialc for the Lebanese conflict
because tlterc is “every conceivable
kind of soldier involved."

To facilitate change, anti ttdjnst
tltc Lebanese government to fit the
needs of the country. Khoury sug-
gestcd that the Lebanese govern-
tncttt should "sit down and address
their internal problems.“

According to Chair of the
SUNYA Political Science Depart-
ment Martin Edelman, “every ad-
ministration since Franklin
Roosevelt" has national interest.
Edelman emphasized this approach
to foreign policy. httt noted that the

Reagan administration has a"

“distinctive emphasis on force” in
their foreign policy. The Reagan
administration does not take the
long established Lebanese groups
into account, and it “doesn't havea
viable policy" he added.

The U.S. wants a pro-western
government at best. or it neutral one
'at worst. to rule Lebanon. accor-
ding to Edclman. "The PLO has it
past history of not accepting the ex-
islcncc of Israel" ltc said. Without
this acceptance of israel. the “PLO
will not make peace in Lebanon any
,casier," he said.

liberal types of maternity benefits
for working pregnant women,
which encouraged women to work
by making day care services for
their children common and depen;
dable. At the same time they cn-
,couraged one child per family
Ithrough the one child planning pro-
gram."

Currently women in China have
started to reach the degree of status
that all people should have, Lin
said. She noted, however, that this
is still only applicable to certain
women itt China. Site also observed
that "a woman in China is not able
to share the housework with her
husband like Western women. They
are still responsible for the shopp-
ing. laundry and running of the
home."

Lin lcl't Cltun King, China, in
I964. She attended Taiwan College.
received her masters in psychology

and social work frotn the University _

of Michigan. She spent ten years
'with the tncntal health department
and eventually returned to Colum»
bin University for her doctorate in

Social Policy and Planning,
rcporlcd Litt.
“My family, two yottttgcr

brothers and my parents, were very
supportive of my goals of Itighcr
education and carccr... This was
not true of my contcittporarics.”
she said.

jcct Management. explained that

ped people and she is involved with

‘ 'Crisis " began during I980 '3.
History Professor Lawrence Wil-
tttcr said “Reagan is indeed playing
electoral polili ‘ " ilc asserted that
“most Americans see no useful pur-
pose for U.S. troops itt Lebanon."
The U.S. does not want to appear
weak. according to Witlncr, and
weakness in the current administra-
tion is shown “by not fighting
wars," Itc said. In addition, the

 

US. is not sympathetic to the PLO,

and has no plan for dealing with
thctn “except to ignore them,“ he
shill.

“Reagan views all foreign policy
through the prism of cold war,"
»aid Witlttcr. ln viewing all things
as either beneficial to the U.S. or
Soviets. Reagan “misses the cont-
plexity of Middle East conflicts."

The major goal of Reagan policy
is preventing Middle Eastern oil
from falling to the Soviets. or any
others that “would deny the U.S.
oil," said Wiltner. Wiltner noted
that the U.S. is not playing lite role
of peaccmaker by becoming "a
belligerent." U.S. should not be ap-
plying pressure in Lebanon, and the
United Nations should “serve as the

peacekeepng role" he said. I E]
