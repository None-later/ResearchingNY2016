AbUse may be linked to hormone

By Barbara Barron

Infant abuse may belinkcd It)th
hormone testosterone, according to
the findings of SUNYA biological
psychologist Dr. Bruce B. Svare.

Using mice as research animals.
Svare said he has discovered tltat
the levels of the hormone
testosterone influence tltc behavior
of the adult mice towards infant
mice.

“Naive female animals, or
females that have not previously
been exposed to infants sltow spon-
taneous maternal instincts,“ he
said. adding that the females will
nurse and care for tltc young mice.
“Naive males, on the other hand,
react aggressively to the young and

try to kill them," he explained.

Svarc's research focuses on the
affects of hormone and gender dif-
fercnccs on behavior.

As part of his research, Svare
said, he castrated male mice in
order to eliminate the hormone
testosterone. “These male mice
then tend to act like the naive
females and even try to nurse the
young," he asserted. "0n the, other
ltand, females that were injected by
the hormone tend to act aggressive
toward the young," he said.

According to Svare, it is not
known if this type of behavior cxists
in humans. “I don't know of any
research that shows this
phenomenon in people," he said.

"There are other factors besides
physiological ones, like hormones,
that are involved, like experience,
cultural factors and family rclation-
ships," he maintained.

In lower animals their scnsc ot
smell is “refined and cxtremcly im-
portant," he said. thn
testosterone enters the brains of
lower animals it affects tltc olfttc~
tory bulb, or the sense of smell.
This somehow changes tltc way lltc
mouse perceives tltc baby, he said.
However, in higher animals. such as
humans, the sense of smell is less
important and "they are probably
affected to a lesser degrce titan the
lower animals," Svare said. l

STA Fl“ If 'It‘ITER

A group of Minnesota college students filed a
lawsuit with the United States Supreme Court last
week, challenging the constitutionality of the Solomon

Amendment.

The I982 law, sponsored by Representative Gerard
Solomon (R-Glens Falls) restricts students who fail to
rcgistcr for the draft from receiving federal aid for

education.

According to John Kostos, a spokesperson for
Solomon, the law is supportcd by an overwhelming
majority of American people and Congressmcn
although it is opposed by somc college students and of-

ficials.

Stttdcnt Association of tltc State UniversityiSASU)
President Jim Tierney called the law economically,
racially andscxually discrimimttory. Sincc females are
exempt front registration tltc law does not affCCI
thcm,hc noted. The law also sttggcsts that thosc who
don't need federal aid could avoid rcgistrarion, said-

Ticrncy.

Martin Edclman, Chairman of tire SUNYA Political
Sciencc dcpurtmenl, said that while he didn‘t tltink tltc ~
law was constitutional, tltc Supreme Court will pro-
bably decide in favor of the law because the majority
of the current court is not inclined to decide against

Lounge closed

Thc Humanities Lounge
(Humanities room 354) will con-
tinue to be closed afternoons
“unless faculty and students give
good reason to change" the
policy, said Dean of Humanities
Paul Wallace.

The lounge now enjoys "a lit-
tle bit of both worlds," explain-
ed Wallace. “It’s not closed as a
lounge," but open for lectures,
conferences, and poetry
readings, he maintained.

Wallace said he had heard of
petitions circulating to rc-open
the lounge, but added that only
one student had been in to speak
to him‘abou‘t the issue.

CROP fast

The 30~hour fast sponsored
last weekend by People and

The fast lasted from noon Fri-
day to 6 p.m. Saturday, and
Ribciro estimated that close to
240 students participated. “We

Thc new rules, which cttllcd

areas in each building but did

originally aroused concern
because some peeplc felt tltcy
were unenforceable.

hopefully Dippiklll will have elec-

' tricity in two years.

UAS board member and SA
Controller Adam Barsky said that
as part of the original proposal
UAS was to have given to Dippikill
the SI3.000 a year it currently
budgets for Glen House, but that
the UAS- Long-Range Planning
Committee had found that they
could not decide that, issue and so
had proposed only the sale of Glen
House.

Barsky said that SA and UAS
had been fulfilling the same func-
tion at Dippikill. “In this instance
we were competing against each
other," he said.

Dippikill “will never get the elec-
tricity without tltc $l3,000 a year,“
ltc maintained. He said he expects
the issue will comc up at tltc budgct
meeting in late March or curly
April.

Last year UAS offered Glcn
House to SA provided SA would
take over the operating costs of the
property.

Former SA President Mike Corso
said llltll thc UAS offer was refused
because tltc costs would have been
about $10,000 a year, which was
too much for SA to ltttndlc at tltc
time.

Corso said he would like to see it
remain owncd by UAS. “I'd lovc to
see it somehow sttty it part of tltc
University community."

He ttlso expressed fears that an

outside owncr might not be
beneficial to thc adinccnt Dippikill
Comp.

This concern was discussed ill the
board meeting, where it was dccid-
cd that since tltc ncttrcst major
roads were over tltrcc miles away
tltc Glen House propcrty was not
needed as a buffer for Dippikill.

Zahm said UAS is asking $50,0(X)
for tltc property, and will try to sell
it without a r-ztltor.

Clifton Park in Saratoga County.
will also be sold, although not
necessarily to the town of Clifton

possibility. "They’re not on the

According to SA Attorney Mark
Mishlcr, “On a basic lcvcl it is un~

tltc basis of sex. It is against tltc law
itt New York to discriminate on tltc

Misltlcr said that SUNYA may

ed that, “Once it‘s at goycrnmcnt in—

thought," Zahm said.

Zahm said that money raised
would be placed in a separate ac-
count from the general operating
funds and used for long range
capital projects.

Long Range Planning Committee
chair Nell Brown said that presently
no new programs are planned. “No

specific projects have been
authorized by the board," he
stated.

Brown said one possibility the
committee has been discussing is a
building on campus that might in-
cludc additional student recrea-
tional areas and an expanded
bookstore. A health club with
weight roonts and a sauna. and an
additional snack bar were also

possibilities, he said.

Brown said that no specific pro-
posals were being fortnulated by the
committee. "We have not honed in
on any directions we'd like to go."

One thing Brown said must be
taken into account is the 10cation of
the possible building. He noted that
SUNY-Buffalo's new bookstore
was located off the main campus
and was not even adjacent to a bus
stop.

Zahm said that one thing to be
taken into consideration is whether
or not UAS will be allowed to build
on state property.

Kosher kitchen discussed
The board also discussed tltc
amount of funds UAS should
allocate to subsidize tltc kosher kit-

chen on Dutch Quad. zahm said
that this year UAS would give the
kitchen $33-34,000.

The board approved a resolution
to reduce tltc subsidy to $25,000 for

- l985-86 and 86-87 school years,

Sarracco said.

Barsky said the vote. 7-6 with two
abstentions, may not be valid
because a two-thirds vote may be
necessary for approval.

He also said he voted against the
proposal because no limit on the
price of a kosher plan was specified.
“I felt there was nothing in thereto
protect the individual student."

Zahm said he thought that the
decision to support a subsidy was a
policy that had to be agreed on by
the board, but that he thought there
was a need for is kosher kitchen on

students last year.

“With that size enrollment it can
never generate enough income to be
self-sufficient," unless rates were to
be greatly increased. he said.

“There are a few students who
must have it.” Sarracco said. and
she added that since all students liv-
ing on campus must buy a. meal
plan, she believes UAS must run a
kosher kitchen for those who must
eat kosher foods.

Brown agreed, saying, “I see it as
very desircablc and necessary." The
service should be provided becttasc
otherwise students would have to
live off-campus attd also because
