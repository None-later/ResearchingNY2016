Drinking age proposals debated

notary public and be drafted." ’She
pointed out that the privilcdgc to
drink valcoholic beverages has
already been taken from 18-year-
olds who must assume other adult
responsibilities. This, said Gaislcr,
is selective prohibition.

The problems with selective pro-
hibition center on age discrimina-
tion. according to Gaisler. It is an
abuse of civil liberties to target one
small faction of the population, she
maintained.

The 21-year-old drinking age
would discriminate against people
under 2! who do not have licenses.
and women under 2i. who have
statistically provcn low accident
rules. Oaisler said.

“99.4 percent of those under
twenty-one have never been involv-
ed in an auto accident." Gaislcr
said. Education. rehabilitation and
strict enforcement of DWI laws is
thc solution to decreasing the
number of crashes, she stated.

Munch said that many studies
cited by those against raising thc
drinking age were out of context.
The presidential commission SCI up
to study this question wits compos-
cd of 36 organizations and hurt thc
licst available cxpcrtisc across the
country. “This group, which hiitl
no vested inlcrcst, like the Tiivcrn

Owners. votcd nntutimously to rziixc
the drinking ugc to ll.“ notcd
Munch.

"Drinkng is tiol a constitutional
right. Fttrtltcritttirc. a legal prccc-
dcni only‘nccds a rational‘logic in
order to be changed." he added. 28

2|. Raising the drinking age will not
stop drinking. btit it will reduce
availability. he explained. “Instead
of drinking in bars, young people
will be forced to drink in private
residences. which will hopefully cut
down on the number of crashes."
noted Munch.

alcohol abuse. He noted that the
unenforceability of a drinking age
law is evidenced by the futility of
prohibition and the difficulty of en-
l‘orcing anti-drug laws.
Wothcrspoon explained that it is
almost impossible to cnforcc legisla-
tion of social norms sittcc pcoplc
begin to drink in social scttings at
sixteen. llc ziddcd that liquor can he

obtained througlt parents. friends,
and fake proof. and that instead of
drinking in a licensed bar with
supervision. young people are forc-
ed to go "underground" with their
drinking.

To raise the drinking age is a
simplistic solution. stated Wothcrs-
poon. “It's treating the symptom
while ignoring the disease." he add-
cd.

During the rcbuttals. Boor
pointed out that bars sell only 24
percent of all alcoholic beverages.
He also noted that both supporters
had opponents of raising the drink-
iitg age. to be more favorable to
their own particular cause.

Munch said that education pro-
grams are a drop in the bucket com-
pared to the bombardment of li-
quor ads in the media. Multiple
programs must be used in conjunc-
tion with legislation to be effective.
he said.
