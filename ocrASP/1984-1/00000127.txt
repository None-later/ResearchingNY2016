(Catholichuth Organization). I would have
like to have played more. but you can't argue
with a l7-3 rec'ord." .

There are no post-season tournaments for

junior varsity teams; at the end of the season.
the Danes' thoughts will be on next year and
what it will have in store for them. Only one
player from varsity is graduating (starting
forward Wilson Thomas), so there won’t be
many open spots on the roster. Two players
that have the best chances of making varsity
are Corley and Chapman.
' “Duane took a big step from high school
to college this year," said Boland. “Things
he did and moves he made last year just don't
work in college-level basketball. Duane's
really come along. but he still has to improve
to help out varsity."

Corley has had some trouble guarding big
guards; in the second Union game, a bigger
Ken Levine gave Corley fits in the second
half. "Duane's learned to be a little more
physical," said Boland. “He still has to han-
die big guards down low, and to do that he’s
got to get tough -— like Dan Croutier. l'd say
that Duane's got as good as a shot as
anybody on the team.”

Of all the big men on the Danes, Chapman
has shown the most consistency of tltem all.
“Rich doesn’t like losing, and he plays that
way,” said Walton. “He's a tough kid."

The man whose opinion counts the most is
Dick Sauers, Head Coach of Albany’s varsity
team. Said Sauers, “i like Rich. He comes
from a good, tough program and he's a good
competitor who wants to play. He’s also not
afraid of contact, which is an admirable
quality in a player."

Two players that also have solid chances of
making varsity arc O‘Connell and Oliver.
Both players have to improve their work
habits, according to both Boland and Snuers.

“Andy needs to be more intense and he‘s
got to work harder in practice," said Boland.
“To his credit, he gave it his all when he was
in tlte games. He’s a good shooter that might
be able to help varsity.“

Oliver has always been a threat to score,

TUESDA Y, MARCH 6, 1984 D ALBANY STUDENTPRESS 

The year in review: JV Danes finish" with 17-3 recOrd

and his defensive play has been improving:
Still, there are some doublts about Oliver.
“He’s got a lot of natural ability, but he's got
to push himself harder," said Boland. “He
should play with more intensity. because
sometimes it seems that he‘s just going
through the motions."

As a 6’2" forward, Oliver will have to ad-
just his game to the shooting guard position.

Incoming transfer students or perhaps even
an outstanding freshman might take spots
away from this year's j.v. team. The players
that don't make varsity can be proud that
they were a part of an outstanding team.

IRIM SHOTS: Oliver led the tesrit with an
avenge of 15.5 points and five rebounds.

Coriey averaged 12.9 points and shot 13 per-
cent from the line. Chapman and O'Connell
each avenged 11.9 points. O'Connell allot I
team-high 76 percent from the Inc and Clap-
man pulled down nine rebounds s
game...‘l‘lte learn avenged 72.3 points a
game and held their opponents to 61.9 points
a game. El

 

“lf Curtis wants to be the two-man, he'll
have to work on his ballhandllng," said
Boland. "He’s going to'have to work hard
over the summer if he wants to make varsity.
but he’s got a good shot."

Guards Mick Fabozzi, Scott Jankes and
Storey will have a hard time making varsity;
the varsity squad doesn't need anymore .
guards. All three players were indispensible
to the j.v. team this year.

Fabozzi didn't come out for the team until
the second semester, so he never had a chance
to get rolling. "i feel sorry that the season’s
over," said Boland. “Just when he's starting
to play well. the games run out on him."

“Scott is the type of player that helps the
team in ways that don’t show up in the box-
score," said Boland. “when him and Freeze
were in the game, we played a good defensive
game.”

Storey started the last seven games and did
an excellent job replacing O'Connell.
“Freeze improved quite a bit this year." said
Boland. “He learned to use his quickness as
an asset instead of a detriment. Freeze has to
learn to throw a pass with some touch, rather
than drilling it all the time."

Forwards .lohn Gore. Ray LaChancc and
Mann and centers Scott Ncumun and
Sweeney will probably be thinking two years
down the road. Tltcy always give their best
efforts, bttt next year‘s varsity doesn't have
that many openings.

“They're all good team players that never
complained," said Boland. "Everyone
Icouldn't play all the time. but when these
guys played, they hustled. They're good ad<
ditions to any team."

There’s no guarantee that any player on
