Lopiano‘to holci softball clinic

ESXOCMM TE SPORTS EDITOR -

Former softball great, Donna Lo-
plano, an inductee to the National
Softball Hall of Fame, will be con-
ducting a pitching and hitting clinic
in the UniVersity Gym, this Sunday
morning, March ilth.

The 36-year old Loplano, who
compiled a 13" . Ditching won-
Ioss rc'cord'wh he played in the
Class A softball .eagne, will discuss
the basics of fast-pitch softball,
mainly hitting and pitching. The
clinic will begin at 10 AM and con-
cludc at 5 PM.

Over i50 high school and college
coaches from the Eastern region
will attend and still more are ex-
pected. Albany State students are
also urged to attend at a special five
dollar discount rate.

Besides the clinic serving to
enlighten coaches on techniques
and theories, Albany State softball
coach Lee 'Rhenish, who has
organized the event, hopes to raise
enough money from the proceeds
for the school to buy an electric
scoreboard for the softball ﬁeld and '
install a permanent fence around
the outﬁeld.

Lopiano, who retired from com-
petitive softball in 1978. is now
Director of intercollegiate Athletics
for women at the University of
Texas at Austin. Her career ac-
complishments enabled her to be in-
ducted into the National Softball
Hall of Fame in Oklahoma in i983.
Thus far 78 players have received
such an honor- 46 men and 32
women.

“She (Lopiano) is more qualified
than any other clinician in the coun-
try". for softball," said coach
Rhenish, who has known Lopiano
since the 1960’s. “Many men
coaches know a lot about softball,
but when it comes to teaching it,
theyJ can't break it down to the
basics." -

Born in Brooklyn. Lopiano's
softball achievements on the field
are just as prestigious as her
teaching ability:

.she was the youngest player ever
to be chosen as a softball All-
American (l6).

oin her ten years with the
Raybcstos Brakettes (1963-1973),
she led them to nine National
Championships and nine All-
Atneriean honors at four dil'l‘crcnl
positions. ‘

OAS a pitcher, she compiled a
153-18 pitching won-loss record,
15-2 in National Championship
play.

“She's a teacher's teacher and a
coach's coach." said Rhenish. “i
think one of the problems of soft-
ball on the high school and college
level is the coaches don't know how

 

to teach the sport. These clinics are
helpful in teaching coaches how to
leach as well as informing the
players themselves."

Registration forms for SUNYA
students are available through
WiRA and AMiA; fee is $5.00. ill

experience at ECA C meet »

By Jim Emln ,

The Albany State women's in-
door track team travelled to
Bates College in Maine with only
five members to participate in
the ECAC Women's indoor
Track and Field Championships
this past weekend. The Dane
squad was limited because of ex-
tremer tough qualifying marks
needed to participate in the
meet. The Danes that did par-
ticipate failed to score in any
event, despite most members
posting personal bests.

Karen Kurthy posted an ex-
cellent time of 5102.6 in the
[SOD-meter run, setting an in-
door school record. Her time
was also a personal best for both
indoor and outdoor track.

Both Mary Carmody and

.she was still far from placing in
‘ this highly competitive meet.

solid time of i:32.2 while Car-
mody ran a very fast l:30.7 for a
personal best in the event.

Bette Dzamba may have run
the best meet of her life, setting
personal bests in both events of a
grueling SOOO-meter. 3000~meter

in the woo-meter run and
19:08.0 in the sow-meter run
