For Albany. several stellar per-

Although no other Albany swim-

Since up to thirty swimmers may
qualify for a single event, a finish in
the top six is quite good, and a rib-

bonsignifying a 12th place finish or,

better is also cherished.

Jeff Ball became the fourth and
ﬁnal Dane to finish in the top
twelve in all three of his events,
when he took 7th place in the

Other swimmers such as Frank
Cawley, Fred Greenbaum, Torn

bons in various events. Albany also
performed surprisingly well in the
relay events.

nedy, Ober. Greenbaum. and Bill

"program. “We’ve had one heck ofa

The Albany State Racquetball
Club qualified for the nationals

at Binghamton on Sunday.

The team was led by freshman
Garret- Thompson who shunned
a scholarship offer from Wichita
State, placed second. Thompson
is the only member of the Danes
that will‘be eligible for the first
flite competition. Thompson
was defeated in the finals of the
states by a senior from the
hosting Binghamton after winn-
ing three matches.

According to Thompson, the

States were the club's first com-

» petition, and he expects big im-

JV Danes ‘1 7-3, com

By Dean Chan
EDITORIAL ASSISTAN

Head Coach Jim Boland had one goal for
the Albany State men's junior varsity basket-
ball team; if he could get his players ready for
varsity, his job would be done. After a 17-3
season, it seems that Boland got more than
he asked for.

The year began with the Schenectady Com-
munity College tournament. The Danes
defeated Albany Pharmacy to reach the
ﬁnals, where they met Schenectady CC.
Albany fell behind by as many as 17 in the se-
cond half. but rallied to defeat Schenectady,
62-60. Tltat tournament provided a sample of
what was forthcoming in the games ahead;
the Danes were a talented team that wouldn't
quit tllld above all, would find a way to win.

Albany reeled off eight consecutive wins
before dropping a pair to the Junior College
ofAlbany. “We weren’t ready for the second
JCA game," said Boland. “Wejust got back
from vacation and we didn’t get enough
practices in. Still, we should have won at least
one of them."

The second JCA game marked the last

game that former co-captain Chris Jones
would play. Jones was tlte team's leading
scorer and the strongest inside player the
Danes had. Unfortunately, he was declared
-- ' ’ “, ' ",f" for the r ' '
the season. “Chris was our best player when
he left.” said Boland. “There wasn’t tnuch
that he did wrong. The team movcd faster
with ltim on the court, and it was easier to gct
the ball inside. We really missed him."

Jones’ departure left a void inside that ltttrl
the Danes, especially when they needed it
basket down low. “We didn’t get the ball in-
side enough when Chris left,” said Boland.
“He used to come out hard and demand the

ball. No one else did that."

The second loss to JCA was noteworthy

I for another reason: Rich Chapman returned
to form. Chapman got cut from varsity
earlier in the year and decided to get away
from basketball for a little while. He made
‘his debut in the Danes’ eighth game, bill it
wasn‘t until the second JCA loss (his third

1 game back) that Chapman made his presence
I felt. Hc grabbed 10 rebounds in a strong per-

of

formance that indicated that he would be the
man to replace Jones.

After a 30-point romp against RPl, the
Danes took to the road and faced College of
St. Rose’s varsity squad. This game establish-
cd Chapman as the Danes' only bonafide in-
side piayer. He scored 20 points. snared 11
rebounds and blocked five shots in the 82-66
victory. "Rich definitely took up the slack as
our inside player and as a leader on the
tcam." said Boland. “He hits the boards so
well; without him. we would have been in
deep trouble."

One thing that the Danes were guilty of
was inconsistency. There would be games
when an observer might wonder if ltc were
watching the varsity team by mistake. And
then there were titncs when that observer left
for want of a better game, perhaps at the
YWCA. The second gatnc against RPl would
be one of several games that would have
made the observer leave.

RPI's junior varsity team would be hard-
prcssed to defeat a good intramural team. it
wouldn’t take any effort for Albany to beat
RP! and the second RPi game proved it. The
Danes sleepwalked their way to a lethargic
20-point victory, a game that should embar-
rass tltc players just by being associated with
it. The victory did have one bright spot: Cur-
tis Oliver.

“Curtis seemed to be the only guy who
came ready to play." said Bolund. Oliver
scored 26 points and pulled down nine rc-
bounds in an excellent performance. The
game appeared to boost Oliver's confidence.
as he began to get more involved on offense
lit the next few games. The Dunes' next oppo-
ncttt was Union. Oliver connected for 17
points. but more importantly, carried the
team down the stretch. With three minutes
1ch to play and the Danes up by only three,
Oliver stole the show. He scored six straight

points, four of them foul shots. to seal the
victory over the Dutchmen.

Albany's next game against New Paltz. as
well as their previous game against Union.
demonstrated how well the Danes can play
when they play like a team. Good teams seem
to bring out the best in the Danes. and New
Paltz was certainly a good team. Albany got
solid play from Chapman, Oliver, and guards
Duane Corlcy and Freeze Storey to defeat the

 

 

 

 

 

Hawks. 80-74. But once again, it was Oliver
who took control of the game in the last three
minutes. With the score 66-65, Oliver scored
eight straight points (six of them from the
line) and 10 of the team's last 14 points to
capture the victory.

The New Paltz victory was the first game
for the Danes without shooting guard Andy
O'Connell. O'Connell left the team for per-
sonal reasons. With O’Connell gone, Albany
found themselves without a true outside
shooter. “When he hit those outside shots.
we were very tough to beat." said Boland.
“We missed him.”

The Danes now had a new look to their of-
fense. in the early part of the season, the
team was a fast-breaking team that could

 

 

pile best record in 10 years

' game, starring Corley, Oliver and Storey.
Bolund had so much confidence in their stall
that he used it with more than 12 minutes to
play in the game. Corley is the man who
makes it all work. “Duane look big strides to
becoming a leader," said Boland. “As the
year went on. Duane realized that he didn’t
have to score 20 points to lead our team. His
job was to set up the offense and to work the
ball around. He's really progressed this
year."

if one can find fault with the Dane of-
fense. it would probably be the lack of pa-
tience against zone defenses. “We rellcd too
much on the jutnpcrs against the zone,” said
Boland.“lnstcztd of being patient and look-
ing for the good sltot, we would rttsh our
shots off." This impatience was shown in the
Danes' last game of the year against Hudson
Valley CC.

Albany's impatience doesn't always have
negative results; when the shots are failing,
the Danes will win despite their impatience.
But when they're not firing, the Danes look
awful.

Hudson Valley held a 15-point bulge after
the opening minutes of the second .half.
_Albany then played the best 15 minutes of
baskctball that you could ever expect to see
from a junior varsity team. “We looked like
a team out there." said Bolnnd. “When i
brought guys in off the bench, they ﬁlled in
‘well. We pretty much did what we wanted to
against Hudson Valley." The Danes came up
a basket short that game. which left them one
win short of 1974's record of 18-2.

The Albany press shook up HVCC during

,thc second half, causing turnovers every

score in almost illl)’ manner. When .loncs
left. the Danes began to rely on tile jumper.

, But without O'Connell. the emphasis on of-
. t‘cttsc went ittsidc to Chapman and Oliver.

The following gttttlc against Onconta
underlined tltc change; Chapman scored 25
and Oliver hit for 2t as tlte Dunes bout the
Red Dragons. 69-62.

Albany was a lt.‘ilm of streaks throughout
tltc year. Tllc Dunes had two eight-game win-
ning streaks sandwiched around a two-game
losing streak. Against Hamilton. the team's
16th win, Albany was stt'caky on the court.
The Danes played horribly for the first 14
minutes of the game, but then ran off 11
straight points to take an eight-point halftime
lead. in the opening minutes of the second
half, the Danes outscored Hamilton 10-2 to
put the game away. But aside from those
streaks, Albany did not play a good game.
“We had a few had spells durittg the year,"
said Boland. “For tltc most part though. we
did play like a team.“

When the Danes played like a team. no op-
poncnt was safe. Albany always seemed to
save their best efforts for Union; the first
game was it dogfight until the last few
minutes. The rematch. which was played at
Union. was not to be believed. During the
last 14 minutes of the game, neither team
held a lead of more than one basket. The
game was won by Oliver's 20-footcr with on-
ly two seconds left. He scored 21 of the

' Danes' 51 points.

The Union game featured the Albany delay

 

 

 

other time HVCC had the ball. The full-court
press is something that the Danes used effec-
tively front Day 1. "We've had good success
with the press because we have quick and
smart players," said Boland. “Our back men
- Chris. Rich and Kevin (Mann) were all good
at anticipating the pass. We tried to make the
other team make mistakes." ‘
When a team has a successful season,
credit has to be given to the players and the
coaches. Roland and Assistant Coach Kurt
Walton were praised by the team as coaches

‘ that knew what they were doing. Said reserve

center O.T. Sweeney, “i learned more this
year, both from competition and coaching.
than i learned in all my years with the CYO
