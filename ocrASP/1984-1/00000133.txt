SAquestioned on funding of conference trip

By Ian Clemente
EDlmRIAL ASSISTANT

Off-Campus Representative Dave Silk
criticized Student Association's financing of

a trip made to a nationwide student voter
registration drive by three ASP editors, say-
ing that the ASE and SA “should not leave
themselves open to charges of bribery." The
ASP Corporation does not receive SA fun-
ding for publication.

The total SA funding of Central
the trip was $250, paid to c 1
Editor-in-Chief David L.L.

Laskin. The other two 

editors who went to the conference were
News Editor Steve Fox and Associate News
Editor Jerry Campione. The conference was
held at Harvard University February ii and
12 and was attended by student leaders and
editors from universities acrosss the nation.

Silk expressed "personal disgust" at the
funding, and called it "immoral." He
especially noted the conﬂict with the ASP en-
dorsement of SA of ﬁcials and SA funding a

 

central Council meeting

 
 

tri .

SA President Rich Schaf fer, who agreed to
allow the funds to be used by the editors,
defended his action by claiming that the ASP
brought back ittformalion which would help
SA's voter registration efforts. The funds us-
ed to send the ASP was “money spent
wisely," he said.

Laskln later said that the ASP editors were
able to attend meetings' at the conference
which were open only to members of the
press, including sessions with Jesse Jackson
and consumer advocate Ralph Nader.

“Members of the ASP are also Albany
students." Laskin later asserted, adding,
“We pay our student activity fee and we are
entitled to enjoy the beneﬁts of this just like
any one else. We went as studcttl represen-
tatives as well as student journalists.”

After the meeting, Sehaffer emphasized
that all payments were made directly to
Laskin and not to the ASP. The editors were
sent as representatives of the SA president.

he added.

According to Schafl’er, the allegation of
bribery was made because of the upcoming
SA elections. He said that the campaign was
veering toward mudslinging and that he
would run on his record, which he considers
“good... .

The issue developed because a bill was
brought to Council whiclt proposed that
funds be appropriated from SA's Emergency
Spending Line and deposited into a line
which pays for conference expenses.

The Conferences linc remains in the red,
bccause the bill was sent back to committee,
and therefore, no funds were diverted to the
Conferences line.

internal Affairs chair Ncil Shapiro
disagreed with the decision to fund the ASP's
trip. He implied that other SA represen-
tatives could have attended the conference
when he said, “There are other people in SA
besides Rich Schaffer and Steve Gawley,"
who origittniiy planned to tttlcnd the con-
l'ercnce.

Shapiro urged Cottncil to vote against the.
bill. “They went tltcrc us press,“ he claimed.

Silk said he ttgtccd with Shapiro. He said
that the Conferences line should go in the red
to show fttturc budget cotttmittccs how tnttclt
money was spent. This wottld aid the com—
ntittccs in their decision of funding for the
Conferences line.

After tltc Council scssiott Silk fttrtltcr cx-
pittincti ltis vicw, “Anytimc the Student
Association gives money to the ASP, which
constantly claims its financial
indcpcndcncc,wc lcttvc ottrsclvcs opctt to
chargcs of bribery.“

“i wasn't implying that Ric|t(SchttI'fcr) was
trying to bribe lIit.‘ rISI’,SitId Silk,“bul i think
he look it that l was making that churgc."

A bill which would rctiuirc tltc SA l’rcsi~
dcttt to inform Council at least one week itt
‘advancc of an allocation from the Con-
_- fcrcnccs line was passed by unanimous cott~

sent.

The election of ti vice chair to replace liar-
bara i-iurwitz, who rcsigncd last week, was
postpottcd until the next Council meeting.

The postponement was tnttttc because it ap.
peared that no vice-chair nomincc could
garner the twenty votes necessary itt order to
win the election.‘

There were four nominees and font ballots
in the voting for a vice chair. The initial
nominees were Silk and Alumni Quad
representative Steve Russo.

Colonial Quad representative Nancy
Killian nominated Silk. Stttlc Quad represen-
tative Steve Gawlcy nominated Russo.

Before the first ballot the candidates were
allowed to announce tltcir qualifications and
to answer question posed by Council
representatives.

Both Russo and Silk slrcsscd their will.
ingncss to work with Council‘s cotutnittccr
and the importance of ttnity itt t'ouncil.

in order to win the election, onc candidate
would have to rcccivc two-thirds the supth
of the total Council tlictnhcrsltip, twenty
votes.

Barber'enio‘ys work and students

By Lisa Strain

CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

Despite a less than ideal location
in the dismal tunnels of SUNYA
Dan Gattohthe UnivcrsityyBarber-
shop proprietor always manages to
greet his customers with a smile.

His shop is small, with two
barbcrs chairs, light blue walls and
a television in the

corner where a Fnday
customer can .

watch “General 
Hospital” while

getting a quick haircut. it has
facilities for services ranging from
beard trims and sitaves to a layer
cut complete with conditioning and
blow drying.

Gallo has been with the shop
since it opened in January 1967.
The store is owned by University
Auxiliary Services (UAS) and until
1974 was located iii the Campus
Center across from tltc bookstore,
according to Gallo.

“Tltc reason why we moved was
that in those days, just ttboul cvcry
ctttnpus ill the cottntry was ptttlittg
in food co-ops," Gallo said. “I
tried to make them understand that
the location was too small for
them" bccausc'of lhc nttmbcr of
customers thcy would receive, Cat-
to explained. “it was ideal for a
barber shop — you only get one or
two customers at a time."

in January 1975 the barber shop
moved to its present location, the
tunnels beneath the Social Sciences
building. The move did affect
business at first, Gatto said,
because "we were exposed at
the Campus Center. We had to cut
from three operations to two.” The
shop is run by Gallo and Don Mag-
gio, the other operator.

A mixture of students and faculty
frequent the shop, Gauo said.
“Last time we broke it down it was
60 percent students and 40 percent
faculty and staff,” he said. “We get
a lot of students —— they conte in
bunches," he added.

Convenience could be cited as a
major advantage of the shop
becattsc as Gallo said, “All the han-
dicapped students appreciate hav-
ing a shop here. They all cotnc to
us, each and every one."

Foreign students also regularly
frequent the shop, according to
Gallo. “Since they live on campus
they don't know where to go. \Vc
meet a lot of students from all over
students from the Middle East
ttnd a few years ago some Russian
students came in. i ask them about
thcir climate, their country, sports.
but never about politics." Gallo
said.

“A few, not tt lot" of wontcn
come in. said Gallo. He said at one
time tltcrc was a bcauty parlor next
to the barber shop ill the Campus

University Barber Don Gatto

Center, when it first opened. The
beauty parlor closed after a few
years. One reason, Gallo said, may
have been that “for a woman it
takes a lot longer titan a man. A
women's haircut could take an
hour, a man's 15 tninutes. Students
may miss a class, some women may
be late for work." Gatto explained.

The shop advertises in several
ways to bring customers in to its
somewhat unexposed location, Cat-
to said. “At one time we posted
signs up at the check cashing win-
dow, but they don’t stay up long.
We advertise in the new revolving
sign in the Campus Center now
too." He added,“Thc best adver-
tisement is word of mouth — if a
guy is happy with his haircut. he‘ll
tell his roommate, and then he’ll
come in." .

The best aspects of working at
lite University Barber Shop for Gal-
lo are “working with the sludcttts,
younger people, when you work
with college studettts and professors
you have a better surrounding, of
educated people. You're bound to
learn something (you might) not in
an ordinary shop," he said. “Those
three points — students, foreign
people and cducatcd pcopic makes
it very interesting," he added.

The average business is about 15
customers a day, Gallo said,
although “just before students go
home for tile holidays we get mobb-
cd. Tltcy also come itt right before
Parcnts‘ Day and wc get a lot of
scniors in tile month of May."

“If we can get a freshman to
cotnc in and hc likcs our service,

hc'll cotnc to us for four years,”
Gallo said. This seems" to be the
case for one student, an ROTC stu-
dcnt and senior‘ at SUNYA, who
has been frequenting tltc shop since
his freshman year.

“it's convenient and thc Itaircut's
exactly wltat I need for ROTC," the
student said. “it can‘t touch the
cars, and it must be slightly tapcrcd
— i tell them what I need." Com-
menting on Gallo, he smiled and
said, "i like him —- he's very polite.
iwouidn‘t come here il‘l didn‘t like
him."

Last Monday was the first time
Malt Epstein had ever been to the
shop. “it was convenient and thc
barbcrs scented competent." Eps-
tein explained. “it‘s an asset to the
University because they have com-
petent barbers where people can go
that‘s right on campus." he added.

The shop is opctt from Monday
throttglt Friday, 8 am — 5 pm.
Prices run from $5 for a regular
itaircttt to $8.50 for a layer cut wilit
styling, conditioner and biowdry.
"We try to keep ottr prices down,"
Gallo said. Even when prices at sur-
rounding haircutters near the
school go up, Gallo sttid, “UAS
tells its to keep prices down for
another year."

“I Iltink stutlcnts ttrc great,“
(iatto said. “We went through a
bad time in thc ‘7t)‘s witcn tltc
students didn't care — tltcir attitude
was ‘I don‘t give tt dumn.‘ littt now
lhcy'rc itttclligcttt and they go ottt
of their way to please you. We get
no complaints from thctn." ltc said
with it smile. ‘
