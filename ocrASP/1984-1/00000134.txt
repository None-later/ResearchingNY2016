Barsky. speaking after the meeting. com-
plained that not enough discussion was

allowed on the rate increase at Wednesday‘s

meeting. The issue. he said. had been tabled
at last Friday‘s meeting so that member's
would have tlnte to discuss the proposal.
"There was no discussion on it this morning.
there was no discussion on it beforehand."
he said.

"On tlte lloard you have a lot of respon-
sibility to tire corporation...but we are also
here to represent the students arid the
students' interests." Barsky said.

Barsky said lte blatned tlte Board's sttrdent
leaders because tltey did not call any sort of
student metnber meeting to discttss tlte issue.

UAS President Johanna Sarracco said that
site was available during tlte recess between
tlte meetings to discttss tlte proposal bttt tltat
no one approached her. "What does he ex-
pect. us to go attd beg hint?" site asked.

Board chair Marc Gitnpel said of the stu-
dent members‘concerns. “they were never
brotrgitt to my attention. I wislt they were."

Other lloard tttetttbers commented on the
raise saying tltcy felt it was necessary.

University Accountant anti Board member
Jim Van Voorst said that after Zalrnr went
over the ﬁgures at the first lloard meeting he
felt the increase was necessary. “i felt that l

Russo defended their action. "We both
want this position attd we want it bad." he
asserted. it “as important to compromise, he
said.

In other business. a bill that would require
Council to approve the use of SA's audio-
visual equipment was passed by unanimous
consent. Council can override the SA vice
president‘s plans to use the equipment by a
two-thirds vote.

The issue that sparked the bill. was the re-
cent use of SA-AV by two SA groups \\hich
staged events at Page Hall.

According to many Council members, they
believed that the use ot‘SA-AV was "fro/en"
because it was in the process of being sold.

Schneider said he granted the use oi' the
equipment to the International Student
Association arid the Chinese Student Associ-
tiott because it would save the groups money
and tltcre was little chattce of damage to the
equipment.

Several (‘ouncil members asked it' there
was an ol'l'icial policy for the use of the equip-
mettt. Schneider said there “as none. This
cottld cause problems because other groups
Irate asked to use the equiphtent and rtray be
denied. noted some Council members.

The resignation of Colonial Quad
representative l-‘r'ances Concepcion was an—
nounced at the session llcr resignation “as
"due to the t‘act that i lune moted and cart-
not represent the students on (,‘olonial
Quad." she stated.

('ottttcil \oted to appropriate $155 for
Middle Far-tit. Tire group claimed that it
needed the money itt order to maintain some

for it."

Associate Vice President for Health Ser-
vices and Board member Neil Brown agreed

that Zahm had adequately explained all the
reasons for the increase. “in my opinion the
Board acted responsibly.” he said.

Off-Campus Housing Director artd Board
member Karleen Karlson agreed with llarsky.
saying ”‘ “ ' not hate enough tittte to
discus ill , v) tsctl increase.

Site also d ' 'd that each member had to
make their own decsiorr on the proposal. “i
don‘t think you're a had student rtrernber for
voting for the increase." \ill.‘ maintained.

Barsky questioned the need for a raise at
this time. “They're cttttirtg costs. their opera-
tiotts have been successful." he said.
although he adtttittcd “the tttility eltarge was
justiﬁed." He said he thought the entire idea
of a utility charge was “bogus. all it is is the
State‘s way of getting more money from the
students."

Itarsky sated his harshest criticism for stu-
dent lloard members. “These students l'aiied
to argue about it or conl'er about it...who are
they representing? They‘re representing the
students - and the) i'ailcd the students."

A 2.4 to 4 percent increase would ltave
bccrt reasonable. liar‘sk) argued. becatrsc that
would cover the cost of the power bill.

(iitnpel said he l'elt the ﬁgures were as ac»
curate as possible, arid that labor "was not
pulling any tricks."
