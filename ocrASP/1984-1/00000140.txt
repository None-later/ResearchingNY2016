rcemphssizc our need for on-
campus housing.” he said.

When asked whether there was
enough on-campus housing at
SUNYA Welch said that students
aren’t usually pushed off campus,
“most people who live oil-campus
do so because they want to." he
said. But. he added. "deal hous-
ing market in the city of Albany is
light.“

About the possibility of any deci-
sion on additional construction of
campus housing Wclch suid.-"l
doubt that [bore will be any out
come from I! within a year.“

Students have lived at the Well-
ington since I975 when the city
bought the structure that was
bankrupt. “The city has funded a
deficit for the past two years," at
IIIL‘ hotel said Mayor Whaicn.
Whalch said last Dcccmbcr that the
Hotel ran $144,000 in the red dur-
ing the l981-82 year.

With the Wellington going there
are fears that the Wellington bus
scryicc may also and according to
Wclch the issue would have to be
looked at. Iiul. hc suid. "‘Why
would you run It scrvicc if no
students lived in the Wellington?
The answer is: we wouldn‘t; it goes
well beyond any obligation that the
university has." he said.

SA President Rich Schai'ler con-
tends lqu the reputation ol‘ the
Icgislulivc inlcrnship program for
students at lhc ol'l‘iccs downtown is
onc good reason that the service
should hc conlinucd. '
