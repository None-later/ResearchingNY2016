 soccer team

The Albany State indoor Soccer
lub notched their firstlwin of the
car last Saturday, as they finished
head of IO teamms in a tourna-

format pitted Albany against
Marist. a strong Division I team.
"They didn't come out as strongly
as i thought they would," said
defenseman Carl loos. "We came
out a little cold. but we had our
chances in front of the net.“ Marist
defeated Albany by a tight score of
3-l.

After beating a split RPl squad
2-0, Albany destroyed Skidmorc.
9-0. First-year player Jerry lsaacs
scored five goals while Scott Cohen
put in three. “Jerry is a fantastic
addition to our team." said head
coach Bill Schicl‘felin. I‘He'll really
help its in the fall." '

The victory put Albany in the
semifinals against Clarkson. A
mistake tnade before the game even
started almost cost Albany the
match. “We took the wrong end of
the court." said Schiel‘felin. Our
goalie (Patti Rector) had to deal
with the light glaring right in front
of him. He lost-a ball because of
that. and they 'got a goal.”

With only three minutes left.
Terry Bacchus unleashed a blister-
ing shot from midfield that tied the
s‘ot‘e. The rest of the filial period
a tscorelcss. as did the first over-
tgzi: period. .Soccer fans will tell
you tltat normal procedure dictates

a shootout to determine :1 Victor.
Well. they won't believe this otte.

The game went into a second
overtime period with one catch: the
goaltenders were removed. “That's
not soccer." said loos. "It you‘re in
the semifinals, you‘ve obviously
done something good to get there. I
would rather play another conven-
tional overtime period to see who
wins. This is a cheap way of winn-
ing."

Albany survived a scare when a
Clarkson player missed an open net
that would have won the game.
Albany gained control, as Bacchus
passed the ball frotn tnideourt over
to loos, who was standing to the
side. .

"Without a goalie, it‘s so easy to
score," said loos. “i hit it high at
the goal while Jerry screened the
guy who was defending the goal.
That guy had no choice: he had to
hit the ball with his hands."

Albany was awarded a penalty
shot. and Bacchus put it in for the
victory. The win gave Albatty a
chance to gain revenge against
Marist, who defeated Union iii the
other semifinal thatch, 3»2.

Mat'ist's main offensive threat
was Wayne (‘argilL who notched
two goals in the first game. it"
Albany wanted to beat Mat'ist. they
would have to stop (‘argilL ('ltalk
one up for the defense.

“Carl and 'l‘crt‘y did a great job
marking on defense." said Scltiel‘-
l'elint “.lct'ry slipped the ball
underneath their goalie for a goal.
and thanks our defense, that's all
we needed“. ‘

(i "l thinlt‘we nee improvement in
‘ all of our positions." said Sellers.
“We are working on some players
; that can fill our needs. There is no
‘ job security out there.”

One plttyer that promises to be a
strong addition to next year's squad
is Fields Blanchard. who transl‘er-
red from Hudson Valley Communi-
ty College.

"Fields has got great athletic
ability.“ said Sauers. “He could be

, a factor ottt there.

"He's good at a wide open game.
It‘s when it‘s bang. crash and work
like hell to get a good shot and get a
basket that counts. i think he has

' the ability to be one of the greatest
players we have ever had."

Another thing in the Danes'
favor next year is the Europe fac-
tor. ()n March 19 they will travel
abroad to play. The last time an

titer of I980) metsetts. the next

lll)()l'-I.A: As an interesting foot-
note. the llattes' opponents hit
almost as many foul shots as the
Danes took. The Danes made .107
