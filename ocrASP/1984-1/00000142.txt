The Albany State women‘s
basketball team accomplished near-
ly everything they set out to do dur-
ing the 1983-84 season. The women
cngcrs defended the Capital District
Tournament by defeating RP] and
the College of St. Rose. The team
teccchd a bid to the ECAC tourney
and also participated in the in-
augural SUNYAC playotls. And to
finish out the year with a respec-
table 15-10 record further showed

Albany Head Coach Mari Warner.
“The competition was a lot tougher
this year for us. We went up against
teams we have never played before
and did vcry'well.”

The Dunes began the year on at
positive note when they downed the
College of St. Rose. 65-54. Two
consecutive losses followed to RH
and Onconta. and left the team
disillusioned as to which direction
they were heading for in the year.
The next gamc against ()swcgo
might have been tltc tttrning point
for Albany. The Danes topped the
Lakers 66-53 and headed into the
Mttnhattanville Tournament with it
2-2 record.

Warner said, “The game against
Oswcgo really helped us out. We
came back from two losses anti
played beautifully."

The game against Union was the

Albany was a bit sluggish. and bow-

put the Danes‘ record at 7-4. Tltcn
came the best stretch of the season
for Aibnny. They won font in a row
to boost their record up to 11-4.

provided the spark. Skidmorc ran

Next up for Albany was the first

the women cagcrs lost to St.
Michael's in the title game 72-56
due to sotnc erratic foul shooting.
In fact. the Danes did not lind the
free throw line much to their liking
the entire year. Titc tcatn sltot only
50 percent from the line.

“The foul shooting hurt tts. and
it lost some games for us." com-
mented Warner. “But it‘s done

can go to the line with confidence."

Albany tltcn saw their record

game, i told tlte players ‘l.ook what

We‘re only losing one player and
next year we have only three
seniors."

That one player is l’cg Squat/.10,

"We’re looking forward on

developed. Things can only get bet-
ter." said Warner.
