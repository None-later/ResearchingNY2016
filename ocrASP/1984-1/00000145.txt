canceled plans to fly to

day. Mondale. John Glenn and the
Rev. Jesse Jackson also were con-
centrating their efforts there Mon-
day.

George McGovern left the region
and ﬂea- to Massachusetts where he
hopes to do well enough in next
Tuesday's primary to keep his mn-
didacy alive.

After the 60-minute debate Sun-
day sponsored by the League of
Women Voters in the Fox Theater
in Atlanta. Han. Mondale. Glenn
and Jackson all said they were

pleased.

“It should help." said Mondale.

“I thought it went exceptionally
well." said Glenn. “l was very
pleased with it."

“We did very well."
Jackson. “I'm imprased.“

Hart bntshed off suggestions that
the other four candidates ganged up
on him. “l thought it was a good
exchange." he said.

There is enough action on
"Super Tuesday“ for both Hart
and Mondale to claim victory.
although neither is likely to land a
knockout punch in the Democratic

said

presidential race.

The prospects are less hopeful for
the three dark horses. Glenn.
McGovern and Jackson.

Hart. riding a crest of four
maight state triumphs. will pro-
claim himselfa winner ifhe wins a

setibusly wounded if that happen-
ed. and his claim as delegate latter
would pale beside Hart's victory
string. But it would give him more

tum before it became overwhelm-
tng.

don’t elect images. We elect a
human being. ”

single primary. and he is heavily
favored in Massachusetts. His claim
to be a national candidate will be
even more enhanced if he ‘also
defeats the field in any of three
southern states. and public opinion
polls gise him a lead in Florida and
indicate he's drawing even in
Georgia.

Mondale, dethroned as front-
runner by Hart‘s string of trium—
phs. will proclaim the night a suc-
cess if he claims men a single
Southern victory from among
primaries in Georgia. Florida or
Alabama. Should he “in more. or
surprise Hart in Massachusetts or
Rhode Island. he will claim that his
rival‘s appeal is dissipating and see
hope for the contests ahead.

With 51! delegates at stake in
nest Tuesday’s contests — counting
the nine state contests plus delegate
selections by American Samoa and
Democrats Abroad — Mondale
could lose every single contest and
still be the leader in delegates.

Mondale's candidacy would be

It will be tougher for the other
three contenders.

Glenn was'touted earlier in the
year as Mondale's toughest com-
petition for the nomination. But
that was before the voters began
rendering their verdicts. and he has
failed to get above 13 percent in any
single contest.

McGovern has deﬁned his own
goal for next week. He says he will
withdraw from the race if he
doens‘t finish either ﬁrst or second
in the Massachusetts primary. the
only state he carried against
Richard Nixon in his I972 presiden-
tial race.

“I expect right down in my soul
I'm going to make it". he says. even
though public opinion polls show
him far behind Hart and Mondale
in the state.

“There's no question that l have
elevated my own stature; I'm just
told that constantly by party leaders

. I’ve restored myself as a na~
tionally respected ﬁgure in the
country." says McGovern.

Jackson says he's staying in the
race no matter what. but he
alrady lost federal matching cam-
paign funds and needs to receive 20
percent of the vote in any of the
states on Tuesday to re-qualify.

To date. Mondale has 148
‘ ' , supporting his nomina-
tion. while Hart is second with 27.
Glenn has l7. Those ﬁgures include
delegates chosen by the House
Democratic caucus, but do not in-
clude the eight for Hart and four
for Mondale given in preliminary
estimates from the results of voting
in Wyoming mucuses on Saturday.

During Sunday's debate former
front-runner Mondale questioned
whether there was any substance
behind Hart's “new ideas" cam-
paign.

"We don‘t elect momentum."
said Mondale. “We don’t elect im-
ages. We elect a human being."

Hart renewed his contention that
Mondale is too committed to ﬁlling
the desires of special interests to be
able to govern effectively.

All ﬁve candidates said they op~
posed President Reagan's proposed
l3 percent increase in defense spen-
ding. but they disagreed on whether
any increase is necessary.

Mondale and Hart said the}
favored an increase of about 4 pet-

oent; Glenn favored 6 percent..

McGovem said he would slash
defense spending by 25 percent.
Jackson cited no ﬁgure. but said he
would call on U.S. allies in Western
Europe and Japan to help “share
some of the burden" of maintain-
ing U.S. forces abroad.

Jackson chastised both Hart and
Mondale for refusing to commit
themselves to choosing a woman
for the vice presidential nomina-
tron.

Students ﬁnding ways to get into campus
movies without paying have cost University
Cinemas as much as $50 on crowded nights,
prompting clnemn officials to approach Slu-

denl Association for funds to hire uddltionnl’

security.

Incidents of door rushch who force their
way into movie showings in the Lecture
Center theaters are “getting to be a
problem." according to University Cinemas
Director Paul Baldino. Sometimes five to ten
people at a flute will push their way ittto a
movie without buying tl lickct tuttl efforts to

 

 

stop them have not been very fruitful. he
said.

University Cinemas submitted their budget
to SA near the end of February but did not
include it separate line request for the security
personnel in the proposed budget. snld
Baldino. “When we meet with SA we will ask
that the security personnel requested bc udd-
cd to the munngcr-projcctionisl line." he
said. This discussion. he said. will take place
within the next two weeks.

“I don‘t think tltcrc will boa problem after
we get this security," sttid Baldino.

Baldino snid lie was concerned with; these
people are upset with those who push their
way in without paying and take the seats that
others are willing to pay for. he explained.
Efforts by workers to stop groups of peo-
ple from entering shows without paying have
not been effective. according to Unlverlsity
Cinemas Treasurer Kent Hurdldgc. because
the workers are unpaid volunteers and as
such are not trained in crowd control. "The
crowds are large and the volunteers don‘t
want to cndahgcr themselves." he said. “It's
ttot our Jurisdiction to do this kind of work.
It would be better to have people there with
experience." he added.

Often people will also gain free entrance to
a movie using the “normal tricks." said Hur-
didge. Saying that they have to go in to find a
friend and then staying Is one method. he
said. Others will take one ticket. rip It in half
and try to get a fr'lend in for free saying that
they have already gone in and came back out.
To curtnil this. theater managers have recent-
ly begun stamping the hands of people who
go through the door, said Hurdidge.

Volunteer workers letting their friends in
for tree has ttlso been a recurring problem.
“We use a group of about 250 people.
volunteers who we rely on; it is difficult to
keep records of \\ll0 works well and who lcls
