' There has been no attempt in the past few

years to gain varsity status despite some of
the disadvantages that plague club-teams.
“It's been a dead issue for some time now,”
said Satterlee.

Besides not being recognized by the
athletic department ﬁnancially, the club-
team receives limited practice time in the
gym. The Danes are allotted three days a
week. totalling five hours.

“I do think we would be able to run more
practice time." said Davis. "Instead we just
drill the basics."

The lack of practice time certainly hasn't
hurt their play so far this season. Not only
have they swept their ﬁrst 12 matches. but
they've dropped only three games in the pro-
cess.

Their closest match was against Division I
Williams College. The Danes dropped the
first two games 10-15. and 12-15 but came
back to knot the best of five with overwhelm-
ing 15-3 and 15-5 triumphs. In the decisive
fifth game, Albany State came back from a
15-14 deﬁcit to score the final three points to
win in overtime l7-IS.

cocoons-‘00...

The Danes have faced and beaten the for-
midable Division I opponents such as Army.
Yale, Rochester. and Springfield. Albany
State also blanked sturdy Division II teams in
Concordia and Kings College.

The Duties still have two more meets re-
maining on their schedule: against Rochester
on March 24 and Cornell. Neither team
should pose too much of a threat to their
undefeated record.

If they beat Rochester. which they had no
problem doing earlier in the year. 3-0, the
Danes would mathematically clinch another
NCAA berth. Cornell should be another
pushover; they manhandled the Big Red last
Saturday. 3-0.

“I thought Cornell would be tougher.”_suid
Davis. “I think they were intimidated by our
size."

One particular varsity team that the Danes
have always faced in the past but did not
compete against this year was Harvard.
Despite the Danes having a 2-4 career record
against the Ivy League school. this season the
Crimson refused to play the Danes. allegedly
claiming they were only a club-team and
weren't good enough.

These statements did not sit well with the
players of Albany State and a rivalry has
resulted.

"Our little dream is to face Harvard in the
opening round of the NCAAs." said Sat-
tcrlce, “It is possible."

"They don‘t think we‘re good enough,"
added Davis. “Well, we’d really like to play
them In the first round."

The tournament doesn‘t begin until April
I4 so the Danes still must worry about com-

Croutier honored

Albany State guard Dan Croutlcr was
named to the honorable mention list of the
All-SUNYAC team. '

Croutier, a junior. led the Danes this
season in assists and set the All-Time
Albany State record for career assists.

This season the 5’7" point guard compil-

plating their regular season, rationing their
$1000 budget from SA, and maximizing their
utility from their allotted five hour practice
time. But nobody ls complaining about their
club-team status._

“We barely get any publicity and when we
do the focus is on the ﬁnancial issue," said
Satierlee. “We really don't want that, it's a
dead issue. We just want people to know that
we're doing a good job and to come out and
support us."
