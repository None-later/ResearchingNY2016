Fresh off their first win of tlte
, year. the Albatiy State men‘s indoor
soccer club flnislted a credible tltird
in a tough eight-team tournament
hosted by Southampton College.

lndoor soccer is well known for
high-scoring games. thanks to
hockey rink-like walls that keep tltc
ball in play and make for innovative
offensive plays. At Southampton.
there were no walls to let the ball
caromoff. just taped-down‘lines to
.mark what was ottt-of-bottnds. The

gym was also smaller than most in- .

door soccer fields. With all that in
mind. it was no surprise that the
Danes ﬁnished third. despite letting
in only three goals in four games.

“I like having the walls there."
said Scott Cohen. “With the walls.
it‘s almost like hockey. it's more
physical and it‘s a lot easier to
score. As it was. it was jttst like an
outdoor soccer game.“

Of the eight teams participating.
three of them were Division |
scltools. The first team that Albany
faced was one of those schools.
Hofstra. Albany upset the Dut-
chmen. Z-t. Hofstra was one of the
pre-tournament favorites to win. so
Albany's victory was all the more
surprising. '

“We came out and played really
well right from the start.“ said Carl
loos. “They couldn't penetrate our
defense. The goal they got catttc
frortt really far ottt. and Tommy
(goalie Merritt) was screened."

The two goal-scorers were Jerry
lsaacs and Mike (la/man. ln tlte
play preceding lsattc‘s goal. l-lofstra
was sending the ball ttpl'icltl ultctt
loos intercepted the ball and headed
it to a waiting lsaacs. “Their back
gtty chipped it in attd i just headed
the ball over him to Jerry." said
loos. “When the other team uses
everyone to attack. our platt should

basically be to counterattack. if we '

can get a quick outlet pass to Jerry,
Alike we did that time. he’ll have a
one-on-one with the goalie. in those
situations. he doesn't miss."
Albany tied on fluke rule
Albany's next gatne was against
Old Wc‘sthury. a match that cttdcd
up in a disappointing l-l tie. “They
had some good offensive players.
but we kept thcttt in check
thorttghout the game." said
defensctnart Cohen. “The way they
tied the game was a fluke."
in last week‘s
Albany was the beneficiary of a
special rttie that hosting team RPI
invoked. In the sccottd overtime
period. opposing teams played

without goaltenders. The law of ‘

averages caught up with Albany.
Normally. when the ball hits the
ceiling itt indoor soccer. the tcttm
that wasn‘t responsible would
receive an indirect free kick from
midcourt. According to tournament
rttles. the innocent team would
receive an indirect free kick directly
under the point where the bail hit
the ceilings Old Westbury was
granted the free kick five feet away

‘ t

front Albany’s goal.

"'Tiltll was a stupid goal." said
loos. “Our defensive wall has to bc
seven feet front where the free kick
will be taken. So there we were. two
feet itislde our own goal. Old
Westbury wasn't anywhere near ottr
caliber; they jttst got a lucky
break." r
#

“...'heg kicked the
' ball as hard as
I’ve ever seen
anyone kick it
before. Tommy
never had a.
chance. ”

—Scor! Cohen

Albany‘s lttsl qualifying game
was against Stony Brook. a game
that ended itt a scoreless tie. “We
ltad many chances to scotchbut we
couldn‘t capitalize on those
chances." said Cohen. "They had
hardly any shots on goal. Mean-
wltile. we hit the post a couple of
times and a few of our shots just
went wide." '

Danes lose in semis

The two ties put Albany into the
semifinals against Adelphi, another
Division I team. This time however,
Albany came up short. l-0.

“Adelphl had a high level of
skill. but we had our chances." said
loos. “We were basically evenly
matched. and we figured we could
have won it all if we got past
Adeiphl."

The Adclphi goal was scored in
spectacular fashion. "The guy on
Adelphl dribbled the ball down
midfield." recalled Cohen. “No
one picked him up. and then he
kicked the ball as hard as I've seen

anyone kick it before. Tomttty (the
goalie) never ltad a chance."
Aibatty was without one of their
best players. Terry Bacchus. Bac-
chus suffered an injury at last
week's tournantent and decided to
rest for this weekend's tournament.

The nteet's biggest story was
junior Ed McGill's stellar perfor-
ntancc in the 3000-metcr run. After
losing narrowly in the 3000 last
week at ihc SUNYACs. McGlll
retttrned to Albany determined to

just a solo run-through with McGill

  Men’s volleyball club unbeaten'after 12 meets

By Marc Barman
assocm TE 5mm: EDITOR

They are the only unbeaten. Albany State
sports team. yet the Great Dane men‘s
volleyball club might be in the midst of the
last season of their successful four year
history. . ~

in l98l, budget constraints forced the
men's volleyball program to be degraded
from varsity status down to club team. As a
club. the team does not get the support in
terms of coaching. uniforms. and trip money
that varsity teams do. bttt it is still SA fund-
ed. ln the last two seasons. the squad recciv.
ed a bid to the NCAA Tourttameut. ati honor
in itself. arid was eliminated iii the first
round.

This seasott. the Danes are playing the best
volleyball in the club's history. Albany has
swept their first twelve matches and last
Saturday's romp over Cornell ttnd Rl’l at
University Gym virtually clinched another
berth in the NCAAs. '

And there is an extra incentive for this
year's squad to try to get past the first round:
six of the ttinc tnetnbers are graduating in
June and the odds of a men’s volleyball pro~
gram sttrviving next season is slim.

“I gttcss you can say it's our last tango."
retnarkcd captain-coach Brian Sittterlce. who
is one of the six graduating. "There‘s a real
good attitude on the team. We‘re just going
to go for it all."

Sophomore Kurt Davis also sees tltc team
playing a little harder: I‘l think everyone
wants to go out successful. You can see the
seniors putting out a little extra. It's never
talked about. bttt you kttow it‘s on
everyone‘s mind."

Since the eittb doesn't have varsity status.
and are ttot athletically funded. they will ttot
be able to “go for it all." An NCAA t'ttlc
states that ifa club team advances to the fittal
fottr of the NCAA. tltcy automatically
become disqttalified from the tournament.

However. tltc Danes are not thinking that
far ahead. The first goal is getting past the
first round. art accomplishment in itself.

Part of the problem has been their poor.
seeding positions. which have forced them to
face extra-strong competition in the ﬁrst
round. ’ s

Last season they opened up the NCAAs
against Pittsburgh, a team ranked third in the
East and twelfth in the nation with several
players on full scholarships. Not surprisingly.
the Danes suffered a severe beating and failed
to win a game in the best of ﬁve series. '

“We didn't embarrass ourselves. bttt we
didn't come ciose either." said Satterlee, who
has been on the club since a freshman. I

Many followers of the team agree that this
year's edition would have fared better against
Pittsburgh. “We have a good attitude attti
we're all team players." added Sattcrice.

Besides last year's junior players gaining
tnore experience and molding into a closer
ttttit. a key factor that has turned this team
itito the dominant force they are. is the addi-

tiott ol'sophomore Kttrt Davis. Davis. a 6'5"
190 pounder has given Albany State the big
hitter they sorely needed.

A litrcc~timc Empire State Game partici-
pant. Davis played last year for Co-Sun. a
sttccessful Albany-based volleyball club
which made it to the Nationals. Davis quit
('o-Sun to join the Albany State Club for this
season and is only one of three players who
will not be graduating in June.

Other key members that will be graduating
are center Mike Weisman and Joel Vilinsky.
Both are among the shorter members of the
team, standing at 6'0". tWo incltes below tltc
average height. Weisman. also ttn cx-Co-Sun
player. is a fantastic athlete and excels at the
center position.

Davis seems pessimistic about the team's
chances of sttrvival next season. “i don't see
anyone coming into the school next year."
said Davis who will compete irt his fourth
Empire State Games this summer. “The team
has never had to look (for players) before."

Of course. recrttiting won‘t be easy since
lltc unit doesn't cveti have a hired coach let
alone a recruiting staff.
