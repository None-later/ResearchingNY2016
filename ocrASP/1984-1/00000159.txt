debateand eight ballots spread over
two sessions.'on Wednesday nigln
Cetttral Council finally selected
State Quad ‘

representative Sal W
Pcrcdnia to be its .
new-Vice chair. " 

P e r e d‘n i it
replaces Barbara Hurwitz who
resigned two weeks ago. citing Stu-
dent Association politics its the
reason for her resignation.

Other events at the Council
meeting inclttded SA Vice President
Jeff Schneider's accusation that the
recommendations of the alcohol
policy task force were ignored by
Vice President for Student Affairs
Frank Pogue. and an announce-
ment by SA President Rich Schal‘l‘cr
that changes in tire University‘s
drop-add policy are being con-
sidered by a University Senate corn-
tntttce. .

in all. ten Council representatives
were nominated for vice chair.
Alumni Quad representative uttd
vice-chair'candidate Steve Rttsso ex-
pressed disappointment with the
voting for the position.
“Everything had gotten out of
hand." he claimed.

After the meeting. Russo said. “i
felt the elections became extremely
politicized." He added. "1 was ag—
gravated. i wasn't going to play the
game anymore."

Last week Russo and Off (‘am-
ptts representative Dave Silk
withdretv frqu the vice chair race
with hopes of getting a compromise

candidate elected. But after four
ballots last week no candidate was
able to pick up the twenty votes
needed for election.

Silk did not rttrt Wednesday. bttt
Russo decided to re-cnter the race.
. Again. Russo failed to receive twen-
ty votes and withdrew after tlte sc-
cond ballot. saying tltat Council

“didn't seem to care." about the

vote. “I'm really disappointed." he

sttid. '

Pcrcdnia said he was surprised to
even be nominated. He was
nominated twice bttt refused the
first nomination because. lte said. it
came “out of the blue."

He said that sotne council
tuetnbers told him to reconsider and
after the second'notnination he ac-
cepted because he had “nothing to
lose.“ Pcrcdnia said he would have
dropped out of the race if he
"didn‘t get too many votes." “I'm
sure Sal will be a fine vice chair."
said Russo.

0n the final ballot Pcrcdnia
received twenty votes. off campus
representative Dwayne Sampson
received only one vote. There were
three abstentions.

Before the second of the four
ballots. State Quad representative
Steve Gawlcy said. “if we have
another ballot it's going to be
stupid." He urged Council to “get
on with otlter business."

Alcohol Policy

According to Scltneider. student
members of the alcohol policy-task
force are “pretty pissed off” by
Pogtte's recommcttdations to the
Stttdent Affairs Council. a Univer-
sity Senate comtnittec.

Poguc recotnmendcd that kegs be
banned but hccr balls be pcrmntit-
ted in suite rooms.

According to Schneider. the task
force recommended that beer balls
“always” be perntittcd and that
kegs be allowed on a provisional
basis. The task force decided that

students should fill out a form in
order to obtain a keg. he said.
Those students who ltad not cattscd
“trouble” witlt kcgs iii the past
would be pcrntillcd use of a keg.
said Schneider.

Pogue‘s recotnmendtttions reflect

“absolutely nothing" of what the '

task force
claimed.

Sehafl‘cr said that Poguc's ac-
tions were “hurting everyone."
Both students and residential'staff
would be harmed. he asserted. “lt
pits students against students." he
said. because enforcement of the
policy would have to be carried out
by R.A.‘s.

Scltat‘fcr said lte has heard corri-
plaints about l‘ogue's recommenda-
tions frotn several R.A.‘s.

Poguc. Schafl'cr said. is not all-
tnepting to ignore the task force's
recommeudatiotts. “I don‘t think
lte sees what he's doing; we‘re try-
ing to show him how he affects"
students. maintained Schaft'er.

"Student input doesn't mean a
damn thing if it's ignored." said
Schneider. who was one of five slu.
dent representatives on the task
force.

. Drop-Add l'ollcy

Schaft'cr mentioned that the
Undergraduate Acadctnic Council
of the University Senate is consider-
ing a new drop policy. If the new
policy is approved by the Senate. he
said. there would be. itt effect. two
drop days.

The earlier date would be ten
days after the start of the semester.
lfu student dropped a course within
the first tell days. nothing would

appear on the student's transcript.
If a stttdcnt dropped after the tenth
day. ltc or she would receive a “W”
on his or her transcript.

Surprised to even have been nontina/ed

The rationale for the policy is
that the Registrar's Office is over-
worked, said Schaffer. He gave an
example of a student who registered
for 36 credits during one semester
to demonstrate the problem that the
Registrar faces.

He said the new policy. if passed.
would not be implemented until the
spring semester of 1985. Seltal‘l‘er
added that he was concerned with
the "motivation behind" the pro-
posal.

According to Schaffcr. a bill that

In an effort to rekindle alumni interest and
honor those who have aided SUNYA inter-
collegiate athletics. University officials have
decided to create a SUNYA athletic hall of
fame. Those to be honored are former
lathletes. athletic faculty members and others
who have played an integral role in the suc-
cess of Albany athletics. 

According to Associate Athletic Director
Pat Rogers, the idea for a hall of fame ltas
been. "a concept in the tninds of some of our
senior faculty members for a number of
years."

A room on the third [Tour of the gym has
been set aside to house the hall of fame. and
decorating work on the room is currently in
progress.

A seven-member committee has been set
up to lay the groundwork for the progratn.
Track Coach Bob Munscy and former wrestl-
ing coach Joe Garcia. are responsible for.the
constituition for the hall of fame. Rogers.
Athletic Director Dr. William Moore. and
Sports Information Director Marc Cunn-
ingham have been decorating the room.

Head Basketball Coach Dr. Richard
Saucrs attd Head Football Coach Bob Ford
are in charge of coordinating funding for the
project. “We're hoping to get contributions
from private individuals who are interested.
from UAS. from Albany Altttnni Association

\

and their annual fund drive. and events in the‘
gym. in the past we've had the

Globetrotters." Sauers explained.

Director of Physical Plant Maintenance
Dennis Stevens arranged for his crew to do
the refurbishing of the room to transform it
from a former weight room to a hall of fame.

The selection method. outlined in the con-
stitution. and approved by University Presi-
dent Vincent O'Leary last May involves a
three step process. -

The first step is open nominations. Forms
for this can be obtained through Moore's of-
fice: these fortns can either be picked up in

a number of years. ”

person. or itttcrestcd individuals can phone
the office to have one sent to them.

Next. applicants are reviewed by a
10-member nomination board. comprised of
two administrators. recommended by
O’Leary: four faculty tnembers. suggested by
the athletic director; and fottr alumnus. stig-
gcslcd‘ by the director of Alumni Affairs.

They will then send their nominations to a

seven-member board which will make the
ﬁnal decisions. Vice President of f lnancial af-
fairs Lewis Welch will be one of the board
members.

The deadline for nominations this year is
April 15. In future years. the deadline will be
30 days before the last day of the spring
semester. .

The first inductions will be October 12.
1984. during Homecoming Weekend. Cur-
rcnt students will most probably not be
familiar with the majority of the initial in-
ductees due to the fact that an athlete is not
eligible to be selected until they are out of the
school for five years.

The requirement for the induction of, an
athletic staff tnetnber is that they be a
member of the University Community for at
least five years.

An honorary selection may be made to
honor and memorialize people who have
demonstrated extraordianry dedication and
support to the athletics program who are not
eligible ttnder the other two sections.

The final selection board is expected to be
announced by O'Leary within the next two
weeks. lictwecn four and six people will be
inducted annually.

According to Moore tltc reason for the
small group is so that tltcy remain “selective
and don't fall into a trap.“ He also added
that for the first inductions the number may
bca little higher. H

Genesis, the Sexuality Resottrcc Center is
now working ttnder “the ttmbrella of Middle
Earth“ and is included in the latter group's
budget proposal for next year. according to
Genesis officials._

“There has been a marriage between
(iencsis’ and Middle Earth." said Rena
Paullay. student director of Genesis. Tllc
Genesis hotline was incorporated into the
Middle Earth hotline during the sttmnter and
is being answered by people from Middle
Earth. she said. “We‘re (Genesis) a sub-
specialty group of Middle Earth.“ slte added.

Proposals to merge the two groups were
first tliscusscdd last Spring. according to Val
Fahey. an advisor to Middle Earth and
(icncsis. “A request was made to Middle
liar th through Martha Fitch (former director
of Gettcsis)." she explained.

Many services were duplicated by the two
groups. according to Puttlloy. These services
included workshops in areas of sexuality and
relationships. and referral to appropriate
agencies.

“When Genesis did sexuality workshops.
Middle Earth tried to do other things that
werc counseling-related." said Fahey.
Members of Genesis saw the duplication and
agreed to the merger.

The Genesis staff was not trained in
counseling. unlike the Middle Earth staff. ac-
cording to Fahey. People in Genesis are
trained in handling educational Workshops.
referral and in dispensing information. she
added.

Very often "when people come in for. in-
formation it leads to counseling." Feltcy
said. and Genesis was not set up to do that.

Genesis staff members arcvrccruitcd from a
CPY 311 Course given at SUNYA. according
to both Fahey and Paullay.

Gcncsis‘ information files have been mov-
ed into the Middle Earth office. Staff
members of. both groups will work on up-
dating Middle Earth’s files. which do not
have the latest information. according to
Fahey.

Fahey said she was approached by David

sentcstcr. “Genesis did not want to lose their
identity" after the merger took place. she ex-
plained. ' .
“Martha was afraid if she left. it (Genesis)
would tltcn be defunct." said Paullcy.

At an informal meeting Tuesday night.
members of Genesis discussed what projects
would he handled by the committee in the
fttlttre. “They (Gencsis) decided to hopefully
do projects like Sexuality Week." explained
Fahey.

These possible projects inclttdc workshops
on contraceptives and self-examinations. a
one-day conference similar to tire three-day
conference during Sexuality Week. and get-
ting involved in ttnivcrsity Task Forces that
address the issue of sexuality. "Genesis will
become a little more assertive and a little
tuorc active.“ said Peggy Attn Dorrian. a
graduate student and advisor to Genesis.

The Middle Earth Finance Committee
decided to inclttdc a butlgct line for the
Genesis conttnittee in their Student Associa-
tion (SA) budget proposal. Middle Earth did
not have the tnoncy for Genesis‘ outreach
workshops. “it is not a huge amount of
money. bttt for program printing and adver-
tising cost." said Fahey.

“One thing we're trying to do with next
year's budget is to consolidate groups that
have common interests and try to avoid
duplication of services." said Adam Barsky.

basic needs are money for advertising and

The merger is “very beneficial." said

"Sexuality is an area that covers a lot of
