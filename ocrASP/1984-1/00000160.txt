Crlmirtal Justice at tlte Nelson A. Rockefeller
College of Pttblic Affairs artd Policy here at
SUNYA. sees his aftliction with Cerebral
Palsy (C.P.). as ttotlting more titan “a big
pain irt ttte butt." ‘ .

Tite 28-year-old gradttate 
student was diagnosed
shortly after birth as having 
a slight case of C.P., which,
according to the small-framed. blond-haired
Gewerth "is cttttsed by tile irtlerrttption of the
llow of oxygen to the brain shortly during or
following birth." However. “C.P. is very
different frottt mental rctardatiott because it
effects voluntary functions sttclt as move-
ment and speech. It does not impair thinking
ability." he said as his fingers tapped
rythmically upon the neatly kept top of his
wooden desk.

Gewerth's speech is ttol at all affected by
CF. The only tltittg that sets him apart from
other people is a pair of wooden crutches
leaning against tltc radiator of ltis office.
located downtown on the second floor of
Draper Hall.

Although they seettt to be forgotten in his
office. the faded and battered crutches play a
necessary part in Ciewerth‘s daily life. “it's
like trying to walk around with a bad sprain.
Yott become tnore conscious of (walking).
something that everyone else takes for
granted." he 5' id. "But i get around
alright... Albatty is a nice-sized city with a
well-developed public transportation
system."

Gewcrth has found tltal there is a spectrum
_on which he bases other people‘s reactions to
him. At one extreme are people who want to
raise him up to saittlltood. “i went to a
Catltolic grammar school where the tttins
constantly used trte as an example." hc'said.
“l have problems, bttt we all ltavc problems
we're coping with on a daily basis. We're all
super-huntans in that respect." '

On the other extreme are people who do
not become comfortable around him.
Gewerth explained. “l'll try three or four
times tomake someone comfortable around
me... if they don‘t respond after that it’s no
longer my problem. it's theirs. However."
said Gewerth with a smile. “you get real good
at making people feel comfortable around
you. I've learned to use humor a lot of
times."

People rarely react to him itt either ex-
treme. “Most of the tittte my handicap can be
ignored." lte said as be adjusted his glasses
upon his boyish face. “Most people are really
cool about it."

As a graduate student. (icwe’rth has am-
bitiously completed all ltts coursework and
now divides his titne between generating a
prospecttts for his doctoral dissertationand
team-teaching CRJ 20]. an introductory
Criminal Justice course. with Professor
Donald J. Newman. Gcwerth has chosen the
field of elderly offenders for the topic of his
dissertation. "The Criminal Justice system is
not designed to deal with elderly offenders."
ltc said. “Prosecutors don't kttow what to do
with them... send ‘em to Attica?"

“We all have
problems we ’re

dealing with on a

daily basis ”
.

“Take fol example." stated (icwerlh. "a
caSc witcrc an elderly titan is arrested for a
particular olt‘ettsc. Bail is set. attd the trial
date is three months away. lint as is the case
willt tttatty elderly people on a fixed-income
heyannot afford to pay tltc bail and haul
watt itt jail for three months for his trial to
come up."

"Time in these cases is all important fac-
tor." said (icwerlh. “because if this elderly
man dies within the three months lte ls spen-
ding in jail awaiting trial, he has technically
served a life sentence for a crime he was never
convicted of."

said. “we are in a unique position to an.

A new system for assignment of
order numbers for purchase of
senior week tickets has been for-
tnttlatcd according to Attn Marie
LaPorta, Class of ‘84 President.

This year. students will be given
random. prc-assigned numbers
when they pick up their senior
cards. Cards will be distributed
March 19-23 front lOa.m. to4 pap.
at the tltird floor of the Cantpus
Center. Extender] hours from 7 to 9
p.tn.. March 2! are included for
those who can't make it dtlriltg the
regular hours. The cards will make
seniors eligible to participate in

“events planned for senior week.

May 12-19.

The new system was devised
because itt previous years the line
that formed outside the Campus
Center and stretched across the
podium had become unruly
because. “people's tempers flare
after waiting on littc so long." said
La Porta.

The numbers are assigned to
determine in ivhat order seniors can
btty tickets to events. l’our card
holders cart cotttc itt to btty tickets
on any one number. said Lai’orta.
Site equated the ttcw system to the
present housing lottery. nth scrtior
card entitles tltc heater to buy 1
ticket at the senior price attd 1. ticket
at the non-senior price.

ltt order to obtain a senior card,
clttss tlucs must be paid itt fttll and.
according to Lal’orta, what her

 

 

records say. goes. “However, if
there is a discrepency we will check
with student accounts to back as
up. irt which case there will be a one
day lag in issuance." LaPorta add-
ed that dues are $3 per semester.
$24 in total for the 2,500 seniors.
The dues are used to subsidize
events during senior week.

The decision to change the system
was reached last semester in class
cottttcil with LaPorta casting the
deciding. tie-breaker vote.

The senior brochure which will
ittclttdc the price list and number of
people permitted will be made
available in the beginning of April.
said LaPorta. ,
