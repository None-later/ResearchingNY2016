LETTERS '-
Freedom ﬁghters

To theEdttor:

While dressing for the Irish Club's Prc-St. Patrick‘s Day
Party. I had to decide between tt shirt or a green sweatshirt.
This would be a pretty inconsequential decision except that
on my sweatshirt the words — IRA. Freedom Fighters — are
printed. I decided against wearing it. because I wanted to
have fun. not political arguments all night.

Making this choice triggered many thoughts in my mind.
Last year. at this time. i wrote a letter to the ASP calling for
American involvement in Northcn Ireland. and I supported
the IRA. Mttch has occurcd since then. The situation has
worsened. and tltc IRA has increased its activities which
many regard as tcrrorist. innocent bystttndcrs huvc suffered
and died as a rcsult of IRA actions.

In view of this. I had to rc-cvnlutttc my opinion of the
IRA: tltc loss of lives and property left me fccling ant-
bivalcnt. I wasn‘t sure if I could wholchcartcdly support
tltcnt ttftcr suclt incidences. My wardrobe contemplation
brought my cmotionnl dcbntc to tltc surface, and i came to a
decision. I regret tltc civilian deaths. The IRA has not intcn-
tionally desired to hurt innocent people. but such accidents
always occur in war. That is. in effect. what is going on in
Nortltcrn Ireland. The [RA has dcclarcd war on England for
tltc land they have takcn from Ireland. England dismisses
this claim and avoids tltc issue; it refuses to sincerely
ncgotiatc while at the same time, it fails to enter into a clear-
cut confrontation. Instead its soldiers shoot unarmed
children with illegal rubber bullets that kill. and then ra-
tionalize it under the guise of keeping the peace.

Ireland has endured 800 years of this cruel impcrialistic
treatment. This beautiful island has bcc’n dividcd and stained
with its people's blood for too long. Ircland cries for justice
and freedom. This is the foundation of tltc lRA. I am usually
against violence. but in this case it is justified. Death is
always rcgrcttablc. but unless tltc situation changes soon.
more and more senseless deaths of both Irish and Britiin
citizens will occur.

Constructive tone

To the Editor:

As it long-time avid reader of the Editorial Pages 1 was
struck by tltc consistently serious constructive tone of all
tltrcc letters in the exchange between Sharon Long and Kap-
pu fraternity member Patti David Brown. Miss Long made a
Vcry valid poittt with her two letters concerning tltc ever-
present potential that arty group of people who organize
themselves toward accomplishing a goal may. in tltc process.
nlicnntc others with tltc sntnc goal who are ttot group
members. The point was worth making. Unt'ortunntcly. tltc
Kttppus wcrc tltc cxamplc chosen when lit fnct. they seem to
be conscious of tltc ncgatlvc cffccts of clitist uttitudcs. What
I found cspccittlly lttlprcssivc was tltttt ticspitc wltntcvcr faults
of logic cxlst in Mr. Brown‘s reply to tire first letter. he did
not trcat it as an attack on his organization. Rather, he
presented facts that were mostly pcrtincnt and vcry
enlightening. He did not choose to countcrttttck. bttt ittstcnd
sought to make the nature of thc Knppns organizution clcar.
By bcing rational, cairn. and informative, Mr. Brown's
defense of his organization was successful without being
defensive.

Ms. Long‘s second letter was also commendable. Sltc
rcstatcd her original point clcarly. explained wily site had us-
ed lllc Kappas as her example and apologized for her ig-
norancc. All three letters Iackcd tltc malevolent tone that in-
validates the vast majority of letters I've read in my few years
here. Why can‘t more exchanch be handled in such a
mature. conversational and informative way. It’s nice to sec
that some people know how to rcspcct each other and don’t
scc the editorial page of thc ASP as tltc place to air their dirty
laundry.

Long term results

To the Editor:

It was brougltt to my attention that tltc SUNYA
Rntltskcllcr has been deficient in its ctnploymcnt of
minorities and ntinority functions. Only recently have tltc
powers Iltrtt bc (tltosc itt control of tltc I’ttb's ttctivitics)
sought to ratify these problems by intplcmcnting changes to
spark tttlnority intcrcst. chncstlay night Disco :ti tltc Rnt is
a splendid example of tltc ncccssnry steps that nccds to bc
tnkctt in order to provide tttttlticultural cntcrlninmcnt.
however I have heard tttcntlonctl itt tltc past. that tltc
management is COIIL‘CI‘nCd for a widcr variety of music during
this night. This of course would be dcl‘cttting tltc prcscnt pttr-
posc of tltc one night per wcck tltnt provich a divcrsity of
Il‘luSlClllili cun ltttrtlly bc l'ottnd clscwltcrc. I’crhttps il'tltc sug-
gestion of interlacing tltc two prominttnt titttsicttl tttstcs was
to bc incorporated into tltc Pub's OVL‘rtil wcckly formttt. thttn
Ihc ttccd for an exclusive Disco night would not be ill] cut-
pllttSlS.

Tltct‘c‘~ttl'c. It) tltc best of my knowlcdgc. no full tintc minori-
ty cmployccs. One was hired for tltc short duration of two
wccks bttt was quickly dismissed ttndcr umbiguous cir-
cumstances. i once again find myself questioning tltc exact
intentions of tltc management at the SUNYA Ratitskcllcr.
Thereeccm to bc a pattern of good token beginnings but a
long tcrnt result of underlying obscure intent. I can only hope
that no ftttttrc ratification take place that circumciscs minori-
ty conccrns.

College radio fan

To the Editor:

First of all. I write this Icttcr as a firm supporter of both
collcgc radio. and WQBK-FM. I felt after. reading Dianne
Pine's article (The Sole Music Alternative. Feb. 28 ASP) I
ought to clarify my position. Yes. I04 has changed. and yes

- we are aiming our sound at an older audience. more itt-

tcrcstcd in hearing their fav0ritcs than the latest new sound.
As for the community's response -— 2 to I in favor of the
change. and excited to have an alternative to kiddie top 40.
and geritol rock.

I cannot speak for my co-workers. but I have always been
a college radio fan. and always will be as along as students
are free to say and play what they feel is important. I have a
good reason to feel this way — my last station was WAER at
Syracuse University which recently fell into University con-
trol. Hired cntployccs make all the decisions. and students
push buttons and give tltc time and tcntpcratttt'c. I listen to
WCDB (along with eight other college stations) to hear
nvant-gardc music, studcnts' opinions. and campus informa-
tion. One area I disagree with Dianne about is music. I say
keep it pure — 100 pcrcctit avant-garde. If people find it
“weird” —— tough lttck. tttrn tltc dial. no one is going to go
broke zit collcgc radio from bad rulings. thn I hear Spr-
ingsiccn. tltc Stones, or Motown on a college stntion. I’m not
ltcztring tltc ncxt U2 or REM. Oncc something becomes ob-
viously tttztinstrcttm I tltink a college station should move on
to the next thing. or investigate a genre of music that went
ttnnpprccintcd by tltc masses in tltc past. If WCDB has the
nerve to call itself an alternative it ought to be just that. and
leave the Rolling Stones to the seven commercial popular

music stations; in the area. ' 1
Which icnds me to the “new QBK-FM l04" which chang-
ed and reflected a change which hits taken place nationally
and locally. Personally. I wish Americans were as Interested
in thcmuslc scene as British folk seem to be —- quick to ac-
cept. and always supiclous of success. But. they are not. and
I've got to. dent with that and buy groceries. We will play
good music. familiar music. and a good variety of music.
Both I04 and 91 FM face a challenge —- to do what they do
best in the Capital District.

Lack in communications

To the Editor: .
We've heard that the Conmtunicntions Department was
going downltill, bttt we didn't rcnlizc to what extent they
would go. to nttcmpt to cxptutd its diminishing fncttlty. We
as students of SUNY Alitttny and Corn 238, Rhetoric of Mass
Mcdin. fch slightcd by tltc communications department‘s at-
tcntpt to meet studcnt course needs by allowing fellow
undergraduates to fulfill tltc responsibilities of Teaching
Assistant positions ottcc Itcld by graduate students.

We fail to understand ltow any undergraduate has enough
expertise to critically unttlyzc and evaluate papers written by
their peers. Whether or not an undcrgraduatc has enough
background and cxpcricncc to enhance a subject beyond the
content of the book must be questioned.

It is not our intention to say that these students are in-
competent as teaching assistants. 0n tltc contrary. they seem
to know the subject tttuttcr within the course and are well
prepared for discussion sections.

Truthfully. many tfnticrgrndtttttcs may have the potential
to fulfill the dctnttttds rcttircd of at T./\. The point is that we
were under tltc imprcssion when we came to this institution
that we would be educated by ntorc qualified individuals.

Apparently. the Communications Department docs not
find it important enough to obtain thc rcspcct ofthc student
population at SUNY Albuny. ~

Keep lounge open

To the Editor:

The third floor Humanities Lounge Campaign is still a dif-
ficult and undccidcd issue. The simplc effort of a collcction
of students who Iovc tt lottngc ttnd fight to save it has turned
into a largc-scttlc ltlbll)‘ to tltc liillVL‘l‘Sliy administration.
Mttclt effort and thought were poured into this campaign.
and ntoncy. bill it is int from sulvctl. A major effort will be
made lit the coming \tccks to thClth this issue. We need your
help. Stttdcnt petitions Ctlii still be found outside tltc S.A.
Contact Office, tllld itt tltc lttttngc itscil‘. ttltcn it is open in tltc
mornings. Below is ill] ctlitcd t'ct‘sittn of it new petition. in-
tended for tltc faculty of SUNYA. Iltztt outlittcs our position
and ottr program.

Tltcrc is ntorc ton university than just books and tcnchcrs.

Rcmctnbcr tltc people who cxisl ltcrc its well.

' “STUDENTS AGAINST TO'I‘ALITARIAN ENACT-
MENTS"

“We hereby affirm ottr belief that tltc third floor
Humanities lounge is an important element in tltc intellectual
growth and maturity of tltc students of this university. Since
it was opcned. tltc lounge has been in an enriching co-
existence with tltc faculty. clubs. and students of SUNY.
Recently. the lounge has been autocratically declared closed
and locked to students. except for a meager four hours each
day. The stated reason for this action is to keep the lounge
clean. This reason is proved inadequtc every day during the
school week at 11:30. when the persons who serve morning
coffee clean up loosc cups and scraps of litter. Also. the
lounge still undcrgocs regular maintenance at least once per
week. The lounge is a necessary clctncnt in tltc Humanities
department, and to the campus. Very few lounges are left at
SUNYA. especially in the academic buildings. and without
the Humanities lounge another opportunity for free and
open communication would be lost. This loungc is important
to the academic atmosphere and to student life in the
Humanities building, especially for off-campus and night
students. Thc proposed rcdccoration of the lounge is not the
issue. Paint. perhaps a new rttg. and new furniture would im-
prove its appearance. bill should not change its function.
Tltc lounge is an intellectual marketplace. not a sltowpiccc
living room. S.A.T.E. rcqucsls that:

I. Tltc Loungc should be lct't open to unscltcduled students
for study. conversation. and personal thought for as long as
the building itsclf is open.

2. Any mcctings. lccturcs. or similar functions that wish to
use the Lounge have a right to tltc exclusive use of tltc room.
after signing for it in tltc Appointmcnt Book at tile Dcnn’s
Officc. Ilcl'orc and after these events. tltc Lounge is to be
rcturncd to its function pcr statement number i.

3. Thu cleanliness of tltc Lounge is to be maintained by a
clean-up of loose pupch and cups daily by the morning cof-
fcc scrvcrs. tind by t'cgulnr tnaitcnttncc mctltods. Students
will also be cncourttgctl to maintain tltc cleanliness of the
Lounge by S.A.T.E.

4. All efforts should be made by the administration of this
ttnivcrsity to maintain tltc Lounge pcr statements I and 2.
