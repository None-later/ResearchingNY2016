"The Soviet Union sends their
best students to SUNY Albany to
represent their country. it is a pro-
paganda tool for them. The Russian
students should see that we care
about our people," said Jonathan

I Abrahams, a RZA member. He

held a poster with a picture of a
l4-year-old Jewish girl who was. he
said, imprisoned by Soviet officials.

Elisa Stein agreed with the idea of

' the rally. but did not agree with the

methods used by the Zionist Alter-
native group. “They keep saying
that they are glad that the Russian
students are here and they're not
against that, yet- they’re using their

were not able to meet with her, said
committee chair Neil Shapiro.
Interview Policy
A bill defining SA's interview
policy was sent back to the Internal
Affairs committee because SA
Minority Affairs Coordinator 
vian Vazquez was not consulted in
its formulation.

A bill that would permit Council
members to leave meetings after

she added.

Another student who stayed for
mOst of the rally said that as a Jew
he did not agree with the zionists
“militant-like" tactics. “Any Rus-
sian that wants to leave the Soviet
Union should be allowed to, but
they are not. The issue to stress here
is not emigration to lsrael, but the
oppression of the Jews and how it
can be stopped.” he said.

After the rally. RZA-Tagar
members walked over to President
Vincent O’Lcary's office with a let-

TV ratings for college hoops drOp

(AP) Another sign is at hand that
American public's supposedly in-
satiable appetite for televised sport
may in fact be quite satlahlc.
Following the example of college
and pro football. college basketball
ratings are down.

The problem is most severe for
NBC, which carried more than 40
games this season but doesn't have
the NCAA tournament. It has
dropped from a rating of 5.5 last
season to 4.3 this year while CBS,
with about 10 fewer games, has full—
cd only from 5.5 to 5.4. Some of the
regional conference packages are

having similar trouble.

CBS stands to recoup during the
tournament, starting tonight at
11:00 p.m. EST when it opens its
coverage witlt the Dayton-LSU
game from Salt Lake City. But
NBC. out of the tournament pic-
ture. may cut back next year.

There are a variety of theories for
the drop, the most prcvalcttt thc
overexposure brought on by the
glut of games, built on cable and
network. “A big reason." says
NBC's Rich Husscy, “is too tnany
games on TV on a Saturday after—

,‘noon.”

FRIDA Y. MARCH 16, I984 D’ALBANY STUDENT PRESS  13

liven more so. say TV people, are
too many meaningless games.

With 53 teams in the NCAA tour-
nnntcttl — increasing to 64 next
year — and conference tour-
naments in which a team that gets
hot for three games can wipe out a
bad season, it means little if a Kcn-
tttcky gcts kttockcd off by a
Vanderbilt on a given Saturday.
There's no way Kentucky will miss
the NCAAs so there‘s no suspense
-—— and Sttspcttsc and uncertainty is
the stuff of which TV drama is
tirade.
