“The basic separation of church and state. I
don ‘I think kids should be pressured directly
or indirectly for prayer. I think he (Reagan)

would have done it anyhow. It's one of the
reasons I didn ’I vote for him in the first
place. "

"If you ‘d like to say a prayer it '5 optional. I
don '1 think you should have to stand up and
say it collectively. If you don 't choose to you
don 't Itave to. I think it 's geared for the con-
servatives and the liberals will move against

Attltddes changing toward women F

 

‘who choose math, science fields

By Judy Geshwlnd

“In America. thcrc is a different attitttdc
about women working  it's how the woman
views hcrsclf. but I see this attitttdc
changing." said Nadya Lumclsky. a gt'ttdtttttc
student in Biology at SUNY Albany, and a
Russian immigrant.

tcc Prcsidcnt for
Academic Affairs Judith 
Ramalcy ttddrcxscd the
changing attitudes about 

women working, and the reasons behind tltc
lack of \votttctt studying sciences in an inter-
vicw itt ltcr ol'l'icc Monday.

Rtttnalcy said tltat itt high schools ttnd in
junior ltiglt schools, young women are being
encouraged to take more science and
tnttthcmalics courses. Sltc said tltat in ordcr
to enter tltc scicttccs, “long preparation is
nccdcd." \Votncn arc being cncottragcd to
kccp tltcir options opened." she added.

At the college level. wotncn are ttow
“smart” as to knowing ltow thcy can best
prcscnt themselves as a “strong” candidate
for cntcring graduate school. They know
how important it is to participate itt such ttc-
tivitics as community scrvicc and to do
rcscarch, said Ratnalcy. She added that
graduate schools are ttow "actively
rccrttiting" women students who arc talctttcd
and qualified.

Ratnalcy comtncntcd that things are even
changing at the kindcrgartctt level. “The pic-
tures around the kindergarten room used to
show a man in a white coat with the label
"doctor" and other pictures, such as a man
who was an “engineer”. and perhaps a
woman who would be a “teacher.” This at-
titude is changing. shc maintained. Now,
through the Education Supply House,
teachers "arc able to get pictures of women,
and also of minorities engaged in various oc-
cupations." These ncw role models arc “sub-
tlc hints that let the younger children know
that tltcy have different carccrs opcncd to
them." she said.

Ramale said that when she spoke with

young wotncrt at tile high school level. “they
are surprised that tltcrc is an issue at
all...Whal they want to know is “How do
they do it?" But young women also realize
that the female still gets the majority of the
household chores as her rcsponsibility.said
Ramalcy.

Thcrc arc otltcr problems to cope with,
citing pregnancy as an example. she said that
when a woman goes back to active scientific
research after having a baby. she loses touch
with what is going on in tile field. When she
returns tltc woman must "retool" and catclt
up on the ttcw ideas. Ramttlcy saitlJn addi-
tion to the physical problem of not bcittg in
tottclt with new ideas. tltcrc is still tltc attitude
problem of many pcoplc.“ln our socicty.
when you have a career you have to show
that you arc fully dedicated-you have to pro-
yc that you are scrious. such as working over-
time." said Ratnalcy. “Women who want to
work on a career on a part-timc basis are
criticizcd for ttot hcing scriotts," she added.

Rantalcy said that many univcrsilics arc
not t'cccptivc to hiring part-time women
teachers who are raising children. It is harder
for a woman to teach part-time in order to
raise a family titan for a woman to teach
part-timc because she already has another
career. she said.

Ratnalcy continued, saying that it had bccn
“acceptable for women to work for
ccunomic ncccssity, bttl not bccausc titcy lov-
cd their careers."

Ramalcy, who serves on various govern-
ment and scientific committees. said she sees
tnorc wotttcn scientists applying for grants.
She also feels that this is "cvidcncc for the
growing number of women in the scientific
fields." More women are doing research
work as “indcpcndcnt scicntists" as well. she
statcd. .

Ramalcy feels that thc grcalcsl change over
Iltc ycars is that women arc now able to be
“passionate about their carccrs. they know
that tltcy have a contribution to make, and
they arc pcrtnittcd to inch their time and
cnct'gy into their carccr." '
