"Our parties are campus-wide.
We get guys that just hang out at
kegs and drink. we had a ﬁght go-
ing on... as far as having a security
system. there were too many peo-
ple." Harrison said.

According to Abelow. he resign- '
ed on Sunday. March 11 and was
informed the next day by Longen-
dyke that he was being referred. “I
wanted to show that it had nothing
to do with Quad Board. I had told
Alan I resigned before I got refer-
red," he said.

, Abelow received a letter Monday.
March 19 from Longendyke which
described the events of the party.
' Abclow said. The letter stated that
as the party progressed there were
problems with its management. and
that .thc I‘lagroom was packed
beyond capacity. Ahelow added.

“i think tltat letter wottld never >

we sltottld have shot tlte doors (to
keep more people from coating in).
People would have crawled through

“I guess Alan (Lottgendyke) was

“The Blue Light Phones (result)
were kind of surprising,“ Knot‘r
said. adding that the phones are not

Schaffer.

"I think that Alan should have
maybe dealt with Quad Board at a
personal level. They're trying to
make an example of Ross. 1 think
Ross has done a lot for the quad.
The benefits of referring him are
not there. too many minuses go
along." he added. ‘

Schaffer said, “The party was
ok. It did get a little crowded but
the people on State Quad have
nowhere else to go. I think they
tried to blow up the situation.“

When reached for comment,
Martone said he had “no
comment" on the issue.

Assistant Dean of Residential

Life John Murphy was not aware‘

that Abelow was being referred.
and said he was not itt a position to
discuss the case.

Longendyke said. "We are not
supposed to discuss this." when
reached for comment. Abelow said

he was told by 'Longendyke that “it
was Residential Life policy not to
talk to the ASP.” .

Abelow is being referred oh the
charge of violation of Section 7, 13
and 17 of the Student Guidelines.
The regulations prohibit “knowing-

1y furnishing false information to -'

the University. failure to comply
with policies or reguations govern-
ing the registration of
student...events. and violation of

University regulations governing.

the use of alcoholic beverages."

According to PoguerAlbany city
law requires that a group serving
alcohol must have a liquor permit
“displayed conspicuously” because
of the open container law. “There
are a couple of occasions where
students are allowed to have a party
without a permit." Pogue said.
“The city will probably not take ac-
tion against the students," he add-
ed.
