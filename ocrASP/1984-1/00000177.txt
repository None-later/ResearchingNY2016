New York, NY
(COLLEGE PRESS _ SERVICE) “Top
caliber“ college grads apparently
have turned down enough low-level
and middle-level management job
offers recently to cause some
employers to worry about a “mid-
management vacuum” during the
next few years, an employment con-
sulting firm says. .

In “an informal phone study of
50 of our corporate clients."
Goodrich and Sherwood Co.. a

New York consulting firm, found
the corporations are having trouble
convincing some graduating seniors
to accept jobs that may take them
to factories in non-metropolitan
areas, may leave them with I‘too
many bosses" over them, or that
threaten to conflict with “favored
lifestyles." explained Jack Gow.
Goodrich and Sherwood’s pttblie
relations consultant. “Most of
these guys." Gow said, "want to

start at the top, and then work tip ila

little higher."

 

Gow sayshis tirm's clients —
which he describes as “all Fortune
500 companies" —- are finding even
higher salaries aren't luring top
grads to jobs “at plants in
geographic areas where they can‘t
go sailboating or golﬁng or skiing."

The only cotnpanics not "finding
it difﬁcult to take these mid-
tnanagemcnt jobs that are now
opening again," Gow pointed ottt,
are sortie high-tech industries.
“High tcclt is the glamour industry

somewhere; he commented. “But
we got the students down there once
and they thought they were all
through," said Tierney.

The legislators did not like it
when they were pressed with that
number of stttdents flooding the ol-
l'iccs according to Tierney. “If a
legislator was for the tttition hike
last year he did not like 3,000
students pressuring him to elituinatc
it." said Tierney.

This year SASU has taken a dif-
l‘crent approach and it is conceit-
trating on consistent lobbying
pressure, according to Tierney.
“We are going down tltis year with
smaller groups on a consistent basis
and who are knowledgeable and
forceful," said Tierney.

Even though SA President Rich
SCIltIITL‘I‘ commented tltat he cott-
sidcrcd last year’s mass lobbying cl-
l'cctivc “...those 3,000 students
cottld go to the polls," he admitted
that tltcrc scented to be a sense ol~
ineffectiveness when it was all over.
“I turned arottnd to Mike (.‘nrso
and said, ‘so now what do we do."'

it was dil'ﬁcult to keep it sustain- '

ctl interest by the students, accor-
ding to Schal‘l'cr. “You got people
excited to go all ottt one day but
there was no follow-up," he said.
Last June tltc question was raised
by Schal‘l'cr and SASU as to
whether the student lobbying ap-
ptoaclt should bc changed. Schal'l'cr
said that it was decided that if they
could get 5-6 students to sit down

'with lcgisltttors. especially students

who were ‘intclleclttally' inl‘ormcd
it could he more effective. Another
risk with the mass lobbying ap»
proach. said Schal'l'cr, is that there
is a possibility that no one would
show up; “we would look like
idiots." said Scltal'l'cr.

Still another problctn with the
mass inl'lttx ot"stttdcnts to the
legislature last year, according to
Schal'l'cr. was educating students
about what they were faced “illl
and the specific issues the) “CH!
lobbying about. “of Ihc J,t)t)tl
students thctc we might lnnc had
100 that really knew the specifics oi

legislators and its \llt'll the

not want to pay tnore to attend
SUNY, commented Schal‘t‘cr.

A total ol'SlZ.3 million was spent
in l983 by groups lobbying the state
lcgislatttre itt Albany, according to
Schum. This was a 28 percent in-
crease l'rom the previous year when
$9.6 million was reported to have
been spent, he said.

This increase is the rcsttlt of a
tnore aggressive program by the

 

commission to seek out
unregistcrcd lobbyists, according to
Submit. Once a lobbying concern
reaches a $2,000 threshold on spen-
ding. it is mandatory for them to
register with the NYS Commission
on Lobbying and efforts to identify
unregistered lobbying concerns are
made by talking to the legislators
inquiring what groups have ap-
proached them. he said. [D

now." he explained, "like plastics
was 20 years ago."

Despite companies' cotnplaints,
other officials who help place
students in jobs after graduation
haven‘t noticed students turning
down many'job offers.

“l'tn not aware of that ltappen-
ing," said Linda Pcngilly of the
College Placement Council, a
Bethlehem. Pa., association of
campus placement officers from
around the country. “It could be
that it's not happening, or it could
be that it is happening and people
juSI haven't started grumbling
about it," she said. <

in its tnosl recent survey, released
in October, the CPC “found just
the opposite," she pointed out.
“Students were accepting recruiting
offers earlier in the year" to allay
the insecurities of the recessionary
job market.

Pcngilly said SPS's hard date
about this year's job market won’t
be available until late March.

Students haven't been turning
down jobs in at least one rural area.
