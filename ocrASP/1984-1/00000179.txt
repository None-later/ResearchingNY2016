tion. But the Albany State men‘s in-
door track team gave Illcir best ef-
fort. just ‘as they have all season.
The Irttckttleu finished eighth of tile
23 teams participating. totaling 33
points in the two-day cotnpctitiott
lteld at Hamilton College lttst l-‘ri-
day and Saturday. The tncet winner
was Fredonia Statc'with 129 points

52 points. The Danes once again
beat out area-rival attd ninth—place
finisher Ri’l. as well as fourteenth-
place Uttiott.

his team: "The great thing that sets
this season attd this team apart is
the all-out effort they give every

They've got pride. and this season
has been one they can be proud
of." ‘ i .

in his heat by blasting Ihrouglt the

Surprises worked both ways in‘

the 1.500-mctcr run. In the semi—

“Everybody was holding back so

Erwin spotted the stratagem too
late. He took over at 440mcters and
began to force the pace. btit soon
thereafter. RPI's Scott LcMay
moved up and impeded Erwin il-
legaly. forcing him off the inside of

also supported an increase in TAP
funding.

The announcement came attcr
legislative leaders had been meeting
for several weeks on Cuomo's pro-
posal, according to Anderson’s
press secretary Dick Matthew. “It is
his intention and the assembly’s in-
tention not to increase tuition.” he
added. Matthew noted that the
budget details are still being worked
on and that complete ﬁgures will be
coming out in a “day or two."

Neither Fink nor his press
secretary Dave Langdon could be
reached for comment.

“Things are looking very good,"
said President for the Student
Association of the State University
(SASU). Jim Tierney. He added
that the statements by the two
leaders are "top budget priorities.”
He noted that the ﬁnal budget will
not be passed until April 3.

Tierney praised the lobbying cf-
forts of students from across the
SUNY system. saying. “Students
kicked in and pushed hard." In-
formed students havc been lobbying
legislators in groups of fifty since
Cuomo proposed his budget

court allow him to display the posters, and
that they establish a committee to clarify the
election regulations.

The sequence of events leading up to the
banning of McCann's poster is under dispute
by almost everyone involved.

“The poster isn't up yet." said McCann.
“There is no legitimate way" Busby could
have seen it. contended McCann. “He's just
going on the word of other people," McCann
said. “Busby was approached by several peo-
ple who told him the poster was slanderous."
McCann continued.

Busby concurred that he did not see the
poster prior to banning it. “I asked Bill (Mc-
Cann) what it said. and he read it to me,"
over the telephone. Busby explained.

According to McCann, however, Busby in-
.g formed him that the poster would be banned.
and McCann then told him what was on it.

Busby said be banned the poster because

NYPIRG project coordinator
Paul Herrick said that he was "real

is not going to happen this year. He
added that he was pleased with the
success of the student lobbying. He
noted that the better organization
and smaller groups helped. saying
that. “this is the way NYPIRG ltus

Election Regulations). If it said ‘We need

“There is some question" in the election
