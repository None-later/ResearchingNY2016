"The university has a responsibility. ”

.SA demands university
pay back classes’ money

By Christine Refielt
smrr warren

The classes of I984-7 are each
demanding a $3.000 reimburse-
ment frotn the SUNYA ad-
ministration to replace voluntary
class fees not solicited on student
bills for the fail I983 semester, ac-
cording to Student Association of-
ticials.

Last fall. explained SA Presi-
dent Rich Schafl‘cr. the university
‘

would be “inappropriate to offer
any further comment at this time,
because of tire potential legal
aspect of the issue."

The first semester. according to
Schaffcr. SA worked with the
university to recover tlte money.
in the spring billing a notice was
attached, citing the mistake and
inviting students to pay their class
dues.

The

revenue obtained, said

“We just want the classes to
get the money owed to
them. ”

—Rt'ch Schaffer

neglected to offer students the op-
portunity to pay their class clues.
costing each class an estimated
$3.000.

SA has filed a notice of claim
against the university and the

1' state, according to SA attorney
Mark Mishlcr. This. Mishlcr said.
gives SA more time to decide
whether or not they will file suit if
the university does not replace the
funds.

Schaffer emphasized that "the
university has a responsibility to
the classes to do this. We are not
interested in fighting the universi-
ty." ltc said. "we just want the
classes to get the money owed to
them."

“The university is liable for any
mistakes,“ explained Schaffer.

Director of Campus Life Jim
Docllefeld said Thursday that he
had not received any notice of
claim yet. and therefore felt it

Campus

Schaffer. “was minimal, because
the notice did not get much of a
response." He added, “The
university should be aware of the
claim soon. Right now we are all
waiting for 'ya_ response." The
claim was filed last week.

“We are not suing tltc universi-
ty," Sehaffer stressed. Instead, lte
said. he hopes to get in contact to
meet with the administration to
find a way to get back the money.

The university has an agreement
with the students to put these op~
tional fees on the semester bills,
Misltler said. .

The voluntary fees are re-
quested from students. faculty.
and friends of the university ac-
cording to a written agreement
with SUNYA.

The tltree dollar fee is an op-
tional fee. Misltler said. However,
“a lot of students do choose to
pay the fee.“ he added. 1 i

Although strides have been made towards fairer
laws, rape statutes in New York are still biased
against victims. according to Margaret Clemens, a
student at Albany Law School. ~-

Clemens. who spoke at a Women's Studies Collo-
quium Wednesday afternoon. pointed out that in
1975 there were only 17 convictions for rape in the‘
slate. out of 2.000 reported rapes.

The reason for such a low ﬁgure. she said. was
because the law rcqttircd that witnesses see the actual
attack occur. “They didn't believe a woman,"
Clemens explained. The rule was abolished in l975.

New York is one of two states that still requires
corroborration when a rape victim is ttnder 17, but
Cletttctts said the legislature is expected to vote on a
bill that would abolish the rule this week.

Such laws, Cletnens said. were “left-over for the
sense that a woman's testimony on rape was not
trusted."

Until two years ago. Clemens noted. state law re-
quired that women "earnestly resist their attacker for
it to be rape." The attitude of many lawmakers and
judges was that if a woman couldn’t show that
(resistance) she must have enjoyed it." Clemens said.

"Tire rape' laws were never originally ‘ ' to
protect women from violent crime." she stressed.
The laws regarding rape were based on common law,
where a wife was considered property, she said.

Clemens, a graduate of SUNYA's Womcns
Studies Program, addressed the crowd of 25 people,
all but 2 of them female. and asserted that lawyers
can and do make implications dttring a trial that have
no bearing on the actual assault. For example.
Clemens said. questions are raised as to the victim‘s
past. how ntueh she'd had to drink. did she “want
it." and did. she say “no” when she meant "yes."
Such fallacies, she said. still influence courts.

“By definition in New York you cannot’be raped
by your husband, " Clemens said when asked by an

" member about marital rape.

She said there were two theories behind the law's
reason; first, that women consented to sexual rela-
tions when they became married. or second, women
are property, and. Clemens said, it is argued that if a
man cannot steal his own property how can he r'ape
his own wife?

"9‘lt'sounds like they’rejustifications from the past.
bttt it‘s still there." she added.

Marital rape is especially difficult to prosecute
because a woman mttst prove force was used by the
husband. she explained.

in addition, a ltusband will know when his wife
will be alone or when the neighbors are away, so
I there are rarely witnesses. she said. '

Clemens added that Florida was a national leader
in marital rape laws because several well-publicized
parlicttlarly brutal marital rapes occurred over the

past few years. '

in New York, Clemens said. a man can be pro-
secuted for marital rape only if a couple is living
apart by court order and the husband has signed an
agreement that lie can be prosecuted for the crime.
“By definition you‘re not female ifyou're married in
'thv York." she said.

Margaret Clemens ~
Rape fallacies slill inf/trance courts. I
Rape laws should be designed across the country in
such a way that victims do not have to prove they
fought back and were then overpowered by the at-
tacker. Laws should “put the burden on what did the
person do. not what was the response." she said.
Clemens asked tire audience if this was fair since
no resistance on the victims part is required for an
assailant to be tried for robbery, tnugging, or assault

‘ cases.

Race. said Clemens. is another problctn because of
prejudices against black and minoritywomen.

One member of the audience suggested the state
delete all laws about rape from its books and treat all
cases as if they were assault crimes.

Clemens said that a few states had already done
that. but that it is too early to jttdge the results. "l'm
not sure what it's going to come down to in a few
years when they've been on the books. it might be the
way to go." she said.

“A” Woman 's'  ‘
testimony on' rape
was not truste ”

—Margarel Clemens

 

A big problem, Clemens noted. was that “most
women don’t have access to information unless they
call a rape crisis center." She said a woman, if
assaulted and raped. should get medical help before
showering so that no evidence would be destroyed.

Several workers from area rape crisis centers said
that all area medical facilities are equipped with rape
evidence kits. but only a few hospitals will ask a
woman if she wants to speak with a rape crisis
counselor or report the incident to police. [1

 

 

cOalition sought for registration drive

 

  

Project coordinator Paul Herrick
>N YPIRG is working Infaeililale registration.

RACHEL LITWIN UPS

By Jon Wlllmott
smrr WRITER

in an attempt to force legislators
to respond to the needs of the silent
majorities. the SUNYA chapter of
the New York Public interest
Research Group (NYPlRG) is driv-
ing to register more of the com-
munity’s young people. women,
and minOrities to vote.

NYPIRG is also seeking to form
a coalition ofcarnpus organizations
to create a chapter of tire National
Student Campaign for Voter
Registration according to Jane
Hawkslcy, NYPIRG voter registra-
tion project coordinator and
chapter secretary.

Hawkslcy said NYPIRG is work-
ing with 30 community health,
social and human service organiza-
tions itt an effort to register two to
three thousand rttore voters dttritrg
the spring arid summer and will
concentrate on student registration
attd voting in the fall.

NYI’lRG legislative reprcscn~
tative Brenda McMahon testified
before the .loint Senate and
Assembly Election Law Commit-
tees on voter registration. She

 

stressed student voting rights, on-
eampus polling places and voter
registration grants. She cited a
grant 'program in ldalto, which paid
50 cents to registrars for every new
voter registered door to door. This
incentive resulted in a 90' percent
registration rate of ldaho's voting
age population.

She also cited the cumbersome
absentee ballot system. mail
registration. the printing of registra-
tion forms in newspapers, and elec-
tiort day registration. Claiming that
registration up to and including
election day increases turnout. sltc
noted Minnesota- which ltas im-
plcntented this system, as having a
7l.9 percent turnout, which is well
above the national rate. Currently.
in New York State, one must
register 30 days prior to election
day.

NYPlRG is working to facilitate
registration by attaching instruction
streets to the forms and placing
them ill community outreach
centers‘sttch as the Trinity lnstittt-
tion, Jewish Community Center,
YWCA attd many of the area
hospital‘s outpatient service offices

said NYPIRG project coordinator
Patti Herrick.

They will also be helping
residents at the Good Samaritan
Lutheran Home v rth their absentee
forms. as well as having a table dur-
ing Career Day at the Capital
DiStrict Educational Opportunity
Center. according to Lori Sing of
NYPIRG Community Service.

Hawkslcy'said the. project has
had good response and that it is
really starting to come together.
Campus organizations involved in
the project include the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance (GALA) and the
Yottng Democrats. Site also noted
the possibility of summer intern-
ships which would be availablc for
work on the project.

According to NYPIRG. if you
haven't voted itt four years, or ltave
moved. you ntust rc-rcgister. This
even inclttdcs a move on-campus,
and Hawksley advised coming up to
the NYl'lRG office in the Campus
Center if students have any ques-
tions. Site also- stressed that the
deadline for regiStration for the
November elections is October 6. El
