Schaffer says Pogueplans to OK

By Ian Clements
EDI TORIA I. ASSISTANT

Student Assodution President
Rich Sehaffer announced at
Wednesday's Central Council
meeting that Vice President for Stu-
dent Affairs Frank

Pogue will not centfal

recommend that

kegs be banned '

from campus counc"
suites.

Poguc refused to confirm what
Schaffcr said. Poguc said that he
would not discuss his policy recom-
mendation until after he has given
his proposal to University President
Vincent O'Lcury. _

Schaffer said that Poguc changed
the proposal following a meeting of
the Student Affairs Council, a
University Senate committee.
Pogue’s original proposal allowed
beer balls. but not kegs in dorm
rooms.

According to Scltal‘fcr, the stu-
dcnt. faculty anti administrative
members of tile Council asked
Poguc to allow kegs in dorm rooms.
One professor. said Schaffcr. men-
tioned that the University does not
Interfere in faculty offices and
therefore sllould not interfere in
sludents‘ rooms.

Poguc said that he would not
comment on the alcohol policy
“out of rcspcct to" O'Leary and
because “that is the way (Poguc
feels) about doing things."

Council also passed two major
pieces of Icgislatiorr at the meeting.
A new Constitution. which requires
the approval of twenty percent of
the entire student body to become
lllc law of Student Association, was
approved. and an interview policy
for the hiring of SA workers was
passed.

Students will approve or reject
the new Constitution whcn it is the
subject of ti referendum to be held
in April. If passed. it will rrol ttlkc
effect until tllc 1985-86 school )‘Cill'.
Council members were asked by

Shapiro to sit on dinner lines It) ex-
plain the proposed new Constitu-
tion to -.ttttlcnls. SA cannotlt cum-
pttigll ill [tool of Illc proposed new
Constitution. stud Council chuir
Iioh llcll'rock.

According to Alrttnni (_)uud
t‘cpt'c-rcntttlivc Stc\c Russo. who
scucd oil the Constitution Commit-
tee along with it httlf dozen other
Council tnclllbcrs. at new Constitu-
tion was \\l'illL‘lI because the present

document. which was passed in
1973. is outdated. "ullatncnduhlc.“
and too lengthy.

It is outdated. he said. because it
refers to groups which no longer ex—
isl. That is also one reason why he

considers it too long. It is tlnamcn-

dtlhlc. Ilc said. because it requires a
vote of twenty percent of total
students ill order to be amended.
Since SA elections don't :lllruct
much student participation and
many students are unfamiliar with
the Constitution, amendment pro~
postlls do not pass. Russo noted.

The new Constitution would be
nearly half Illc length of tllc present
one. It specifies the duties of the
vice president. whereas the present
Constitution only vaguely defines
the duties of that position. It gives
him/her control over SA program-
ming. but allows him/her to up-
point an assistant to handle pro.
gramming duties. Currently. a pro-
gramming director handles those
responsibilities and reports to tile
president.

Other changes include: spccil‘ictl-

tion of the Supreme Court justlce’s
term. (a justice remains in office for
his/her academic life at SUNYA);
Council’s override of a presidential
veto, (the same amount of votes
needed to pass legislation will also
be required to override tr veto) and a
new amendamcnt policy (two-thirds
of the students who vote in SA elec-
tions must approve amendments).

The Constitution proposal was
passed Zl-l-O.

Interview Policy

The interview policy establishes
committees which will either rccom~
mend applicants. write lists of
available applicants or hire ap-
plicants for SA jobs.

Th interview policy is especially
concerned with affirmative action.
In its general statement, it pledges
“to provide equal opportunity as
well as to prohibit discrimination
because of age. race. color. disabili-
ty. religion, sexual preference.
gender or national origin."

According to SA Minority Al'-
fairs Coordinator Vivian Vazquez.
the interview policy was drawn up
in response to a controversy which
occurred earlier this semester when
students were interviewed for Con.-
tact Office positions.

Some students had been inter-

  

viewed under a rating system which
gave bonus points to disadvantaged
groups. while otllcrs had been inter-
viewed when the system was not in
effect. ' ,

But Hclbock disagreed. He men-
tioned that the problems began last
semester when a controversy
developed over the hiring of an off-
cumpus coordinator. Some off-
campus students had criticized the
selection proccdllrc for the position
at a Council nlccting held last
September. They said that students
had not been given ctlough little to
apply for the job.

Council approved
lB-l-Z. '

Schaffcr also announced that SA
is considering tr lawsuit against the
University to compensate students
who had possessions stolen froln
their dorm rooms during the in-
Icrscssion.

In addition. Scltal'fcr said that
the head of tile State Liquor
Authority is reviewing the
Alcoholic Beverage Controls. One
proposal under consideration.
Schaffer said. would allow SA to
purchase it yearly alcohol permit.
Currently. each time that an SA
l'ttndcd organization sponsors an
event at which alcohol is served it
must secure a permit. Iii]
