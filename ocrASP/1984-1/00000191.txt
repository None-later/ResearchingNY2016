Ditrer Klotz nails All-American honors at NCAAs

Sophomore is first Dane swim team
member to achieve such status

By Dean Chang

EDI YURI/l L ASSISTA N T

To attain the lofty stattts of All-American-

would require a combination of talent, hard
work and determination. Going into the Na-
tionals lteld at Emory University in Atlanta.
none of the five women nor tlteir coach of
Albany State's women's swim team expected
tltat much front themselves. The Nationals
would be a solid learning experience for the
groups. and would improve them for next
year. Tltat was the thinking until diver Jane
Klou proved everyone wrong and became the
first tnetttber of art Albany swim team (men’s
or women's) to become an NCAA All-
American. ’ .

Klotz ﬁnished ninth of 28 divers competing
in the three-meter dive; the top i2 finishers
became All-Americans. The sophomore from
nearby Burnt Hills didn't expect to finish in
the top l2. despite her first-place finish at the
recent SUNYACs. But after her five
preliminary dives in the first round. she
realized that what was once thought impossi-
ble. was now easily within reach.

Those dives put Klotz in fifth place. hardly
the position that she envisioned herself being
in. “When i found out that l was in ﬁfth. l

was really surprised." said Klotz. "When
they (her teammates) told me. I had to go
check for myself." .

Her position was a little misleading; the
top four divers were far ahead while Klotz led
a tightly bunched gioup of four that were
separated by only l0 points. One poor dive
and Klotz could ltave easily fallen several not-
ches. “There were three or four really good
divers tltat no one else could touch." said
Head Coach .ioe Shore. "The rest of them
were all pretty even."

Although the standings surprised Klotz. it
did not make her nervous. “The only time
that l was nervous was when i came to my
first practice down there." said Klotz. “i
couldn’t do any of my dives then, but i got
used to the surroundings."

The scmilinal round of three dives was
held the next morning as the top 24 divers
continued in the competition. it would be
understandable if Klotz approached the rest
of her dives in a conservative manner. but no
such action was forthcoming. Klotz stuck
with her original routine and ended up ninth
after the semifinal round. making her one of
l6 divers that advanced to the finals.

 

UPS

Jane Klotz became the first All-
American Dene swimmer.

The final round of three dives was held

later that night, and Klotz was confident that

she would succeed. "I wasn't too impressed

with the competition." said Klotz. “I
thought they were going to be better. As the
evening went on. i realized that I was going
to make it."

As it turned out. Klotz was correct. She
held her ground to finish ninth overall and
gained the immediate respect of those around
her. Said Shore. “Jane concentrated on the

three ntctcr and worked at it all year. With
diving coach Jim Scrbalik helping her.'she
really came through."

The group traveled to Atlanta by plane and
arrived on a Wednesday morning. The
weather was typical of a Southern city:
warm. sunny and inviting; appropriate for
the light-hearted bunch. “It was like a mini-
vacation." said freshman Carole Elie. “We
got in Atlanta and it was beatttifttl. I had a
good.time."

The meet began the next day for Albany.
as senior Janet Bowman participated in the
l00-yard butterlly. She finished 19th out of
34 entries with a time of l:0l.68. The
22-year-old was completing her first year of
swimming since high school, and having
reached the Nationals was an achievement in
itself.

The following day saw the successful
ZOO-yard freestyle relay team of Bowman.
Elie. Kris Monahau and Carol Pearl finish a
respectable 18th out of 26 teams in a time of
1:443. “They did as well as they could." said
Shore. "Their best just wasn't good enough
for them to win." ‘

Despite failing to achieve All-American
stattts. the women weren't disappointed.
“We weren't out there to place." said Elie.
“We just went to have the experience of be-
ing in the Nationals. We got a chance to see a
lot of good swimmers. and it's good to watch
people. i got a lot out of seeing their

Bailey and Armstrong: Two all-around athletes

 

IOI LUCK“ UPS

 

Karen Bailey etrute her stuff on the balance beam. She and Brenda Armstrong

repreeented Albany State It the NOW.

 
 

By John F. Parker

if youth. consistency. ﬂexibility and
maturity are what you're looking for in a
gyutnast. then look no furtlter than Universi-
ty Gym where you'll find Albany State‘s
Karen Bailey artd Brenda Armstrong going
through attotltcr day‘s long. grttcling
workout. These two dedicated athletes were
Albany's representatives at the NCAA
Eastern Regional championships and were a
big factor in the great successes of the
[983-84 Great Danes women’s gymnastics
program.

Although both are only sophomores. their
performances would indi 'ate a lot more.
They are the last of a dying breed. the “all-
around“ gymnast. in a world where
specializtion ltas taken over virtually every
aspect of life. including gymnastics. the all-
aronnd competitor's dedication is rarely sur-
passed.

As Albany's coach Pat Duval-Spillane put
it. Karen Bailey is a girl with "an abundance
of talent. an instinct for hard work. and a
future filled with plenty of promise." A high
school stand-out at East Minora High in
Syracuse. Bailey has developed immensely
since coming to the University at Albany. She
had a tremendous second season that con-
sisted of many record-breaking feats.

The accounting major's first memorable
mark was recorded at King's College when
she set the all-time Albany State record for
the vault with a score of 8.45. The record was
not merely surpassed. but shattered. and we
may see the same thing happen again in her
years to come. At the University of Vermont.
her l'loor execisc routine scored an 8.65.
breaking the old school record. Although her
uneven parallel bar and balance beam
routines may not have set records. they are
nothing to laugh at either.

Bailey's highest all-around score for the
season was 32.2. just 0.] off Elaine Giynn's
record mark set last season. That fact in-
dicates that if a major weakness exists. it has
thus far gone undetected. Bailey was ranked
sixteenth in the state in the all-around com-
petition and eighteenth in the floor exercise.

Guildcrlaad Central High School's varsity
gymnastic team was blessed for lch years
with Brenda Armstrong. The sophomore
from Altamont. New York was as good in
high school as she is in college. but on a less

sophisticated level. The four-time Adiron-
dack Region Empire State team member’s
consistency has just been phenomenal.

With a possible coaching or sports writing
career on the horizon. Armstrong becomes
tttorc attd tnore of an expert every day. Her
outstanding talent in all of tltc events finally
paid off this season.

The ttttcvctt parallel bars. possibly the
toughest event itt gymnastics today. is Arni-
strong‘s favorite evcnt. She set the ttll~timc
Albany record this year in the tttcct against
Westfield State by recording an impressive
8.3. She shared the . ason record on the
balance beam. with teammate Elicia
Steinbcrg. by registering an 8.05. More im—
portantly however. was her consistency itt
each event. wltich. in effect. brought lter the
most success.

 

“Both girls really
produced for us... ”
—— Pat Duvall—
Spillane

 

While ranking thirteenth in New York in
the vault. thirteenth on the balance beam.
and fifteenth on the bars, Armstrong was
able to finish ninth in the all-around competi-
tion's ratings. With so much space yet to be
conquered. it is no wonder that she is becom-
ing known as one of the best ever here at
Albany.

"Both girls really produced for us this year
and our expectations for next season will be
even higher. Hard work. innovation. and
creativity will all be keys to the amount of in-
creased success the girls will receive. Pressure
will certainly be on them. but 'l'm sure tltcy
will handle it as they usually do. like
winners,” commented the Albany State
coach.

Titcy ccrainly are winners and no one can
deny that. With plenty of mileage left to go.
these young competitors will defialtley be br-
inging even more recognition to Albany State
gymnastics. With all eyes upon them. Bailey
and Armstrong will continue to come
through. like the classy competitors they
are. ill

he be allowed to use the poster.

The Suprentc Court decided. in a
five to two vote. that the poster be
allowed.

The poster refers to internal
struggles reportedly taking place in
SA between SA President Rich
Schafi'cr and Vice President .lcfi‘

The poster reads “The Big Fight!
