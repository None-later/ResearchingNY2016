Despite the unusually high in-
cidence of the illness. health of-
ficials say no cpidcmic is probable.

“There‘s no reason to panic.“
cottnsclcd liarbttrtt McEndt'cc. ti
Norman nursing supervisor. "it’s
such an cttsily treatable discasc. and
there's tto reason to think it'll
sprctttl widely."

The students who had the active
cases ttlt'cttdy httd tuberculosis
before coming to the university.
said Dr. Lcc Lyon, director of
Oklahoma's Til screening clinic.
Most of the infected students,
moreover. were Southeast Asian.
Lyon stressed tltcrc's still a relative-
Iy high incidence of Ti! in Asia.

in the U.S.. the airborne
bacterial infection rate is one per-
son in 30.000. ()U‘s sltltlcttl populzt-_
