Zzzz.

Didn’t you know that if you’re a senior with the promise of a $10,000
careervorientcd job, you could have the American Express Card?

Where have you been?

Asleep?

Because for some time American Express has been saying that we believe
in your future. But even more than that. We believe in you now. And we’ve
been proving it. A $10,000 job. That’s it. No strings. No gimmicks. And this
offer is even good for 12 months after you graduate.

But why do you need the American Express Card now? First of all, it’s a
good way to begin to establish your credit history. And you know that’s
important. Of course, the Card is also good for vacation travel, as well as
for shopping for things like a new stereo or furniture. And because the Card
is recognized and welcomed worldwide, ﬂ '  
so are you. i '1 “

So call 800—528—8000 for a Special ' I
Student Application or look {or one at
your college bookstore or on your

   

       

campus bulletin boards. > > -' ' . .' . _
The American Express Card. Don’t ‘ . V. i‘ly
leave school without it.w i ﬁg , ‘ .
