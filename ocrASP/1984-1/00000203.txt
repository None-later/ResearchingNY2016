‘Failure of intellect’ root cause

B Suzanne Murphy
smt'r ll’RI'fL-‘Ii

United States foreign policy of-
ficittls did not succeed during the
Vietnam War because of “a
massive failure of intellect."
asserted SUNYA Professor Richard
Kendall. iii a speech Wednesday.

“The North Vietnamese Artny
(NVA) were ready. willing and able
to light our kind of war." explained
Kendall. who studied the Vietnam
War extensively dttring a recent
strbaticttl.

Kendall sttid that the war was
based on a large and abstract policy
of "containment of communism"
and rtrn by system analysts in

Washington. DC. rather than by
the military.

These "whiz kids." said Kendall.
believed that the Vietnam War
could be a “limited” war. “Victory
was never mentioned in connection
with Vietnam. They wanted to go
in. apply American force. and make
the NVA behave." he contended.

According to Kendall. it was not
a war in which the elite par-
ticipated. “Of the 2.6 million
troops sent to Vietnam. three-
quarters were nrcmbers of the low.
middle and working classes and
one-quarter were below the poverty
level." he asserted.

will leave SUNYA at the end of this

would be denied.

emphasis on publishing. Cocks has

his life itt the United States.

Kendall called the conﬂict an
“undeclared” war in which Con.
gress had little say. "General
William Westmorcland called it a
‘war of attrition.‘ This is a dead
end. it was not a strategy." he said.

"The military had no on ground
strategy... America used their
superior mobility (helicopters) to
find the NVA. to fix them. to fight
them. to beat them. and tltcn not to
do anything to follow them up."
said Kendall of the battles that
dominated 1966 through 1967.

“We adopted the kind of war. a

perfectly capable of fighting. They

'ding up at Albany in l97l where he

 

became involved in a new inter-
disciplinary department callcd the
Allen Center.

According to Cocks. the center

'taught junior and senior high

school students. stressing classes on
themes such as equnlity. The themes
were taught by bringing different
disciplines together to examine the
subjecr. Cocks contended the center
was before its time. As a result. he
said, the center was the first to go
during the budget cuts. “It was can-
'ned during the ﬁrst cuts because it
was non-traditional. The ad-
ministration said it was intangentiai
to the university. It was such a good
idea but faculty members were too
dumb to recognize this." he said.

After its closing. Cocks taught at

ironically because two of his col-
leagues hadn't re‘ceivcd tenure at
Albany because they had not
published adequately.

As he discussed his present iden-
tical situation Cocks’ relaxed tone
grew slightly tnore serious. “Tire
sad thing about this whole situation
is that you can be an extraordinarily
good teacher and not publish and
you don't get tenure. Yet. yott can
be it ltorriblc teacher who publishes
and gets tenure."

Cocks contends that the “publish
or perish" pressure which comes
from the administration is really
detrimental to students. “Univer

tltc war was “stnlctnating. The
system nttttlysls and intellectual arm
chair analysts who ran the war
found that it was not cost-effective.
By the cttd of t967. there was a
severe and debilitating loss of con-
fidence by those who managed the
war."

At the end of March. l968. when
President Lyndon B. Johnson an-
nounced that he would not rttn for
rc-clcclion. two billion dollars a
month were being spent on the war.
according to Kendall.

 

"There was no strategy to win
and no hope of using diplomatic
tactics. The war was not a signifi-
cant point in the l968 presidential
campaign. it became a matter of
disentangling ourselves from Viet-
narn." said Kendall.

According to Kendall. “There
are no lessons to be learned from
the Vietnam War. What does the
American military tltiuk of the Viet-
nam War? It is strictly and simply a
negative model. a check list of
things not to do."
