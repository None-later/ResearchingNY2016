As SA President. I will apply myself to
promoting tltc office as an active and
thoughtful student advocate. Utilizing a con-
ccrn for the functions of the University artd
city administrations. I will avoid placing
stress on issues. I will work to create respect
and power through responsible student ac-
tion. such as asking assistance in achieving
goals rather than demanding results.

—Wiltlam Jones

   
  

.
In order to foster student power. I iltl~
vocate a two ticr approach. The SA President
mrrst be instrumental in grassroots orgtttti/ing
while at the satttc tirnc serving as the students:
liason at all levels. An educated .student hath
contbincd with personalized lobbying will
gain respect. Additionally, the professional
approaclt of working within the
bureaucracies is necessary for contirured stu-
dent victories.

—Riclt Schut'fer

 

The SUNYA and City administrations are often accused of being
unresponsive to student needs. Considering last week’s successful
effort to reopen the Humanities Lounge, what other methods would
you, as SA President, employ to increase student power within the

City and University administratlons?

 

Success comes about only through deter-
ntination and a will to succeed. By familiariz-
ittg the SUNY student with his/her rights.
and r ' " g the student that past involve-
ment has brought about success (i.c.
Humanities Louttgc) I feel that the student
body cart become stronger than ever. It is
unity attd tt strong physical presence of

students that elicits positive responses.

~—Bill McCann

3 Amends made to SA

University Cinema Executive Board
members convicted last April of embezzling
$3.500 in SA funds have paid back the money
with the exception of $50 from director
William Braddock. according to SA con-
troller Adam Barsky.

The six board members served 15 days each
in Albany County jail. were placed on proba-
tion for three years. and were lined $1.000
each. In addition they were each required to
return $584 to SA.

As a result of the incident, changes were
tnade by SA for the handling of fttnds within
carnpous organizations. These changes pro-
vide a tighter reign on groups who handle
large amounts of money such as University
Cinemas and University Concert Board.
