they emphasize leaching but then
the University's ultimate reputa-
tion depends on publishing." Cocks
explained. “If you come here as a
junior faculty member you will be
strongly encouraged not to pay at-
tention to teaching. Students
become secondary consideration.
You have to worry about cranking
things out to get rewarded.“ _
ICocks said he enjoys writing btlt
not scholarly pieces which are writ—
ten for deadline. He contends that
teaching a class itself entails cons-
tant reading. researching and up-
dating. “A university shottld be a
place to give opportunities for peo-

. pie to teach."

Reclining in his chair. the Pro-
fessor returned to his gingerly lone

spoke about the King Center for
lltlll»\‘it)lL'lll social change. which
was founded atld dedicated to tile
continuation of ller father‘s work.
“The institute is_dedicatcd to his
legacy" she said. “it is true to his
spirit. and engaged ill continuing
his unfinished work. The thread

the need for expostttc attd utiIi/a-

Cocks stated. “I miss the English
Pubs. pubs are the social centers of
England."

The chief difference Cocks sees
between America and London is
America’s over riding. all-
encompassing capitalist system.
“America is really the only
capitalist country ill the world."
Cocks cites shopping malls as an ex-
ample of American capitalism cali-
ing them "palaces of
consumption."

"l’m fascinated by l'nalls. The
amazing thing about America is
that it is an extreme version of
society whose goals are the con-
sulnption of material commodities.
in England there has been am-
bivalence and hostility toward lil-

“The program combines e\-

has been unsuccessful as a modern
capitalist power." Cocks explained.
According to Cocks. in America a
person is offered more money to
work harder. In England. he said. a
person would rather be offered
more time off if they worked
harder.

Cocks said he is sad to leave

Albany but that he will go on__

teaching and not lose touch with his
friends here. in the meantime, the
Professor will continue to rush
around teaching international Rela-
tions by scribbling a huge outline of
mega-notes on the bluekboards. ad-
vising his students, reading new
books. researching new topics and
offering sometimes humorous.
sometintes serious insights into
American life to his followers. [7)

tcl'crcnce itl his stump speeches in
New York and Connecticut.

“Kinship struggle“

Jackson rcnntitlctl the calttlesl
throughout the debate.

Referring to Mondale and Hart.
Jackson said. “The rcasort they are
having this kind of kinship sttuggie
l.\ that there is such similarity ill
policies. it's a matter of botll going
ill the saute direction."

That littc dt'cw applause I'tottl lllc
audience. which encircled the
debaters.

At another point, Jackson talked
about his belief that providing jobs
for displaced American workers
was not enough wllcll U.S. corpora-
tiotls are willing to make their pro-
ducts overseas where wages are
lower.

“Jobs are not enough. even for
minorities  In slavery everybody
ltad a job." Jackson said.

Mondale spent much of his Illllt.‘
charging liat't witll inconsistency oil
his Senate record on arms control.
on tile Chrysler Corp. bailout. and
on the windfall profits ta.\ proposed
by Reagan and approved by the
Congress.

Energy policy discussed

Mondale said llart votetl with
“big oil" with tile Colorado senator
t'etorting “he knows better than
that." '

Mondale said that during tllc
Carter administration Hart was one
of only eight Senate Democrats who
voted against a windfall profits no
lie said would have taken a quartet
of a trillion dollars in excess profits
from major oil companies.

“The issue we are talking about is
w by you voted togivc tl quarter of a
trillion dollars to big oil." Mondale
silltl to lltlrt.

"i did not. strapped llarl.

“Oh yes. you did." said Motl—
dale.

n

“i didn't vote.“ llart began to
reply. interrupted by Motldalc who
then said. “Somehow then the Coll-
gt'cssiotlal Record is wrong because
you‘re tccot'dcd as otlc of eight
Democrats to transfer a quarth ol tt
trillion dollars...“

“That was not the \otc atld you
know it wasn‘t.“ rctortcd Hull.
Hall said he favored a different.
tougher plan.

Mondale said it was clltttttctet istic
of Hart to support something
broader but withhold ittlpoltatlt
vote when tllc vote was needed.

Clash over nuclear units

All three candidates said tllc
Rcagatl administration was not
committed to arms control.

“He believes that an arms race
leads to arms talks." Mondale said
of Hart. “What he‘s plovcn is that
all arms race leads to all arms
race."

SUNY‘ Board of Trustees hearing

"SUNY must recognize women's
safety as a rlght. not a privilege. of

all women associated with the,

University." Mahar asserted.

Wharton said that he would like
to see safety inlprovemnts for both
females and males in the future.
However. Wharton said. Public
Safety personnel is critically low at
this time and that ntttst be address-
cd first.

SASU president Jim Tierney.
who attended the Board meeting.
said later that the South Africa in-

vestment problem will not be solved
easily.

SASU is in opposition lo the ill-
\'csttnents attd would like to see
divestiture of all funds. Tierney
maintained. However. due to con.
I'licts of interest within tllc Board of
Trustees. Tierney said. previous at-
tempts at divestitllrc have failed.

For example. Tierney noted that
Wharton sits on both the SUNY
iioard of Trustees and the lloartl of
Directors for the Ford Motor Com-
pany. which has business interests
in South Africa. l ‘

activities. as well as the cost of the
van to provide transportation. Lake
said. Each event is designed to give
the disabled a larger taste of the
world. For these plans to take
place. however. Wildwood needs
assistants to aid. chaperonc. and
sttport the students. so the motley
will also be used to train volunteers.
as well as recruit new workers. The
Telethon donation should help the

Wildwood projmect not only in
1984, btlt for many years to come.

Lake added that the children who
attend Telethon enjoy tlle shows.
and that the help Telethon offers is
not just financial.
