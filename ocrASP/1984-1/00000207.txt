Don’t Ask Me Why???

80 [said to the man with the funny looking hat,

As though I were truly concerned for his health.

"The sign points in the other direction"

But he kept on walking as though I were non-existent.

[pondered for quite sometime, trying to figure
out why he pretended to hear me. ‘
After a few moments, [felt a tap on my shoulder.
[ turned around and saw that it was the same man
[ had seen before.
He looked as though he had been crying,
But he was solemn in his composure.

[ wanted to say something comforting,

But there was nothing to be said.

For it may not have been the right way he was going,
But it was the only way he ever knew.

C’est Moi
Ta—‘Dal

Welcome to Aspects first, though hopefully not last (though
hopefully my last) contest issue. Phew! Tiring work.

Just for anybody out there who's wondering how the winners for
this issue were picked. let me explain now. in hopes of staving off
the hordes of angry writers headed my way with “shovels and
rakes and implements of destruction," that a total of five people
looked over the entries in this contest — myself. and my associate
Steve Marks, as well as David Laskin, Patty Mitchell, and Tom
Kacandes. who are all on the masthead if anybody out there really
cares enough to look for them.

Naturally. since the writing submitted was generally of such high
quality. the decision of what won Was a tough one. We eased the
pain of these decisions by filling the issue with honorable mentions
for poetry ( which we recieved a lot of). since the competition was
so fierce. There were also honorable mentions in the other
categories. but we're saving them for another time (wicked
chuckle.)

* Anyway, it is now five o'clock in the morning. and we’re wrapp-
ing up. so I'm going to wrap this up. too. Congratulations to all the
winners. for the quality of the competition surprised me. consider-
ing the fact that both the Albany Review and Nadirjust finished ac-
cepting submissions a couple of days ago. It's nice to think that the
writers of this school think enough of Aspects to respond to a con-
test like this one. i
