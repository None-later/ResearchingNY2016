Away In a transverse planet
lightened.
A star nearer than its

counterpart
wavering in a gray doom
demeaning area
And staring back into
the light of the gaze.
Nearing, strengthening, winning.
To wonder.
Looking into —— seeing deep
vertical, horlzontal
lines, seeping into
existence
Reaching in the dark to
retain perceptivity
There in the haze — quick
darting — .
behind a moonbeam,
And is gone.
