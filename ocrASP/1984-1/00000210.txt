Thc filial qucslion at hand seems to be: who should bear
the increased costs of maintaining our university? As a
publicly funded university We expect the state government
(i.e.. the state tax payers) to shoulder at least some of this in-
crease. However, i also suspect that a steadfast refusal by the
students to also hear sonic of the burden is not likely to curry
favor either in the state legislature nor in the households
across the state. The economic realities are that both the State
and the individual tax payers are already struggling to
balance their own respective budgets. We would be wise to
treat the “hands that feed us" with a generous measure of
upprccition. By our refusing to shoulder some of this in-
crease bitrdcii now. we risk the possibility that future re-
quests for assistance will fall on dcafcars. it would be at this
juncture that we would face the reality of becoming a low-
cost, low-qualin institution.
