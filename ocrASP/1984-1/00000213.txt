schools-irons“ tuition hikes with more aid funds

[COLLEGE PRESS SER VICE)
Administrators. say they're confi~
dent sludcnls will be able to absorb
another year of httge tttition at-
creases by resorting to tttore student
loans attd using more financial aid.
despite a recent study showing that
financial aid ls drying up for
students. . .

Lehigh. for example. is trying to
offset a ttine percent tuitiott ltikc for
next year by making ntore loans
available to stttdents. said Agnes
Gifford of the schools' treasttrcr's
office.

At Chicago State Unit crsity.
Budget and Planning director
Wayne Rath said students won‘t be
priced out of school “because ma-
jor scholarship amounts also in-
crease In a pcrcettt equal to in-
creases in tuition.»'That's been con-
sislanl over the years."

It may also be cltttttging.

Student court cases on the increase

Rocky Mount. N. C.
(COL LEGE PRESS SEIt’ l 'I(‘l:‘l
After a December. I980 ttigltt
basketball gattte. a non-student
named Kermit Smith jumped three
North Carolina \Velesyttn College
cheerleaders as tltey were leaving
the gym parking lot.

Smith forced titettt into ltis car at
knife point. and drote tltent to a
nearby quarry.

Tltcre. he raped attd tltert
rttttrdcred 20-year-old Witclettc
Venita Collins. When lte turtted to
free and attack tltc other two
women, however. he was over-
powered by them. Tltey lIed to safe-
ty.
Smith was later caught and con-
victed. He's now in‘ prison. on
death row.

North Carolina Wesleyan.
however. is still on trial. ‘

The two survivors of the
nightmare sued for a second tintc
last December. almost tltrcc years
to the day after tlte tragedy. claim-
ing the eolicge negligently con-
tributed to the crime by not pro-
viding adequate security or lighting
in the gym parking lot.

Students. in fact. are taking their
colleges to court in increasing
numbers recently. observers sttid.
charging them with negligence in
mishaps ranging from minor cuts to
rape and murder.

It's all leading to higher educa-
tion costs. strict new rules for
students, defensive administrators
attd even a sense of lost collegiality.
they said.

But the cases continue anyway. A
court recently made Ohio Universi-
ty pay dantagcs to a student who.
while trying to open a jammed
dorm window, shattered the glass
and cut himself.

In mid-January. a student
paralyzed in a University of Denver
fraternity house trampoline acci-
dent took his university to court.
claiming the University of Denver
was responsible for theaccident. I

A court last fall held‘Notre Dame
liable for injuries suffered bra stu-
dent wlto got drunk at the football
stadium and fell over a railing.

The “creeping legalisrn.",as
some administrators call it, has af-
fcted all kinds of schools. .

Seventy-two percent of the
schools belonging to the Christian
College Coalition. for example.
have been sued by their students
recently. ,

One would have thought that
the Christian mission of these col-
leges and the Christian com-
mitments of their constituencies
would have mitigated the litigious

“Nobody really expects that
federal programs will grow by very
much the next few years." said
Dennis Martin of the National
Association of Stttdent Financial
Aid administrators in Washington.
D.C.

A January. i984 College Board
study. moreover. concluded federal
aid to stttdcnts has declined by 2l
percent since i98l. making campus
costs markedly more difficult to
finance.

The study blamed .the phasing out
of Social Securtiy benefits for
students and tougher restrictions on
Guaranteed Student Loans (GSLs)
for letting tttition increases outpace
increases in student income and aid
each year since I980. As a result.
students have been going deeper in-
to debt to pay their way. Martin
said.

While sortie scltools like Leltiglt

approach to resolving differences,
cutttplttittts ttttd wrongs." reflected
Dr. W. Richard Stephens of Green-
ville College. Stephens oversaw a
study of suits against coalition col-
leges.

"Ohio State." reported OSU
presidential assistant Larry Thomp-
son. "has had three suits in the lasl
tttonth."

“Universities.” said Sheldon
Steittbach. lawyer for the American
Council on Education. “are in-
creasingly being held liable for the
well-being of their students." The
suits. he speculated. are “a part of
modern society. We’re an increas-
ingly litigious society."

“Society is changing." added
Amos Link. attorney for the
ntttrdered North Carolina Wesleyan
cheerleader's family. “These
atrocities may have always been oc-
curing, bttt people may not have
been as conscious of their rights.
attd have not been doing anything
about it.“ 'Moreover. “the cant-
puses are becoming as bad as the
streets."

“We have more attorneys than
any other country iii the world. and
they ltave to find something to do."
cxplained University of Denver

ltave big "institutional" loan funds
to help stttdents finance their educa-
tions. Murtlti said “community col-
leges ttttd some of the smaller public
colleges attd independent colleges"
have trouble making up the increas-
ed costs to students.

Even if they can. Martin added,
students can't keep going into debt
indefinitely.

"It's conceivable." he said.
“that schools that can‘t balance the
need for their own fiscal health with
students' ability to pay will find
themselves with an unacceptably
high defattlt rate in the future."

And new federal laws keep some
students from borrowing more
money even if they want to.

Notltern Arizona student Ablert
Arvallo. for one. works summers
bttt must keep his school work jobs

to a minimum. “If you work they.

Dean of Students Bob Burrell.
“Unless laws are changed to ttot
lct lawyers ltatttllc the cases on a
contingency basis. there will be not
relief," contended Charles Grier.
Brigham Young's insurance
overseer. “Lawyers file $4 million

suits, expecting to receive ltall' of
it."

Bttt Dr. Ed Hammond. a Univer-
sity of Louisville administrator
often called as an expert witness in
campus negligence cases. said he
thinks “there is no final solution
for all of it."

Colleges don't always lose the
cases. of course.

Hammond said a 1979 Delaware
Valley College case established that
schools mttst make students aware
of potential physical hazards and
tnust apply “minimum standards of
care" in maintaining their eam~
pttses.

But colleges are otherwise not
reponsible for the actions of third
parties, he said.

And a 1979 study of how public
institutions’ -— including some col—
leges — negligence trials ended
found the institutions on 54 per-
cent. said Jeannine Squaric of Jury
Verdict Research in Solon. Ohio. .

“My parents' income. although
not big. was at a level I couldn't
quality for aid" echoed DePaul
junior Jeni Iagow.

“They've taken us to the limit”

.~added Delaware senior Scott Web-

ber.

Some students say they're over
the limit. “My sister won't go to
school now.” said Vivian Burge of

_ Los Angeles City College. "Site was
on her way to college. but now she's
looking for a training program”
because LACC has become too ex-
pensive for her. Burge said.

“Tuition.” explained Michael
Alexander of Chaffey College in
Alta Lorna. Cai.. “puts an addi-
tional burden on poor people. We
will see a change in our student
population because titerc will be
fewer colored. Hispanic and fewer
minorities overall."

Washington State junior Judith
Dillard said she knows of "people
who aren’t coming back here"
because of rising tttition.

Enrollment figures. however,
suggest higher lttitions haven‘t
driven many people ottt of college
in the past.

Despite 45-to-73 percent hikes in
lite last three years in I4 southern
states. “southern enrollments have
been increasing steadily." reported
Joseph Marks of the Sottlltcrn
Regional Education Board.

Last year’s nationwide I0 perccrtt
hike at pttblic colleges didn't pre.
vent a one percent enrollment in-

crease. The immediate impact of

high tuition ittereases scents to be
on quality of student life ratlter
than on enrollment. .
Northern Arizona’ proposed $50
a term hike “makes a difference on

laundry costs," Arvallo said. “It’s
something people don’t even think
about. ldont' go out as much as l'd
like to. I can't afford it. I don‘t go
for pizzas."

Washington State‘s Dillard, who
works summers and has a GSL,

.says the next tuition hike will cost

her “a lot of miscellaneous stuff
like shampoo."

“My parents pay my tuition. and
this kind of puts a strain on them."
said Charmin Jackson, a Chicage
State senior. “They had to do
without things like fixing up the
ltouse."

Yet resentment levels seem to
ltave risen above even discomfort
levels.

“You get to the point where you
feel it's not worth it." said Univer-
sity of Miami junior Nancy Larsen.

“I'm sure some of (the increase)
goes for increased expenses." con-
curred Delaware student Craig
Aekerman. “bttt a lot of it is wasted
on food that’s poor attd stuff like
that."

"There is a new bookstore."
conceded classtttatcd Webbcr. “but
I was perfectly happy with the old
one."

Washington Slate's Dillard says
site ltas no idea “wltere tltc money's
going."

Many students of cottrse. take a
broatlcr view. “Utilities are goittg
ttp." noted Violet Mosbruckcr of
North Bismarck. “I ttnderstattd
why they're doing it (raising
tuition)."

A l0 percent hike “is realistic
because we're losing all kinds of
things on eatttpus. like periodicals
in the library." said Mark Driscoll.

ltit'ugu, IL
at I I t.t t-ttt ss st in it I iPluylmy says it‘s
ending for Big ll) schools this spring for its
ttttuttl Plavmate ttttd publicity hunt.

As is usual. some campuses have already
cgun to react to the projected visits of a
Iayboy photographer. scheduled to begin in

pril, according to magazine publicist David
layers‘ best estimate.

“There were rumbling on campus the day
ftcr" word of Playboy’s impending visit
cached Bloomington. Ind.. said Wendy
Veyen. editor of the Indiana Daily Student.

Playboy ‘5 been inspiring such campus
rumblings each spring since I977. when it
began concentrating on specific college con-
ferences. recruiting women to pose for possi-
ble appearances in tltc magazine's September
haek—to-campus edition.

The results often have been incendiary as

eollegians and administrators ltave protested

Playboy ‘3 presence.

In I979. for exantplc, Play/Joy's Ivy
League tour provoked many demonstrations
and inspired several campus papers to refuse
to run ads asking for women to pose.

“The Harvard Crimson took our ad and
the money we' paid. and failed to run the
ad." Salyers recalled. The editors “took this
paternalistic approach of ‘not with our
women you don't.”'

The most seriuos conflict erupted in 1980
at Baylor.

Abner McCall. then Baylor’s president,

threatened to expell any women who posed
naked for the magazine and identiﬁed
themselves as Baylor students.

A Baylor Lariat editorial criticising Mc-
Call's stance subsequentlycost three student
journalists their scholarships. College Press
Service later reported t' ‘ 'he one Baylor
woman who ﬁnally put. Playboy was
allowed to graduate “qui ttv "

Playboy toured the Southeastern Con-
ferettce in I98]. and the Big Eight in 1982.
largely without provoking anything tnorc
titan mild curiosity.

Itt I982. Playboy pltotograplter David
Chan attribute tlte calm to tire
"conservative" nature of the school's
students.

Last year's tour of Atlatttic Coast Cott-
I‘erence schools did elicit some protests.
Maryland students succeeded itt forcing ac-
tttal shooting sessions to an ofllcatttpus loca-
tiott.

Play/my itself doesn‘t dislike such con-
troversy. While “we don’t strive to throw
fuel on tltc fire.“ Salyers said the publicity
helps. “you batt the book itt Boston. and
guess witat everybody reads?"

Asked what site expected will happen wltett
Plavlmy arrives itt (’hampaign. Dally II/t'rti
Managing Editor Barbara Taylor said. “The

(groups) will protest. Witlt lite ltiglt ittcidcncc

it‘sreallybadtithing." ! i

Illegal computers investigated

(COLLEGE PRESS SER VICE) Rumors that
a substantial campus black tttarket in com-
pttters has arisen in recent weeks appear to be
false. bttt campus Officials worry that one
may appear soon along with a difficult sales
war with off-campus contptttcr dealers.

A USA Today newspaper story itt late
February alleged a large computer black
tttarket was forming on campuses as students
buy the machines at diseouttt front their
schools. attd then re-scll them to otlters at a
profit. But a College Press Service cltcck with
a number of contpttses now selling computers
at a discottttt indicates that, while officials
worry that a black market may appear. none
seems to be functioning yet.

Apple. for one. had shipped only about 48
of its new Macintosh computers by the end of
last week. making a black market in the
machines very small. if it exists at all. says
company spokesman Daniel Lewin. “It‘s not
like scalping football tickets." added
Gregory Marks. who oversees computing
programs at the University of Michigan.
“For a student to buy to computers (to re-
sell) is beyond most students' means.”

Nevertheless, all concerned say they’re
watching campuses closely for telltale signs
of emerging illegal contputer traffic.
newspaper ads offering to btty "used" com~
puters. students individually or collectively
buying more than one machine at a time. etc.
"We're going to monitor the campuses real
closely." ‘Lewin cautioned. “I would not
want to have any of our plans published."

Besides the 24 schools that recently arrang»
ed to sell Apple Macintoshcs at a $1200 dis-

cottttt to their students. scores of other cant-
puses recently ltavc started to sell cotttpttters
cheaply to their communities. Fourteen
universities ltavc signed tip to btty artd sell
new DEC 350 computers at 65 perccttt dis-
couttts.

This fall. Drew University will give all in-
coming freslttttctt Epson QX-IO tnicros for
about Sl700 each. Nortttal retail price for the
machines is over $4000. Zenith. IBM. and

And many others are letting students
choose their own brands in campus
bookstores. All the brands normally are sold
at discount prices. Not surprisingly. then. ads
ltavc already appeared til Drcxel and at Notre
Dame. asking students if they want to sell
their new computers.

Notre Dante officials. among others. itave
developed a few stop»gap measures to abort
the market.

Students who buy frotn Notre Dame's
store tnttst sign a “first refusal clause" that ‘
‘statcs the person cartnot sell the comptttcr
for a period of one year." bookstore
manager Ric Haleyu said. The university will
sue if it finds out tltc student violates the
agreement. he warned.

The University of Michigan is branding till
the machines it sells with a “U of M" symbol
and serial number to discourage black
ntarketeers. Mieltigan also makes students
promise not to re-sell tltc machines for two
years. or to pay a $2.000 “liquidation fee" to
the school if they do. l'l
