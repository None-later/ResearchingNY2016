Several Student Association (SA)
Supreme Court Justices have called

'for the removal of Justice Patty
. Salkin. charging that she was biased

when she sat on a recent hearing
regarding an SA Presidential can-
didate's campaign poster.

A hearing has been scheduled for
Tuesday night by Central Council’s
internal affairs cotnmittee. accor-
ding to Justice Mike Levine who

‘ wrote the statement calling for her

retnoval.

The criticism of Salkin stems
from her ittvolvement in a hearing
in which the Supreme Court over-
turned SA elections commissioner
Tom Busby's decision to ban SA
Presidential ltopcful Bill McCann’s
campaign poster.

Salkin ltad said before the hear-
ing that site had originally brought
the poster to the attention of so-
meone who cottid have .“an
interest" in Scltai'i‘er‘s campaign.

Salkln maintained that she had
not been biased in the McCann vs.
Busby case. She said she had
brought the poster to the attention
of the person "innocently." and
that she had not been “an in-
stigator" in the case.

"If at any time i felt I could not
fulfill" the duties of justice.
asserted Salkin. "i would not have
sat on the case._" Salkin also said
titat she objected to the fact that the
justices did not consult her before
they issued their statement.

Salkin expressed concern that
“the petty politics (in SA) have
spread and involved tlte court."

The statement "must not be con-
strtted as a political issue," Levine
stressed.

The Justices' statement charged
that Strikin has been involved in
Suzy Autetta‘s campaign for vice-
presidcnt. It said that Auletta has
admitted to being Scltat‘t'cr's
running-mate, and that by the
ttatttrc of the word

"running-mate." Auletta's cam-
paign members are concerned with
Schaffer's campaign. ‘

Salkin maintained that she had
‘never assisted with Schai‘fe'r's cam-
paign. and that Sehaf fer and Aulet-
ta had never said they were
“running-mates." She acknowledg-
ed that she has worked on Auletta's
campaign.

Sehaffcr said that Salkin was “in
no way involved" with his cam-
paign.

in addition to Levine. four other
justices. including Chief Justice
Steve Perrin, signed the statement.
Perrin later said that he has
withdrawn his signature from the
statement.

“I'm not sure." said Levine.
“but i wouldn’t be a bit surprised if
Steve Perrin was pressured from
within the upper esitelons ofSA" to
take his name off the statement.

Levine said that Perrin had had
“ample time to read" the state-

Speaking about her experiences as a
ttovclist. journalist. and short story writer
since the 1920's. Dorothy West was able to
give a SUNYA and community audience a
first hand look at the famed Harlem
Renaissance of tlte 1920's.

The Harlettt Renaissance was a tinte when
black authors and black culture became an
accepted part ot'Anteriean life. and West was
the junior member of a group of writers who
were most associated with the Renaissance.

West. a graduate of Boston University and
the Columbia School of Journalism, began
the lecture by reading a story she had written
about her ancestors and herself. Her grand-
parents were born slaves and so were lter
parents. "When slavery ended my father was
seven years old and he learned to buy and sell
in tile opett market. Later he opened two
retail stores. an ice cream parlor and a frttit
store." said West. Her lather was the first of
the new black middle class. "He was wealthy,
dressed beautifully, owned a car and a retired
raceltorsc nantcd Ned." said West.

"My tttotiter grew up a poor little black girl
in the sotttlt with it? brothers and sisters,”
said West. However. her mother was ttot
black in color because of her two wltite
grandfathers. She was a spirited cltiid who
grew up as a tomboy. being her .older
hrotltcrs' mascot. West said.

“Manta was a beautiful child. People pass—
ittg by would comment on her good looks
attd Mama would let ottt a string of curses.

Site was only -a little girl attd didn't even
know what tltey meant. bttt site could tell by
her brothers snickcring attd people's startled
expressions that it was something site
shouldn't ltave said." recalled West.

Witctt West‘s tttollter was l4 site moved
north to Boston to go to school. "When my
tttollter first ntet my father itt Boston she
hated him.” said West, because site was en-
vious of him. “Later, when my parents were
married. my mother complained that my
father's banker got all his extra money. Why
should the banker get my father's money to
grow rich on. my tnama wanted to know."
West said.

Born in Boston in l9l0. West said site was
an avid reader and had an interest in writing
from the time she was very young. “i
remember submitting a story to
Cosmopolitan when l was about 14 years old.
The editor sent back a scathing reply that l
was a bitter old spinster and knew nothing
about life. At the tittte l was crushed. bttt I
should have realized it was a contplimcnt that
he didn’t realize l was only a little girl."
recalled West. As a girl she ctttcred local
writing contests and usually placed at least se-
cond. if ttot first. site said.

Wlten site was l7 West recalled traveling to
New York. where site became the youngest
member of the writers associated with the
Harlem Renaissance. Site cattte to know the
major black writers of tltc day, including
Langston Hughes. Claude McKay. Wallace
Thurman and Zora Neale l-lut'ston. At the
time West was attending school durittg the

day attd workittg at night its an extra itt the
play “Porgy.”

West described tltc tittte as a period of
dccadettcc in New York. Site said site did not
like being a boltcntiatt and decided to travel
to Moscow with a group of black' writers and
artists to act ill a tttovic about tlte oppression

ing. 'Wc already printed a story by a black
writer this year.” Around that tinte West
fouttded Challenge. a black literary Journal.
Both Richard Wright and Ralplt Ellison

Schenectady’s Wildwood School
for the Learning Disabled will
receive close to $16,000 itt funds
raised for the school by SUNYA'S
Tclctltott '84. iteld last weekend.
This sum is a far cry from
Wildwood's first fund-raiser which
brougltt them $2.000 from the sale
of Tootsie Pops.

The amount received by the
school is approximately forty per-
cent oi' Telethon's gross. which
came to almost $39,000 this year.
according to Telethon Co-chair
Amy Zimmerman. The rest of this
year's funds will go to tltc Capital
District Speech Center. Zimmer-
man said. Wildwood has been a
recipient of Telethon funds for a
nutnber of years.

Wildwood school was founded in
was by "it group of parents who
were unsatisfied with existing in-
stitutions," said Wildwood Recrea-

.tionai Director Dennis Lake. The

focus in the sixties was in dealing
with mental retardation. with less
emphasis on the needs of the learn-
ittg disabled. Lake said. The parents
of Wiidtvood's first students felt
that their children ttcedcd a dif-
ferent form ofedueation. he added.

Wildwood, was started in 1966
with ntoney raised in their Tootsie
Pop sale which grossed approx-

imately $2.000. according to Lake.
The parents were permitted to use
the basement of a church to set up
operations. and with the money
raised Wildwood was founded.
“The principal's office was in the
bathroom" one Wildwood
employee recalled, “so that
witencvcr someone itad to go to the
bathroom, site had to leave her of-
flee."

Today. Wildwood is a modern
facility housing about 85.sludents
and serving nine counties.
Wildwood's Elementary Building
has a current enrollment of 65 lear-
ing disabled children. it is these

members of the Wildwood facility
who will receive the roost aid from
Telethon's program. said Lake.

Wildwood's Adolescent Pro-
gram, which operates at Shaker
High School in Latltant. provides
13 to 17 year old students with a
chance to learn pro-vocational skills
in an area which helps titetn develop
more positive social skills as well.
Although not in the same location.
the school is part of Wildwood.
Lake stressed. because Wildwood
rents the space in the high school.
There are currently 18 students
enrolled in Wildwood's adolescent
student program. '

The seltool also ltns a vocational
training program operated in con-
junction with the Latham Circle
Mail. This experimental project
allows the student to learn the
necessary concepts and skills to sur-
vive as an adult. away from
Wildwood's environment.

"Telethon‘s assistance is primari-
iy for children." Lake said. Two

services Telethon helps fund. Lake
said. are horseback ridittg attd
drivers ed —- “for us to do that
(provide such extensive programs)
would be impossible witltout
Telethon." he said.

Money raised by the Albany
students allows Wildwood to fund
many recreation activities. which is
an aid in social and emotional
growth. Lake said. Without
Telethon. “They were getting the
skills to perform a job, bttt were
unable to deal with the people
around them." he added.

“Telethon is more than \a
check." Lake stressed. “They come
and do a lot more.” Lake
specifically mentioned the "SUNY
Pal" program. praising the caring
and involvement of both the
Telethon workers and the SUNYA
students who helped create the pro-
gram.

“Money is almost secondary."
Lake said. "I don't know if you
want to print that. but i wanted t
suyit." '
