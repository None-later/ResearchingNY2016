By Maria Carllno

A computerized circulation
system that will enable students and
faculty to check otrt books more
easily will be installed next fall. at
both of SUNYA's libraries, accor-
ding to Director of Library Systents
Development Roger Gifford.

The system, designed by the
Canadian manufacturer GEAC
Computers lnc.. will be installed in
both the Main Library and the
Graduate Library for Public Affairs
and Policy on the downtown cam-
pus.

GEAC has installed library
systems for libraries across Canada.
the United Kingdom. and the U.S.,
including the libraries at Princeton,
Yale. and New York Universities.

Approximately $430,000. derived
from various sources including the
libraries' anticipated savings. will
be used to install the system. said
Paul A. Saintond. Assistant Vice
President for Research and Educa-
tional Development.

Currently. Gifford said, seven
Public Access Terminals are
available in the library where
students can call up any book in the
library by authorl title, and call
number and determine whether or
not the book is available. The new
system will include a method of
search similar to the Moneymatic
machines in the Campus Center.

Public Access Terminals will pro—
vide a clear step-by-stcp inquiry of
questions and responses that will
speedily provide information to the
user regarding book titles. authors.
call numbers. book availability and
other related information, he said.

The new system “should make
check out faster and more
accurate” for both the patrons and
the library personnel. said Gifford.
Each book will receive a l4 digit
“CODABAR” similar to the bar
codes on grocery items. The sweep

of a hand held wand (laser scanner)
over the bar code will result in im-
mediate signaling for the computer
to indicate the book's status and
rtpdatc the inventory. Gifford'ex-
plaincd. .
Complete up-to-datc reports. on
the status of books and patron fines
for overdue and damaged books,
will replace the current system, he
said. This system must now rely on
weekly printouts for such informa-
tion. This will enable the circulation
staff to provide information more
rapidly. reducing patron waiting
time and allowing the staff more
time to devote to such duties as in-
ventory collection. Gifford said.
Once the new system is installed.
each patron will be required to fill
out an ID. and address form and

will later receive a bar coded card ‘

for checking books in and out, he
added. Usage of the card can be
stopped if it is lost or stolen. and
password protection and other in-
ner security features make the
systctn very difficult to penetrate.
he said.

The bar code system and the
Library's Security System will re-
main independent of one another.
and an alarm system will be install-
ed that will be sounded when a
book is improperly checked out or
when there is no bar code in a book,
Gifford said.

Concerns such as cost effec-
tiveness and viability were discussed
before the decision to purchase a
GEAC system was made, Gifford
said. "We looked to see what other
systems were available and we look-
ed at the feasibility of adopting this
system," explained Gifford. “We
asked for proposals from com-
panies we knew that provided such
systems and picked one that best
met our needs for the least amount
of money."

Before February. none of the

Library plans new book system

over one million volumes within the
libraries contained bar codes. Gil.
ford said, but the library is now
undertaking a massive bar coding
project. Books that still remain un-
coded by next semester will have to
be individually coded as they are
checked out by each patron. he
said.

In an effort to reduce and prevent
delays and inconveniences. the
“80-20 Rule," Gifford said. is be-
ing applied in which theoretically
“20 percent of the collection ac-
counts for 80 percent of the circula-
tion of books." Although Gifford
said these figures may vary slightly.
the process involves bar coding the
most widely circulated 20 percent so
that there will be an 80 percent
chance that the book being checked
out will be bar coded. “We hope to
have 100.000 books bar coded by
September," said Gifford. and the
library hopes to automate the entire‘
book reserve system in the future as
well, he added.

Extensive measures to anticipate
and prepare for possible uncon-
trollable problems such as power
failures are being made also, in-
cluding the nightly copying of data
files on magnetic tapes which will
serve as back-up data should the

‘originals be destroyed or mutilated.

he said.

Gifford nraintained that the new
system will not result in a staff
reduction. Instead, Gifford said he
expects user expectations will rise
and sttrdents and faculty will de-
mand more, better, and faster ser-
vices from the library.

Long-range plans for the system
include allowing microcomputer ac-
cess to the circulation system. Gif-
ford said. howevcr, that arty expan-
sion in that direction would not be
possible until a new campus
telephone system is installed in early
I985.

Speaker's Forum charged with mismanagement

<Front Page

or three people cannot run the
group." said Amy Alterson who
had opposed Sclrwnrtl, and Mitni
Diamond for treasurer in the elec-
lions held Monday.

(iolubow, who oversaw the elec-
tions. annorrnccd that the outcome
cottld not be determined because
the group's constitution was not
clear on whetltcr or not the
chairperson could vote.

He said that they will ask
Supreme Court to r,ulc on it.
Trutaros might then be given the
opportunity to vote twicc because
the chairperson breaks tics. In the
group‘s consitutiort. it says that the
chairperson “shall vote only in the
case of a tie vote."

To obtain voting rights a member
must attend tltrcc consecutive
meetings said Altcrson. She and
Steiner said that until recently there
were only IO members in the group.

The membership jumped to It?
recently and Alterson and Stciner
charged that this was a ploy by the
regime of Trataros, Schwartz and
Feldman to stack the vote.

Goldberg ran against Trataros
for the position of vice chairperson
in Monday's elections.

“The Lyman show was the straw

, that broke the camel's back." said

(iolubow. liarsky said the $4.500
cost of thc Lyman show was out of
line bccause it was only the second
speaking engagement for Lyman.
who is a former star of the popular
soap opera All My Children.
Speaker's Forum did not charge
admission to it because ticket sales
were going poorly and it was an cf-
fort to save face. said Fcldman.
ITeldrnan maintained they ltad of-
I'crcd t'rcc adrniwion before. Barsky
said they wcr pposcd to have
charged 53-5 for tickets and should

have at least charged for Iron-
taxeard holders.

lirtrsky showed bills for a buffet
held after the lircnrrcr show totall-
ing $265. but ltc stlid that the come-
diurt did rtot attend the buffet.

He also said that a bill totalling
$26 was submitted for liquor costs
in conjunction with the Shore llitc
speech, which was cancelled after
llitc was in an auto accident while
on her way to the airport in New
York Cil)’.

(iolubow said, “These people
(Schwartz and Feldnran) think
they're autonomous to SA policies.

It is an example of people taking
advantage of the system."

Speaker's Forum also attempted
to get SA Audio Visual workers to
hang posters, said (iolubow.
“That's ridiculous. what do they
(Speaker's Forum) have group
members for?" lie asked.

Speaker's Forum lttts an SA irr-
cornc line of $22,000 which they
nearly met with the $21,000 profit
at tile llr'cnner'shon. This seemed to
he the beginning of the end because
it took away their desire to rnitkc
money, added (iolubow. ‘

Hart pledges support to education

eluded several students. He drew
enthusiastic applause when be pro-
posed that as president. he would
"restore the fpnds to Guaranteed
Student Loans that Reagan has
cut."

“When I debate Reagan next
fall." said Hart, “and he asks me
where I'll get the money for educa-
tion. I’ll tell him — from the MX
and the B-I bomber funds."

Hart claimed that besides cutting

funds for the MX and the B-I‘

bomber, he also plans to put a “six
month freeze on the testing of

nuclear weapons."

The crowd of wcll-wisltcrs waited
Monday for 45 minutes before Hart
arrived. Many were on their lunch
break and were enjoying the sounds
of a local country band while
waiting for the 47 year old can-
didatc to appear.

Hart arrived in Albany with his
wife Lee, in a last minute campaign-
ing effort. At stake in Tuesday's
New York primary are 252
delegates; 33 delegates will be
chosen later.

Hart recently won Connecticut's
primary. claiming 55 delegates. "'

Salkin ’s removal requested

ment. and mat "he (Pcrrin) signed
it as it was."

Pcrrin said he originally signed
the statement because “I had
reason to believe there was a need"
to investigate “unanswered ques-
lions."

"The questions don't exist," said
Pcrrin. He explained that he “did

some checking" on his own into the
case. Perrin refused to specify who
Ire had spoken to.

Salkin asserted that council's In-
Vcrnal Affairs committee chair Neil
Shapiro was biased against her, and
that “the case should be thrown out
of Central Council.”

Shapiro could not be reached for
comment. I 'I
