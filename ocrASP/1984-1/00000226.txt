Findings of a recent study show
at repeated exposure of pregnant
men to excessive airport noise
n harm fetal development and
try be responsible for early births
infants having signiﬁcantly low
ight.
Lawrence Schell. an assistant
ofcssor in the SUNYA's An-
ropology Department found that
- egnant women exposed to sound
vcls of airplane noise of 100 or
are decibels were delivering their

.tbics to days earlier than women

ho were not exposed to the noise.

Data included in Schell's study

as collected from a resident com-

uriity of the Middle Atlantic
tales that is regularly exposed to
to noise emitted from airplane

4. kc-ol‘fs and landings at their inter-

ational airport. Schell said the
ame must remain anonymous.

The study. funded by the US.
ublic Health Service and the
UNY Research Foundation, in-

olved community members with
lmilar social and ethnic makeups

rid lifestyles divided into residents

hose homes were exposed to low.

cdium, and high levels of noise;
he highest noise level being too to
l05 decibels. A control group was
also established of people who did
not live in flight paths.

Professor Schell found that the
noise affected only those mothers in
the highest level group. “Effects
will depend on how frequent and
how loud the planes are. and how
close the people live to the noise

scurcc." said Schell. “For those
who were really close. the effect was
signiﬁcantly greater. But once you
moved away from the
neighborhood closest to the noise,
there really isn't any difference I
could find."

In addition to infants weighing
less at birth. other medical pro-
blems including headaches. hearing
loss. high blood pressure. and
gastrointestinal disease could result
in mothers and infants from this
type of overexposure. .

“An adverse environmental
feature. such as noise and toxins.
affects growth and development
because growth and development is
a summary measure of health being
dependent on a large variety of
physiological processes and
pathways". he said.

Schell feels that his research in
the Netherlands. Japan. and the
two neighboring communities in the
Middle Atlantic States is relevant
and applicable in other airport com-
munities. such as the nearby Col-
onic community. which have

  

. UN‘YA'prof: noise can harm fetus

similar frequency and dccibcl levels.

‘His studies are important in that

they involve thé chronic affects
resulting from noise exposure.
"More people are exposed
chronically than acutely." said
Schell.

Noise pollution. and its
biological effects on organisms ls
just one aspect of the study of
human biology. Schell pointed out.
Although it has not been widely
known on this campus. in addition
to fossils and artifacts. human
biology has been a large part of the
study of anthropology. It involves
anthropologists as well as those in-
volved in the medical field. he said.

This summer Schell plans to
begin a study in the Glens Falls area
regarding the cffccls of exposure to
toxins. such as polychlorinatcd
biplicnyls (PCBs). on fetal and
child development. The topic of
growth is very general and such cn-
vironmcntal features as noisc and
toxins are good screening dcvlccs in
regard to studying growth. Sclicll
