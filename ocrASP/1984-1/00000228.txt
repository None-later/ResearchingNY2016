State University nutrition professor
wlto has pablically criticized the
safety of the new artil‘ical swcctcncr
“Nutt'achet” is fighting off an at-
tack on his own credibility after it
has discovered he purchased stock
in thc drug-company that manul‘ac-
tutcs the swcctcncr. _

ASU I’rol'cssor Woodrow Monti,-
lttts admitch he purchascd “put”
options in Scarlc I’lltlt'macctllicals
itt attticipatiott of thc stock pricc go-
ing down,prior to the airing of
scrcral CBS Iclcvision reports on
the safety harards of the new food
additive the drug company
manufactures.

Monte, who has done research in-
dicating the swcctcncr may dccom-
pose into harmful chemicals undcr
cct‘taitt circumstances, was one of
the main critics of the acts drug--
gcttctically known as spartamc--on
thc (“HS programs.

“l’ut” optiotts arc ordcrs to pttl a
block of stock up for sale at a cct—
Iain lil'IL'L' within a sct period of
titttc,

Monte told the ASU studcnt
ucnspapcr, the State Press, that hc
bought options on Scarlc stock
sctcral wccks before the ptoittattt
was broadcast in January. twist. att-
licipatittg the stock \\ottltl Iosc \ttilIL'
ut'tct tltc broadcast.

As it turns out. IltmuiL't’. thc
Static stock ttctcr plummctcd tltc
uav Monte had spccttlatcd \‘.Ilt.‘ll ItL‘
Imught thc options. that the stock
price dropped drastically. Montc
oottid have made a handsottic
rcttun on his $l994 invcstmcnt.

Instead. according to reports in
the Wall Strcct Journal. Monte lost

$l224 in the stock options \‘cntttrc.

Now the Securities attd Iixchatlgc
Commission-- the t'cdcral agcncy
tltat rcgttlatcs stock trading-- is in-
vestigating Monti: and scvcral ("HS
cmployccs for possibly trying to
profit from L'htlngcs in Scarlc stock
prices brought on by the broadcast
of their own information.

The controversy, ol'coursc. raises
qucstions ttbottt the objectivity of
Monlc‘s acadctnic rcscarch as well
as abottt what would be illegal stock

manipttlatiott.

ASU administratorsI howevcr.
said they aren't conducting any
similar invcstigation on their owtt.

“I think the research he was
discussing was probably Icgilituatc-
ly a part of his rcscarch here," said
ASU Vice President Maurccn I-‘t‘yc.
“I've tried to keep the issuc
scparatc from the, university,"
Montc lamented. “(The
Ntttrachct rcscarch) was my own
work I did during the summcr."

But “I knew Scarlc would get dir-

 

ty and il would become a hot
DDIiIICTII issue." he said.

Ilut such potential conflicts bet-
ween prot'cssors' academic research
and othcr otttsidc ttctivitcs are caus-
ing ittcrcasing problems and con»
ccrns at schools! a widc.sourccs
say. In the 1‘)th " howl year. for
instance, til port's. . of 4000 faculty
mcmbcrs survcycd by the Chronicle
of Higher Iiducation reported they
carncd an average $5700 a year
from outside consulting and
rcscarch activity.
