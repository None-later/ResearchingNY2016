Salkin recall falls

A bill to rctnove Justice Patty Salkin frotn
the Student Association Supreme Court was
defeated during Wednesday’s Central Coun-
cil meeting. There were 15 votes against
removal. 7 abstentions and no votes in favor
of the bill.

Council's Internal Affairs Committee
recommended that Council vote against the
bill. The justices were interviewed at a com-
mittee session held Tuesday.

The issue of Salkin's removal was raised by
five of the seven justices. According to Com-
mittee Chair Neil Shapiro. they brought a
document to the meeting which alleged “im-
proprieties" in actions taken by Salkin dur-
ing a recent court case.

She had brought a campaign poster to the,

sale of equipment. he continued.

“High technology is a people business."
asserted Salerno. “New York Telephone
deals with people . We ltave to “take Iltc extra
step' attd make sure we help our customers."
he said. referring to the rtcw NYT slogan
‘Take the extra step.‘

The divestiture ltas also placed a greater
responsibility on the shoulders of New York
Telephone executives. said Salerno. Former-
ly. NYT made up less than one-twelfth of the
A'l‘&T Bell System. but now the company
comprises over two-thirds'of its new parcttt
cotttpany. New Yorkew tingland IEschangc
(NYNEX). he said.

What this means. according to Salerno. is
"We must manage (the company) \vell...tltc
risk has been increased. we are no longer
ttttder the A'l‘&'l‘ umbrella."

Two major dilemmas which Salerno said
face the new company are the issues of access
cltarges and bypass.

Artificially high long distance rates ltad
subsidized the costly service itt rural attd
suburban areas when NYT worked under the
AT&T utnbrclla.

Now. Salerno explained. long distance ser-
vice is provided by "carriers" such as A'l‘b’e'l‘.

as small business and residential customers
will pay. '

l'his cottld mean drastic increases in cont-
munication costs for large businesses and
organi/ations which use the phone networks
for telemarketing. said Salerno.

To alleviate the new costs. he said.
businesses could attempt to “bypass” the
NYNIEX network by going through less ex-
pensitc networks offered by a competitor.
Large businesses are tempted to use these
bypasses cvtensively. he added. and this
could mean real trouble for the BOC's. due
to the large amount of revenue the bigger
companies currently generate.

Salerno contended that this might force
residential phone rates so high that many
low-income families would not be able to af-
ford Iclcpltonc service.

However. Salerno said. NYNEX could
begin to offer a less costly bypass of their
own network. “The technology needs to
thatch the competition." said Salerno. ad-
ding that NYNEX plans to offer the latest in
fiber optics attd digital switching.

“'flte goal." declared Salerno. “is to
create art end-to-end digital network. Over
two-thirds of all optic fiber installed is here
(N.Y.)." l i

 

attention of someone involved in tile carti-
paign of SA President Riclt Schaffcr. A case
on the legality of the poster was brought to
the court and Salkin voted on the case. She
said she had not been biased itt sitting on the
case.

Art work needed

The New York State Vietnam Mcntorial
Art Gallery is seeking works to be exhibited
in its inaugural show. according to the Office
ofGeneral Services. The show is scheduled to
open on Sunday. May 27. and will run
through Labor day week-end.

The tltcme of the exhibit is “Buddies.” ac-
cording to the news release. The works ex-
hibited “will capture the human dimension
of the war and its aftermath." said John C.

.Egan. Commissioner of General Services.

The works exhibited in “Buddies” will be
selected in a juried competition. Works will

the exhibit. their poignancy. and their artistic
merit. according to the release.

The deadline for slides. photographs or

Association. SA Controller Adam Barsky
said. He explained that the money would be
administered by a graduate student organiza-
tion. and that it has not yet been determined
how much of the money SA would receive.
“The amount we're bouncing around now is
50 percent," he said.

Barsky said he doesn't think the referen-
dum will appear on the ballot in next week's
election. There is a chance tltough. said Bar-
sky. that there will be a vote in late April. if
the graduate students are prepared to debate
the issue. “We must give the graduate
students time to educate their constituents."
Barsky maintained.

Graduate students as well as part-time
students would be voting on the referendum.

he explained. adding that undergraduates
would not he allowed to vote. The decision to
tax themselves would be strictly controlled by
only graduate and part-time students. Barsky
said.

SA President Rich Schaffer said he feels
that the additional fee is necessary. “I feel
that SA can no longer offer services to
graduate students under the current tax strue—'
lures. We used to be able to grant these ser-
vices but we can’t afford to do it anymore,"
Schaffcr explained. He said he believes the
fee would have additional benefits. such as
getting graduate students more actively in-
volvcd on campus. The additional funds
would give the students more representation

.in many organizations as well. he said.

Many graduate students ltave expressed
opposition to the fcc. saying they don‘t par-
ticipate in SA funded activities. They main-
tain that a fee will not necessarily get more
graduate students involved.

Barsky disagreed. saying. “The fee will
’make the graduate students less dependent on
us (SA) for activities. We'll be able to work
together on many academically related pro-
jects." Barsky said he believes that graduate
students do participate in SA funded ac-
tivities. "Recent surveys showed that
graduate students were heavily concentrated
in many student groups. including interna-
tional groups and AMIA." he said.

He maintained that graduate students are
involved. even if only attending campus

Awards banquet held

The School of Business will host an
Awards Banquet at tlte Americana Hotel on
Saturday. April 7 at 5:30 pm.

Fifteen different awards will be given to
chosen graduates and undergraduates in the
School of Business. The awards are being
sponsored by various fraternities and
organirations associated with the business
school. according to David Waroboff. Presi-
dent ot‘ Pi Sigma Epsilon.

in addition students will be inducted into

movies or being aided by Five Quad Am-
bttlanccs.

O'Leary said lte plans to meet with
graduate students to discuss the proposed
l'cc. “There are a number of decisions that
must be made. For example, we need to
decide whether the fee would include
graduate students and part-time students, or
any combination of the two." he explained.

Asserting that he is reviewing the issue
carefully. O'Leary would not speculate on
when a referendum could be held. but he said
it would probably not be held for a while. He
said that all graduate students must be
familiar with the subject before a vote is
taken. “We want to pursue the issue careful-
Iy and go on after that,” he stated. Cl
