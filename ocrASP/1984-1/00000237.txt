Whitlock.

He said that under the new state budget.
students who are members of families where
the income is between $25.000-29.000 are
now eligible for TAP.

In addition. the new law means there will
be a 20 percent increase for fully funded
students from families which lie in the lowest
eligibility range, he said.

National Direct Student Loans
Due to cutbacks in federal funding.
SUNYA can lend out no more money than it
did in the 1979-80 academic year through the

parent-student loan programs.

However. Whitlock said. fewer students
are bothering to file for GSL. “It was too
liberal prior to the Reagan administration,
now it is too stringent. (and) the middle class
has gotten killed," he explained.

Parent-student loans are available through
banks as well. but Whitlock said the loans
must be repaid beginning the month after the
loan is taken.

demonstrated on the FAF. Whitloelt said
both part-time and full-time undergraduate
students are eligible. but that "with the
Reagan administration criteria Pell Grant
doesn't help middle class or the really needy
