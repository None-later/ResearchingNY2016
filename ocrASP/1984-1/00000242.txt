RZA is not a (action, it is an extremely active student
group which supports the Jewish students 01‘ SUNYA. along
with lllL' Albanycommunity and the state of lsrucl.- RZA has
also trlcd to work together with JSC-Hlllcl and their primary
goal is to unite. not divide tlrc Jewish community. It is the
author's attitude which l'ostcrs division she speaks of.

PL‘lhltlinl attacks on Rich Sclial'l'cr arc nut necessary or

Not our policy

T0 the Editor:

In light of the Tucsday. April 3rd icttcr. ctilitlcd
"Dishonest Rclalions." l l‘cci compelled to express the
following:

The policy toward RZA as decided by thc cxccutivc com-
mittee. is that there is no reason why two Jewish organiza-
tions cannot exist and work harmonioust on a campus
which has such a large and diversified Jewish population.

JSC-Hillcl is not a political group and docs not endorse or
lobby against any cadidatc or organi/ation. Tircrcl‘urc
following this policy. Hillel has not lobbied tigttinst RZA‘s
budget. Sharon Wattlbcrg went to Student Association its an
individual without arty authority or powcr to rcprcscril JSC-
Hillel. As President. 1 am the spokcspcrson iriipuwcrcd by
the organization. 1 had no previous knowledge of tlic letter
and was just as surprised as everyone else to read it.

JSC-Hillcl has had a good working relationship with Rich
Scltall'cr and Other SA ol't'icizils. Tlicrcl'orc Sharon's allega-
tions are personal opinions and are not rcl'lcciivc 01' Hillel‘s
relationship with Rich.

We regret the tone and content 01‘ her letter and sittcc’dy
hope it will not interfere iti our interaction witli Rich Schul-
I'cr or RZA in tlic l'uture.

Proper decision

'l'o tltc I'Idilnr:

l'llc t'ccctrt Stitdcnt Association (SA) decision to l'utid tlic
Rcvisiotiist Zionist .-\|tctnrui\c (RZA) has raised much till-
nccdcd passion. The debate of iilictitcr or not to fund RZA
has bccti tttintcd by unscrupulous political and childish per-
sonal intcrcsts. Tlic ttt'gttttrctits iti rotor ol' the SA's decision
could not be stronger and tltc ttrgutttcnts against are both
casily rcl'uitiblc and petty.

'l'ltc RZA was l'otrndcd iri Septcttibcr 1982. Since then its
lliclllltt‘l'\lil[‘1 littx grown to ttirriost lot) and its iiicssugc is heard
by tltc cttlirc campus. RZA has provided an outlet l'or Jews
to take pride iti lxt’t 1. iii Iitcir Jewiin lict'itugc. and present
day conccrns. ()tic ticcd only look at the change in the level
01‘ Jewish trwttrcticss and of active participation in Jewish
cttuscs by SUNYA students over the past two years to
recognize RZA“. impact.

RZA is it completely SUNYA studcnl rttti and orientated
campus group. RZA has developed excellent working rela-
tions with tltc SA. tltc lilll\'L‘1’.\ll)"h administration. other stu-
dent groups and the ctunpm community at large. RZA has
been instrumental iii educating tlic campus community on
issues concerning lxracl. tltc plight ol‘ upprcsscd Jewish com-
munities. on duntcstic Amcri-an and SUNY anti-scmitism
and on a wide variety ol‘ other topics. The impression made
by RZA on this campus cannot be ovcriy ctrtphasr" d. From
all quarters ol‘ tlic Student Association and university ad-
ministration RZA ix praiscd as an exemplary group providing
information. education. and leadership for tltc campus com-
munity.

The arguments against l'unding center around three
'licmes. Tlizit RZA is political. RZA duplicates existing scr-
viccs atid that by funding RZA somehow anti-scmitism will
increase.

RZA is tint a political group. Just as tltc Grcck Society ex-
plains tltc Cypriot i\sttc RZA explains the Arttb-lsracii Con-
t'lict. Just as ASUBA calls (or black solidarity and black
rights. RZA call for Jewish solidarity and-Jewish rights. Just
as Amnesty international calls for an end to human rights
violations iii Ccntrtil Amcrica RZA calls (or an end to
persecution of chs world wide. RZA is not affiliated with
any political party either in the United States or iii lsrael. The
small amount of outside support that RZA rcccivcs comes
