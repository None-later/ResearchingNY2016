Stickmen take two from Capital

 

Defeats Union,.11-6, edges RPI in overtime

By Mark Wllgard

\l.tII'ItRI/I;‘N

It's beena verysnc‘ ' t'ul week thus far for
the Albany State lacrosse team. The Danes
opened up their I984 season on Tuesday with
a conte from behind lt-lt) win over RP! and
yesterday they defeated another local' rival.
the Dutchntcn of Union. by a score of ll-6.
Albany can claim the bragging rights of the
Capital District area with a win over Sierra to-
day on University Field at 3 pm.

Against Union College. a resilient Great
Dane defense continuously turned back- the
attack of the Dutchmen. Senior captains Joe
Campbell and Peter Wong were the main
stoppers in the defensive backfield for
Albany. "We had a strper gante
defensively," commented Albany Head
Coach Gary Campbell. “I'll take holding a
learn to six goals arty day of the week."

The Danes started slowly on offense. but
picked things up as the game progressed.
Union had a 3-] advantage It) minutes irtto
the second quarter. btrt goals by Dave Ccrny
attd John Norris 5| seconds apart enabled
Albany to tie the game up rtt 3-] right before
the trait.

Albany strtrck quickly and often it] the
third quarter to turn the game wide open.
Jim Mel’artlin ncttcd tlte first of his two
goals at the 2:53 mark. Cct'ny made it 5-3
when he tallied three minutes later. The
nicest goal of the day for Albany came mid-
way through the quarter. Dave llamilton led
a Great Dane rush up the field before dishing
it off to Ccrrry on his left side. Ccrny then fed
lloh Verier. who was all alone itt front of the
net. Verier tappcd it ltorttc for a 6-} Albany

lead. Rick Tri/aro closed ottt the quarter
when ltc scored on a pass from Cerny.
Mcl’ttrtlin. Verier and Don Casadonte ad-
ded fourth quarter goals to boost tltc Danes
to their second consecutive home win. ‘-‘Thc
bottom line is that we outltustled them."

noted Campbell. “We just wanted the gattte

I more."

The Dancs also sectned to be the ltungrier
team on Tuesday when they went up against
the Engineers of RPI in their season opener.
Trailing by l0-7 with five minutes to play.
Albany struck for three late goals to force an
overtime period. Vcricr then scorcd the gatne
winner I:2() into the overtime.

Campbell said. "It showed otrt there that
this was the first game of the season. We
didn't play ttcarly as well as we could have.
The kids had a lack of scritnmagcs. lack of
gatnc situations. and a lack of being on the
field."

Albany trailed 5-3 at the half before they
began to turn things around in the third
quarter. Verier atrd Casadonte tallicd mid—
way through thc stan/a to tie the game up at
5-5. Moments later. John Norris rushed the
ball the length of the field and fcd off to
Casadonte. wltojust missed puttirtg it by Rl’l
goalie Kevin l’isctttelli. 't‘hc l-ngincers then
capitali/cd on Albany's missed opportunity
attd scored two Iatc third quarter goals to
regain the lead at 7-5.

It looked as though Albttttt was through
tor the day as Rl’l opened up a “H lead with
a little twcr four minutes to play. ltut the
Danes wouldn‘t quit. After Norris and Rich

SPORTS BRIEFS

Men’s tennis

The men‘s tennis team's rnatclt against
Binghamton last Tuesday was cancelled
due to ittclettrctrt weather. The Danes will
travel to Bingltarnton today to play the
make-up game. Yesterday's match which
would have been at ltottte against Sicna
was rained out. No make-up date has been
scheduled yet.

On Saturday. the team will trike on the
University of Vermont. a strong Division I
school. Vermont will be looking to avenge
last fall's 6-3 defeat to Albany. Co-
captains Dave Ulrich and Rob Karen will
try to get on track as the two lost their
singles matches against Skidmore irt the

.team's only ntatelt this sprittg.

in last year's match. Ulrich defeated
Mike Duffy in three sets. Duffy was
runner-up in this year's Great Dane
Classic and was the ECAC champion. so
Ulrich's win was a bit of a surprise.

“I know that he‘s (Duffy) going to have
revenge on his mind," said Ulrich. “He's
probably going to be ready for me, so I’m
just going to give it my best shot."

The lack of matches this spring will not
help Ulrich in his quest to beat Duffy for a
second time. Since Duffy is from a Divi--
sion l school. he has been able to remain
sharp all year round. Ulrich's goal will be
to try to attack and remain confident.

Karen is still trying to ftrlly recover
front an injured finger. which has
hampered his play somewhat. “It's still
not better yet." said Karen. “I have been
working with the tenor for two weeks
now, but it takes titnc for the swelling to
go down.

The co-captaitt will probably play
fourth singles against Vermont. depen-

far ahead of last year's learn and the girls are
rnttning much better titties," stated a pleased
Coach White.

The Danes had ntrmcrotts strong perfor-
tnanccs, starting off with the outstanding

l-‘ridny. “It's probably better for the
team." said Karen. “I don‘t feel [00 per-
ccnt yct."

Women’s softball

Tire Albany State Women's softball
learn pulled a fast one on the schedule-
ntakers of the NCAA.

Realizing that the expected rains would
cancel their upcoming grime against Sierra
yesterday. the Danes decided to play the
game on Wednesday before the storms hit
the area.

Tltey are probttbly wishing they didn't
play at all. its they dropped it ll-7 decision
irt their season debut.

Senior Caryl Mayor. making her per-
sonal pitching debut. fared well. allowing
only two earned runs. The errors from ltcr
defense didn‘t exactly help the cttttse.

“Opening day jitters." said Coach Lee
Rhonish, explaining the team's sloppy

 

play ln the field.
