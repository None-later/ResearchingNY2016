Students returning from spring
break with cars so they can 'bring
their belongings home at the end of

the semester may find yellow tickets 7

under their windshield wipers for

no apparent reason. but a quick ‘

- step at the Public Safety building
may end the problem.

According to Director of Trafﬁc

Division Lloyd Hebert all vehicles

mttst be registered with Public Safe- ‘

ty. Decals are available 24 hours a
day, for a $5.00 fee. The sticker
must be affixed to the rear btunper
on the driver‘s'side.

All tncntbers of tile Universin
commttnity are pertttitted to park
their cars in University facilities if
they follow the guidelines outlined
by the Traffic Division. he said.
Registration with the University is
required of every vehicle being

, parked on campus. Ite added.

There are basically three types of
parking facilities on campus. accor-
ding to Hebert. These are regular
lots. pay lots, and special permit
areas. '
Atty registered vehicle cart park in
any of the large parking lots located
near the four quads. However, the
front of botlt the Dutch amt State
qttad lots have been designated for
facility and staff only.

Dtttch and Colonial quads also
have monthly pay lots which re-
qttire an appropriate decal and have
a fee of $48 per year. According to
Hebert. there is a long waiting list
for these lots and they are filled on
a first come-fist serve basis. There is
also an administrative pay lot
located near Colonial which costs
$50 per year.

'Visitors to the University are en-
couraged to park in the visitor's pay
lot which charges a maximum fee of
$3.!» per day.

clude the parking areas around the

quads. require a special pcrtnit
which must be applied for through
the traffic division.

Special permits are awarded on

the basis of tncdical need. occupa-
tional need or in special cases of a
permit being needed temporarily
for a particular function.
Repairmen. vendors. contractors.
and even pizza delivery people often
receive these permits.

All special permits issued on the
basis of medical need require a doc:
tor-'s note and -must go through the.
inﬁrmary for approval. according
to Hebert.

An occupational permit is given

if it is deemed necessary. Occupa- .
. special permit areas.

tional permits are applied for by
speciﬁc departments who ﬁnd that

u is necessary for a car to be accessi-
ble 2 or 3 times per day. The ap-
plications are reviewed by Director
of Catnpus Life. Jim Doellefcld and
then sent for final approval to Vice
President Frank Pogue.

Doellefcld makes an assessment
as to whether or not the permit is
needed to “fulfill responsibilities."
He said that most occupational per-
mits are issued early in the fall and
that he uses the measures of past is-
suance and unusual need as criteria.

v-When ' askwr'what constitutes
“unusual need," Doellefcld cited as
examples. the co-chair of Telethon
and the Senior Class President who
ivouid need‘ periodical use of the
