On a cold, blustery day at
Brockport this past Saturday. the
Albany State women's track and
field team picked up their first win
of the outdoor season in convincing
fashion. In less than favorable con-
ditions, the Danes outdistanced
their Brockport opponents by a
score of 92-53.

The weather, somewhere in the
high thirties and windy. tirade good
times. throws, and jumps hard to
come by, btrt as Coach White corn-
mentcd. “The important thing was
that we picked up the win. We've

had to run very tough competition
indoors and started out this season
running Division II Springfield. so
the win against Brockport should be
a good confidence builder."

The Danes set the tone for the
meet early as Bette Dzamba and
Chris Varley finished one-two in the
meet's first running event, the
5000-meter. Dzatnba, running
alone and lapping the entire field,
took the race with a fine time of
l9:l2. Varley meanwhile, came
from far back to catch Brockport’s
Angela Dillon late in the race to
take second place with a time of
2l:09.

The shotpttt saw Albany's first
sweep of the day. Mary thndICS
captured first place with a throw of
34’25". She was followed by Kim
Lozier in second with a throw ol'
3l’9". and Andrea Delaurier in
third with a throw of 3l’6".'

The Danes were greeted with a bit
of luck in the next event. as a

Women tracksters defeat Brockport for first Win '

Brockport was safely ahead going
into the last leg of the relay. but the
Brockport anchor leg left early and
received the baton out of the pass-
ing lone, thereby forfeiting the
event‘s five points to the Danes.

Lynn Jacobs and Maura Mahort
provided the punch for Albany in
the meets next event. the
I500-meter run. Jacobs led f'rorn
start to finish with Mahon close in
tow. Jacobs crossed the line in a
time of 5:08], with Mahon follow-
ing her across in 5109.0.

With three freshmen leading the
way, the 400-metcr dash provided
for Albany's second sweep of the
day. Doreen Hutchinson captured
first place with a time of l:03.39.
Mary Carmody and Wanda McFad-
den followed in second and third
with times of l:05.l and l:05.6
respectively. After the 400-meter
dash, .the meet's score stood at
Albany 39. Brockport 2 and the
Danes never looked back.

Brockport finally managed a first

Albany's Barb Shipley and Ginny
Griner placed second and third in
the event. only allowing Brockport
to gain a single point. Griner came
right back to grab a third against
Brockport's talented jumping crew
in the long jump with a leap of
I5'4".

The Dane throwers kept Albany
safely ahead with a one-two finish
in the discus. Andrea Deiaurier cap-
tttred first place with a throw of
IIG‘4“, followed by teammate
Mary Randics in second place with
a throw of 99‘I".

The next two events, the
loo-meter dash and the BOO-meter
run, saw the Danes' Cartnody
across the line in third with a time
of 29.4 seconds.

Jacobs has made her presence felt
early this season as site has won all
five races she has entered thus far,
including the 3000-tneter against
Brockport. her third victory on 05
day. Jacobs ran a solid ll:l4.l to
complete ltcr gruelling l500, 800

In the high jump, Barb Shipley
placed third with an effort of 4’8".
Shipley came, back shortly there
after to take first in thejavelln with
a throw of 98'6".

The Danes 4x4w-meter relay
easily outdistanccd the Brockport
team, taking the event with a time
of 4229.7. Ginny Griner witi. a hop,
step and jump of JI'S”, was good
for a third place finish.

The Danes showed a lot of deter-
mination. along with very good
depth in winning their first meet of
the outdoor season. The Danes are
looking to keep itnproving and are
hoping for the quick return of cap-
tain Karen Kurthy. Ifshe can return
to form quickly after her early
season illness. she would provide
nccdcd depth in the distance events.
The Danes will travel to Bingttam-
ton this Wednesday to participate in
the Bingltamton Invite, a meet they
should have a chance of winning.
