Students granted $300 rent abatement
after suing Ian dlord for heat shortage

By Susan Mltllgan
Three SUNYA students have won $300 in rettt

t abatement because their lattdlord failed to provide

adequate heat.

Albany City Court Justice E. David Duncan deter-
mined al'ter a Mttrch 23 trial that tltc sttidcnts'
landlord. Ajay K. Sanghi. had violated the "watranty
ol‘ httbitahility.“ That law requires landlords to ensure
that no conditions exist itt their rentals that are
dangerous to the life. safety or health of the tcittittts.

The students, Fraitnic Fiss, Bob Dunlcavyattd Leslie
Adler. claimed their Delaware Avc. apartment was in-
adequater licatcd during Novctitbcr atid Decctnbcr iii’
[98], and January titrottgh March oi~ l984.

According to Student Legal Services attorney Mark
S. Mishlcr. who handled tltc case for tltc students.
Sanghi was repeatedly informed ot‘ the Itcat problettt
by the tenants attd tlte Albany City Bureau of Code
Enforcement.

The lack of heat was dtie to “an antiquated heating
system which does not cope well with the Albany
winters," Duncan said itt his decision. Sttnghi at ottc
point gave the tenants three electric space heaters. lint
they did not provide etiotigli heat for tltc apartment.

The three students withltcld March 1984 reitt to
force Sanghi to ﬁx tltc furnace or t)lllt.‘t'\\ist: provide
heat For the apartment.

Satighi sued the tenants t'or l‘ztiltire to pay tciii. the

students filed a counterclaim against Sanglii lor $200
per month for each month the heating problem ex-
isted. The tenants also demanded reimbursement for
heating bills paid to Niagara Mohawk during those
months. .

Duncan ordered the students to pay March rentr but
also granted tlietn partial rent abatement for the first
three iiiotitiis ot‘ the year.

Duncan determined that the “warranty of
habitabiliiy" was violitted only during the months oi‘
January through March, attd awarded the tenants 5 too
a month compensation for a total of $300.

The tenants are ttow only respoitsiblc for the $250
dil‘t'ct'cncc bet weett their Marclt rent and the abatement
awarded them by the cottrt.

ltt addition, Snttghi's warrant of eviction was set
aside.

“Although the lack of ltcat was not so drastic as to
he lit'e-tltt'eatcning." Duncan said, “it would appear
from the evidence that for the months of January.—
February and March of l984 the lack of heat was
enough to adversely affect the lifestyle of lite tenants
who livcd‘in the apartment." _

And while Sanglii demonstrated “good faith" at the
trial. Duncan said, “good faith alone is not sufficient
to tree a landlord from a breach of warranty of
liabitability.“ i l
