Council unanimously approved next year’s
Student Association httdget'. after
eliminating the stipends for the positions of
Off-Campus Coordinator (0CC)‘and' the
proposed Affirmative Actiort Coordinator
for tire I984-85 year. Only [3 of Council's .13

elected members tvere actttttlly present when'

tlte budget tvas passetl. This constittttes a lack

The decision to eliminate the positiotts of

made by (‘ourtcil as pttrt of an effort to cut
down on tile “fatty areas“ itt order to
balattce the budget. said SA (."oittroller

Directors this year. I

Cltcryl ls'altncr. Vice Cltair of ()(‘A‘s

stressing tltat the tnortcy spent to stipend the
()CC is unnecessary. “Tire titaitt argument
for denying (groups) budgets ltas bcctt the

that the OCC attd tlte Off-campus board of

"()t‘llcamptrs students rtced a voice itt the

SUNYA President Vincent ()‘Leary feels the

students."

This past year was tlte first tirtte SA had a
stipcrtdcd off-canirnts coordinator.

A $250 stipend for the cltair of tire off-
catttptrs board of directors wtts added to the
budget. The chair will act as a liasott for off-
cainpus students to the SA executive branch.

()ff-caittpns representative Lauri Cole in-
trodtrced the atrtcndnrent to cttt the proposed
position of Affirmative Actiort Coordinator.
saying sltc felt the job sliottld be performed
by lite Minority Affairs Coordinator. The
Minority Affairs Coordinator sltottld know
the Affiritrative Action policy anyway. she
explained.

"Next year will be a tcstirtg ground attd if

STAFF It’ltl'I‘Lt‘R
It ltas been sixteen years sirtce

. Union Station was the stage for the

sad departures and joyous rcurtiorts
of rail travelers btit now tlte granite
cavern will ottee again resound with
the footsteps and voices. The
Norstar Bettcorp corporation. a
holding company. plans to convert
the station ittto offices for its 300

cntployccs.
Aecordittg to a report lit the
Albany TlIlIL‘.t' Union State arid

Bank officials tittveilcd the plans
for the station‘s rcbirtlt at a press
cortfcrettcc at the station on Broad~
way on April it. The rcttovatiotts

are expected to cost eight million
dollars and take one rind a ltalf
years to complete. Tlte building will
be purchased from the strtte at a
cost of $500,000 bringing the total
cost of the project to cigltt atttl a
ltaif rnilliott dollars. sttid the Times
Union report.

In addition to the reuovtttion of
tire station itself the Times Union
reported tltrtt the city plans to build
a four tttilliott dollar public parking
garage behind the station. Albany
Mayor 'l‘honias Wltalen Ill said

:tltat tlte garage will ltave two levels

with spaces for 900 cars. Accordittg
to Wltalett it will be operated by the
Albatty parking authority.

Researchers find sexual
fantasies commonplace

By Ilene Weinsteln
STAII‘ II’RI'IIER

The average person engages in
sevcrt or eight sexual fantasies a
day. btrl sorite people have as trtany

as 40 or cvcrt tnorc. according to

Psychology Professor David
Barlow.

Barlow. who is the co-dircctor
for tltc Clirtie for Stress ad Anxiety
Disorders. emphasized that "these
are only rough estimates." He
asserted that sotnc sexual thoughts
incltrdcd irt this approximation are
itot “full-blown" and last only a
few seconds.

Most people who engage in sex-
tral thoughts are normal. said
Barlow. “All people Itave different
kinds of sexual fantasies." lie ex-
plained attd added that the frequen-
cy and intensity of these fantasies
are important to study.

The frequency of a fantasy can
ittdicate a psychological problem.
said Barlow. Atnong rapists and
child molesters. the frequency of

 

- DAVE srntcx ups

Intensity of fantasies important

fantasies is very high. and
sometimes sexual thoughts are a
constant obsession throughout the
day. Barlow said he believes that if
someone has a recurrent fantasy 70
to 80 percent of the titnc. he or she
will act on it.

The content of fantasies does not
make them abnormal. Barlow said.
adding that Masters and Johnson,
the leading rcsearclters on sexual
behavior. studied both homosexual
and ltcterosexuals' and heterosex-
uals' sexual thoughts.

“it used to be that a heterosexual
who had a homosexual fantasy
would be diagnosed as a latent
homosexual," he said. Today. it is
considered “perfectly normal” for
heterosexuals to have homosexual
fantasies and vice versa.

However. this type of fantasy is
uncommon. asserted Bartlow.
“The are accidental." lte said. and
added that these thoughts can be
triggered by movies or suggestions.

Barlotv also researched the sexual
fantasies sexual deviants for the
Sexuality Research Prograttt. a
branch of the clinic that lie lteads.
Subjects were referred to the clinic
for stttdy and assessment by mental
health professionals according to
Barlow.

The clinic does have a treatment
program for sex offenders. attd
sorttetimcs refer its patients to tire
New York State Psychiatirc ln-
stitute at Columbia University.
which is closing down this summer.

“There are few treattnent in the
correctional system or outside it for
sex offenders.“ Barlow said.

Barlow and his staff are currently
studying the problctns of male im-
potence and female sexual dysfunc-
tion. he said. Barlow said the clirtic
works primarily to decide if a pro-
blctn is psychological or physical. or
sortie cotttbination of built.

Tltc psychological causes vary
greatly among botlt inch and
wotncn. Barlow explairted. bill the
factors that tnaintairt impotence are
more specific. Men who are impo-
tent will focus on other things
rather than scxttal cues during
lovemaking. he said, adding. “their
mittds will jump frotn one topic to
anotlter. not all of tltcrn sexual."

Among women. Ilte predominant
factors are stressful or traumatic cs-
peric l. involving st ' arid negative
attitudes concerning 'x.

Organic factors maintaining im»
potence range for both nrert and
tvortteri from side effects of various

   
 

medications. such as attri-
hypertensive drugs. to a hidden
vascular insufficiency. which

prevents blood from flowing to the
genitals. explained Barlow.

The patients. who rartgc itt age
frottt 30 to 60. are referred to the
clittic by private pltysicians. usually
urologists. Control subjects are.
also. used. according to Dan
Abrahainson. the Chief Graduate
Student on staff. to compare the
difference in subjective and
physical arousal. SUNYA students
have been used as control subjects
for several semesters. Abrahamson
said.

Patients. Barlow said. are given
physical exams. dctaild interviews.
psychological and physiological
testing of sexual responses to arrive
'at accurate assessments of their pro-
lblcms.

Hardware and equipment are im-
portant in data collection. explain-
ed Abrahamson. Strain gauges and
polygraplts are used to record dif-
ferent hody responses. lte said.

Success rates in cttrittg impotence
vary greatly depending on the pro-
blem. said Barlow. adding that the
ratio reported by Masters and
Johnson are exaggerated. While
Masters and Johnson have reported
a rate of about 75 percent. the
figures “are more like 40 to 50 per-
cent." ltc said.

 

The' city. according to the article.
will furtlter contribute to the
renewal of the area by building a
park across the street from the
building's ctttrance. Whalen said
that plans for tire park itave not yet
been formulated.

Whalen maintaittcd that the plans
for the station will ltave a signifi-
cant effect on Albany. “I think it
will Itavc a dramatic itttpttet on the
revitalization of llraodway aitd
Nortlt Pearl to Clinton Avenue. I
think it will trigger substantial new
construction in the coming
months." the mayor said.

Conunisiuner of the State Office
of General Services. .loltn Egan.
spoke optimistically about the pro-

'ject. "It's great." said Egan. "I.

think it's going to do great things
for downtoer Albany rtttd urban
renewal in general." be tiddcd.
Egan speculated that sotne of the
state offices. rtow located in Col-
onie. may eventually tnovc to the
downtown area. “At the moment
nothing is cast irt bronze." caution-
ed Egan. “it‘s all speculative. You
want what will work out best for the
agency and the people involved."
According to Whalcn. construc-
tion on the station will begin as
soon as the title can be transferred

Union Station to be revitalized by $8.5M plan

«from the state to Norstar. “In as lit-

tle as 30 days." speculated the
Mayor.

The renovation plans. according
to the Titties Union, were designed
by Steven Einhorn of the architec~
tural firm Einhorn. Yttffc. Prescott.
and Krouner. Einhorn was quoted
iii the Times Union as saying “We
will build a ttctv building inside this
building attd keep within the
historical fabric of the station."

According to the Tintcs Union
the Beans arts classical style
buildittg was erected 84 years ago by
the New York Cctttral Railroad.
The rcttovttlcd station will ltave a
pttblie meeting roortt. corporate of-
fices. a data processing ttttit. aitd
other Norstrtr traits. Ttvo mezzanine
floors will increase the total usable
office space front 56.000 to 86.000
square feet. “An open tnttltilevel
lobby will provide a view of the cell-
ittg with its recessed panels and or-
nate cast iron mezzanine
structures." reported the Times
Union.

News

The Knickerbocker

reported that the Norstar-Bencorp
corporation will sell its Western
Ave. headquarters and State St. of-
fices and tnove into the newly

 

renovated station by the spring of
1986.

The Norstar Bencorp plan in-
itiated by bank president. Peter
Kicrnan, is the least expensive of
several plans which have arisen
within the past few years.

According to the Titties Union.
Lewis Swyer planned to spend l00
million dollars to bitild shops.
restaurants. a hotel arid a 30 tloor
office building within the station
and the surrounding area.

Wltctt this plan was thwarted by
financing problems it was scaled
dotvtt to include a 20 tloor office
building to be used by the state.
Late in l982 this second plan was
laid to rest because tltc office rent
would have been too expensive for
the state.

In late I983 IBM planned to
spend 10 ntillion dollars to convert
the station ittto a corporate head-
quarters. In January. however.
IBM decided that the historic status
of the edifice presented preserva-
tion problems which did not fit in
with the corporation's plans. The
Times Union said that Kiernan
decided to take a look at the station
after hearing about IBM’s failed
plan on a late-night T.V. newscast.
