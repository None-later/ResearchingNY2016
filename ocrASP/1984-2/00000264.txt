POI-itical experts, debate ‘
socialist, capitalist ideals

By Aileen Brown
STAFF WRITER

Capitalism. not socialism. is incompatible
with democracy, according to SUNYA
Political Science Professor Bruce Miroff.

Miroff participated in a forum Wednesday
night which pitted professors defending the
“freedom” of capitalism against those pro-
moting the “democracy” of socialism.

The forum. which was sponsored by tile
Democratic Socialists of America anti
mediated by group member lirian Van (irol.
began wilit a statcrttent from history pro-
l‘cssor Donald liirn. who defended the tltcory
of a dctnocratic socialist government, which
would combine all the democratic ideals in a
socialist government.

“Socialism to the is a method to back
democracy" Birn began. “l'm concerned
with increasing freedom. not in an esoteric
sense, bill in the very real settse in which we
understand freedom to mean today."

Birn went on to explain the backgrounds
of socialism, and ltow certain events
developed the idea and theory of socialism.
According to Birn. there are two basic no-

tions of socialism which were indicated by .

two major revolutions. the French Revolu-
tion. and the industrial Revolution. “The
French Revolution was a battle for freedom
and democracy." he said. “And the in-
dustrial Revolution was one of technological
promise. These two revolutions, to an extent,
reconstructed politics. We ltave to grapple
with the inpaet of these two revolutions."

Birn ended his initial statement by stressing
the impact and effects socialism has on socie-
ty. He emphasized the benefits to be derived
from a socialist form of government~ the in-
creased freedom of choice in certain areas. a
greater ability to plan government, and more
benefits for a greater number of people.

“We have to see socialism as an extension
of democracy" Birn stated. “Socialism can
extend democracy while keeping democratic
freedoms. There is a choice before us in the
next century. and we have to ask ourselves if
the choices we make are ones that will in-
crease our freedom and entrance our lives.
Socialism, like democracy. is the appropriate
response for the century ahead."

Speaking in opposition to Birn was History
Department Professor Richard Kendall. Ken-
dall defended capitalism in terms of the op-
portunity it offers. Kendall based his theory
defending capitalism on the adage “ifit ain't
broke, don‘t fix it," saying that capitalism
had worked for our society successfully in the
past.

“l’tn primarily interested in freedom."
Kendall began. “freedom, and mobility.
America is a place of mobility. you can start
at the bottom and move up. In terms of
freedom and mobility. this society has pro-
vided a great deal of botlt. These are primari-
ly economic questions. but most of them are
also part of a larger social and political
culture.”

Kendall also talked about capitalism and
society saying that capitalism is an important
outlet for social energy. “it seems to me that
it it. important to the system and our
economic functioning that capitalism is com-
petitive. To me. competition is important. it
produces better goods and service, and
enables us to give vent to our energies. This

provides for a healthier society." he explain-
ed. '

in terms of the future. Kendall cautioned
that we should learn from our mistakes and
proceed slowly. “in looking ahead. i think
we should proceed cautiously. and very slow-
ly. Any adjustments we make should be
made slowly and with caution.“ he said also.

Miroff advocated socialism, stressing the
ties between socialistn and democracy.

“There is a strong relationship between
capitalism. socialism and democracy" Miroff
said. "To link socialism with democracy is
considered unusual. odd. Most Americans
equate socialism with undemocratic and
authoritative rule. It is not. it is also not
socialism that is incompatible with
democracy. it is capitalism that is incompati-
ble. Capitalism was once compatible with
democracy. when it used to be small scale
and genuinely competitive. with numerous
goods."

Miroff asserted that capitalism as a corti-
pctitive systcrrn no longer exists, that it has
been replaced by a non-competitive form of
corporate capitalism. “We now have a
system of corporate capitalism." Miroff
said.

“it is dominated by large corporate entities
which have a stranglehold over democracy."
he explained. “Corporations in America en-
joy a privileged position in both business and
politics. Corporations in our society make
the critical decisions. Our modern govern-
ment is forced to be solicitors of the cor~
poratc sector.” said Miroff.

Miroff said that not only does business
have a structural bias in society. it also con-

trols society in indirect ways by contributing ‘

to campaigns. lobbying and controlling the
mass media. it is this domination of business.
said Miroff. that prevents capitalism front
being democratic. since the people’s interests
are not primary.

“The key problem is that the primary
questions of society such as work life,
technology, distribtion of income. wealth
and property are not part of the public agen-
da under capitalism" Miroff said.
“Capitalism daoes not allow these decisions
to be made by the people.”

Miroff concluded his introductory state-
ment by advocating Democratic Socialism in
response to the problems of government and
scoiety today. “Democratic Socialism is tak-
ing the idea of democracy seriously." he said.
“it is not a regime to control everything, it is
a way to open up deomeracy in all areas
where it has been driven out. it is taking the
public control over investment decisions out
of the hands of the capitalist elite. it is new
forms of economic life such as cooperatives
and employee ownership of the means of
production. it is more freedom. more equal
rights," Miroff contended.

To conclude the introductory statements.
Political Science Professor Morton
Schoolman argued for the Capitalists side.
Seitoolman said that the debate is not bet’
ween capitalism and socialism, it is a chance
to break away from the dichotomy between
the two theories.

“Socialism and capitalism can be
assimilated." Schoolman asserted. “it is im-
perative. however, that we retain the prac-
