Mental illness in prisons around
the country Is on the upswing. ac-
cording to SUNYA Criminal
'Justice' Professor Fred Cohen. -
Cohen. who is studying the con-

stitutional rights of mentally ill and
mentally retarded convicts, explain-
ed that overcrowding is a primary
reason for the increase in this il-
lness. “The noise level. victimiza-
tion by other prisoners. and
idleness" contribute to the unstable
conditions of many prisoners. said
Cohen. I

Cohen's research is part of a state
Department of Corrections pro-
gram to review professional stan-
dards that should be maintained by
people who work with mentally ill
inmates, according to Brian McCar-
thy. a program specialist for the
corrections department.

-New York State has received a

grant from the National institute of
Corrections, an agency of the
Justice Department. to develop a
research manual for corrections of-
ficcrs. mental health workers. and
policy makers nation-wide. explain-
ed McCarthy.
Administrative and programmatic
practices are being studied, in addi~
tion to legal perspectives which are
being researched by Cohen. said
McCarthy.

The manual, which will be
published this summer. will simply
be a resource for individual states to
help them run their corrections
departments. “The N.l.C. (Na-
tional Institute of Corrections) does
not have any legal mandates." ex-
plained McCarthy.

Preliminary results have been
presented by Cohen and McCarthy
to the National Academy of’Corrcc-

tions in‘ Boulder. Colorado.
Statistics. .which have been compil-
ed from a natin-wide survey of cor-
rections departments, have revealed
that six percent of today's inmates
are mentally ill and two-and»a-half
percent are mentally retarded. ac-
cording to McCarthy.

Cohen said that mental hospitals ’

have deiristltutionalizcd their pa-

tients by about 50 percent in recent

years. which leads to fewer people
being put into mental hospitals. In

' turn. Cohen said, “they are show-
ing up in prisons."

The reason for this dcinstitu-
tionalization, according to Cohen is
the general belief that mental
hospitals don't do much good. ‘It is
very difficult. legally. to get people
admitted to these institutions, he
said. Cohen explained that the law
is that a person "must be mentally
ill and extremely dangerous" in
order to be placed in a hospital.

A sytttptotn of mental illness in
prisons is “acting out". according
to Cohen. “There secms to be a
great deal of data about self-
mutilation and self-violence"
among prisoners. he added.

According to McCarthy. varia-
tions in programming exist nation-
wide. “Some states keep mentally
disturbed people in prisons and
some states transfer them to mental
offices.” he said. He noted that
there arel‘ew services for mentally
retarded people. and that few
retarded people are transferred.
“TheyIusually stay in corrections."
he added.

Cohen. on the other hand.
argued that New York State is a
leader in the field of inmate treat-
ment. “There are more varied
resottrccs and programs for mental-
ly disordered prisoners." he ex-

plained._ 1

Eight prisons in New York have
community mental health programs
and satellite programs which pro-
vide drugs and treatment. in-
lermediate care units also exist to
service people with less serious men-
tal illnesses. said Cohen.

He explained that the com v
tional basis for prisoners’ 'gut

amendments in the US. Constit

names of the campaigners and more
evidence to go on.

Another dispute centered around
a section of SA's election policy
that forbidss any “stockpiling of
(campaign)supp|ics" in the SA of-
fice. Helium tanks that were stored
in the SA office were apparently us-
cd to inflate balloons for Schal'l'er‘s
campaign.

Schaffer said the tanks were left
over from an Olympic Hopefuls
committee event, and were purchas-
ed by him as he rcmoved thcnt from
tthSA office on the day they were
uScd. Schaffcr asserted that Gregg
Stackcl. who works on Schafl'cr’s
campaign and runs the Olympic
Hopefuls committee offered the
helium tanks to him Sunday night,
April is, and he bought them Mon-

, day April i6.

Although Schaffer‘ narrowly beat
him in the first election, Hallock

said he was “cautiously confident" I
that he would win the runoff. "I
certainly feel that the small margin
would have been more than made
up if the polls had opened at the ap-
propriate time," Hallock asserted.
Schaffcr. who defeated Hallock
on Indian Quad, where the polls
opened late. disagreed with
Hallock. “if the polls were Open
earlier on Indian Quad l’d have
done even better." Schafl‘cr said.
McCann has said he plans to
campaign with Hallock on dinner
lines and is urging all McCann sup-
porters to vote for Hallock. Mc-
Cantt. who drew 7 percent of the
vote. said he had “no regrets"
about running for SA president.
Auletta officially took office as
SA Vice President Thursday morn-
ing. “It was a very easy transition."
she said. adding. “I hope to
upgrade the position of Vice Presi-
dent next year. I don't plan on tak-
ing a back seat to the president."
She declined to express support for
either presidential candidate.
