Members of SUNYA‘s Interna-
tional Film Group opened a bottle
of champagne Thursday night and
toasted their 30th anniversary. just
moments before the projectors roll.
cd for their last show ever.

IFG. along with several other
groups did not receive SA funding
for next year. according to SA Cort-
troller Adam Barsky.

"We didn't ask (SA) for funding
because we knew SA didn't have
the money." said ll-‘(i trctrsrrrcr
Rhoda Spira. ll~'Cr's equipment
treeded to be replaced. and [Hi
would have needed a much larger
budget to do this. she explained.

"Tire cqrriptncnt broke. and SA
did not have tltc funds to replace
everything.“ explained IFG Presi~
dent Deborah Sarrirr. adding that
“there really wasn‘t anything
anyone could do. The equipment
would have been rrurch too expert-
sive to replace."

The decision of whetircr or not to
fund a group depends on what that

group has done during the year. and
how successful its activities were.
explained Brasky.

The Social Alternative. which
was originally the controversial
‘lletcroscxuai. Alliance‘ was not
eligible for funds. said liarsky.

Tltc group's nrain purpose would
have hecti to upgrade social events.
while dccnrplrasi/ing the use of
alcohol. according to group Presi-
dent Mike Butler.

“SA said the group was a
duplication of other goups." said
llrrtlcr. “Other groups though.
always ctupltasi/c alcohol for social
events. We were trying to change
this." he added.

No appeal will he made on SA's
decision. llrrtlcr said.

NADIR. a SUNYA literary arts
"raga/inc. will receive funding for
next year. “after a battle." said
editor Micheal Benson.

SA had suggested that NADIR be
combined with the Albany Review.
