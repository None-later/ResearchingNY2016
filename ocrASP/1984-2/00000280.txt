SUNYA students' constitutional rights
may- be infringed upon in a section of the
SUNYA rules and regulations guidelines. ac-
cording to Student Association lawyer Mark
Mishlcr.

The rules, procedures, and expectations of
behavior. which are established by the ad-
ministration and listed in the Student
Guidelines, are complicated and often
unclear. said Mishler. He raised questions
about several sections of the Guidelines, in-
cluding the “Compliance Section," wlticlt he
said could possibly conllict witlt the Fifth
Amendment.

The section says that arty student who fails
to cotnpty with the directions of any in-
dividual with authority over a facility or
furtction of the Univcrisly is subject to
disciplinary action, which means referral to a
Judicial Board.

Misltlcr.

dent to answer questions. said Mishlcr. If the
studetrt refuses, lie/she could then he charged
with bcittg “uncooperative,” he said.

A University Judicial Board “may take it
negative inference from silence. whereas
speaking could incrintinatc the student," said
Mishlcr. “The Constitution is relevatit
because SUNYA is a State institution," he
added.

One referred student called the system
“double jeopardy."

“Students' rights should be clearer about
whether they're required to comply with
SUNYA police, and whether this compliance
would be held against them if they're brought
to criminal court." said former Judicial
Board member Jeff Emdin.

Students are allowed to bring an advisor to
their hearing, but that advisor is at no time
allowed to speak for them at the hearing, ac-
cording to the Gttlde/t'rres.

According to President of the SUNYA
Pre-Law Association Richie Golubow, the
little-known Judicial Referral Peer Con-
sultants Service on cantpus provided students
the opportunity before the hearing to discuss
the procedure with a student consultant.
“We're not permitted to act as lawyers and
we don't pretend to," said Golubow. In-
