Gray. Thc President tlilti VlCL‘ Presi-

by the establishment 01' a gay and
lesbian center, and which is actively
participating in the institution 01'
such a center is the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance (GALA).

GALA members have both cn-
courang and participated in the
proposal of and the establishment
ol‘ the center. “I can foresee a lot of
involvement by GALA." said
GALA chairman Rod Silver.

Silver and GALA mcmbcr Jim
Gicnn are both serving on the
Board overseeing the development
ot‘ccntcr.

Gicnn commented that lie would
like to see the center work towards
eliminating some misconceptions
and hostility towards homosexuali-
ty.

Silver also commented that he
hopes the center will work against
hostility and homophobia.

"I would like to scc the center
work on issues of homophobia. and
try to settle some roots in so Iqu lht:
center can be perpetuated nt'lcr onc
year." said Silver. "I would also
like to set: the nbolishmcnt of any
homophoqu at SUNYA. and it
growth in thc nworcncss on campus
so that! people can bc morc accep-
ting ot‘ homosexuality." hc said.

The Chicago Resource Ccnlcr
originally approached SUNYA with
the idcn for a grant. said Jenkins.

“The grant proposal was in-
littllcti through a series 0!" meetings
ilnli discussions about ways to com-
bat the problems of homophobia.
which is an irrational fear of
homosexuality." said Jenkins.
“The proposle was developed after
consultation with approximately 55
faculty and stall" members ot‘ thc
university. including the ad-
ministrution. academic areas.
