' Survey finds so

' By Rick Swanson
r smrr warren
Sophomores at SUNYA have the lowest in-

', come per month out of all the four classes,

according to a recent survey.

The survey. conducted by SUNYA senior
Larry Merscrcau, found that sophomores at
SUNYA have monthly incomes only two-
thirds that of freshmen, and almost one-half
that ofjuniors and seniors.

Mersereau interviewed one hundred

SUNYA students last month. in an effort to
find out how students obtain their income
and where they spend it. .
. Merscreau, an intern for Fact Finders.
which is a polling firm, speculated that the
drastic decline in income from freshmen,
who receive $372 per month, to sophomores.
who receive $289 per month. was due to "a
decrease in parental support."

“Parents probably figure. ‘l gave him a lot
of money last year (freshman year). i think
he can live on less this year'," said
‘ Mersereau.

Merscreau also found in his survey that,
per month. the average SUNYA student has
$253 in “discretionary cash," that is. extra
cash to spend after expenses have been paid
for. The amount of spending money, or
“discretionary cash,” did not vary much bet-
ween classes.

Surprised by such a high amount of spen-
ding cash, Mcrscreau concluded that the
body of SUNYA students “would be a feasi-
ble market for prospective merchants."

The average SUNYA student receives most
of his/her income from parents or from the

banks, Mersereau found.

Mcrsereau also discovered in his survey t
that 63 percent of the student body was not
employed. According to the survey, 37 per-
cent of SUNYA‘s student body held jobs -—
22 percent living on campus, 15 percent living
of f-campus.

Merscreau said he learned that as a stu-
dent’s job income increased, parental sup-

Steve Ribncr, who owns Fact Finders. said
he was impressed with Mersereau’s findings.
especially with the discovery that the average

New roof will stop water damage

The plastic spread out across the top of t
curls ripping acrossrthc roof are all part of the work to install a ncw, insulated roof which
would hull \vutcr leakage and damage in the building.

According to Dennis Stevens. Director of the University's Physical Plant, the effect the
lcukagc has had on the library is “evident by the stacks of books covered with plastic to

Associates, which offered the lowest bid at $222,639. The crew should have the roof fully

stopping the leakage temporarily. However, more must be done. Stevens explained “It is
the sun and its ultravioch rays that destroy the roof, not the water. The new insulation will
protect the roof from the ultra-violet rays so the membrane cart conccntrntc on keeping out

Built in l964, the old roof's deterioration is not a result of faulty construction, Stevens
said. The original roof was only intended to last 20 years. Because of changing technology,
new materials are being used to create the new roof; as a result the new roof should last

The new roof will also reduce the library's heat loss. “Just as people lose heat out the top
of their head, buildings lose heat through their roof" Stevens said. He said the new roof
should make the library more "energy conservation efficient."

Thc roof of the library is just one of many roof-repairs on campus. Over the past few
years, ncw roofs have been installed in the Social Science, Education, Humanities, Physics,
Chemistry, and llinlogy buildings. as well as the Campus Center.

The University has received New York state funding to repair the roofs of five additional
buildings on the podium, said Stevens. Construction will begin this summer on the roofs of
the [Earth Science, Fine Arts and Business Administration buildings and the Performing

Arts Center, Stevens said. The new roofs will also prevent damage to the buildings and will

‘W’ protest planned

Student Action Chair Steve Guwlcy said he
is coordinating a studcnl protest against the
proposed “W” grade. The Univcsity Senate
will vote on the proposal Monday, May 7.
Students are rcprcscnted in the Senate, but
Cowley said he hopes five or six students who
are not Senators will be allowed to speak on
the “W” during the meeting.

Gawlcy hopes to attract about 50 students
to the meeting. but he said it will be difficult
to recruit students because classes will be over
at the time of the meeting.

According to Gawley, the goal of the pro-
test is to send the proposal back to the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing. If the “W” is
approved, students will receive “W"s on
their transcripts if they drop courccs after 10
days. If they drop courses before the tenth
day, nothing will appear on their transcripts.

If the proposal is not sent back to the corn-
mittee, Gawley said an alternate plan will be
proposed that allows for “one penalty-free
drop per semester."

News Updates

 

students had a “tremendous potential." yet

undiscovered by local Albany merchants.
To discover the total amount of money
brought into the Albany area by SUNYA
students, Ribner said it would be necessary to
multiply the average monthly income per stu—
dent. 5253. by the number of students‘at
SUNYA. "You're talking a lot of bucks," he
added. Cl

 

Blll links TAP, draft

Legislation has been introduced in the
State Assembly that would result in the
elimination of all state aid to students who
are eligible to register with the Selective Ser-
vice but fail to do so.

The bill, introduced by R. Stephen Hawley
(R-Batavia), would require that all students
applying for aid through Tuition Assistance
Program (TAP) provide Selective Service in—
formation.

"lfsomc students cannot abide by the laws
of our land, they certainly should not expect
to reap the benefits of the state's financial
assistance to further their education." stated
Hawlcy in a press release.

ASUBA chair named

Laurie Midgcttc was elected chair of the
Albany State University Black Alliance
(ASUBA) at it's Wednesday night mccting.
Cheryl Pcmbcrton won the vice chair elec-
tion.

The election results “thrilled” Student
Association Vice President Suzy Aulettn. She
said that it was important that women were
being chosen to head SA-l'undcd groups.
