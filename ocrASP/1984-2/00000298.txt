 launches cam-m
against drunken drivers

By Eric thdln
srarr warren

Despite new statistics that show 'a
decrease in alcohol related car ac-
cidents among 18 year old drivers
since New York raised Its drinking
age to 19.” student leaders say they
do not believe the legal age should
be raised to 2|.

The Student Association of the
State University (SASU), which
represents over JBOJXJO students,
believes it has a more positive and
effective anvaer to these problems.
SASU President James Tierney an-
nounced Wednesday morning. He
outlined the formation of a new
Alcohol Awareness Camgaign.
which will be part. Tierney said, of
an ongoing educational effort to
take intoxicated drivers off the
highway.

According to Tierney. SASU’s
program will directly attack the
problem of driving while intoxicted,
rather than simply blame and
punish young adults through what
he called “selective prohibition."

Efforts to get drunk drivers off
the road. Tierney claimed. have
wrongly focused attention on rais-
ing the drinking age to 2|. A higher
drinking age. Tierney asserted. will
leave a vast majority of drunk
drivers untouchedI uneducated,
and unrehabilitated.

SUNYA Student Association
President Rich Schaffcr said
SASU’s alcohol awareness catn-
paign would not be implemented
“until the fall." The programs
would center around teaching tltc
responsibilities and effects of
alcohol abuse.

Schaffer said he had not spoken
much with Tierney on the issue.
but. he added. “I know we're going
to be discussing it at tile .lune SASU
Conference."

The program. Schaffer said. is
important because “it will show the
supporters of the 21 drinking
age...that we're willing to take
responsibility."

In addition to the Alcohol
Awareness Campaign, SASU ad-
vocates tougher drunk driving laws.
and stricter enforcement of laws
such as sobriety check points. man-
datory seat belt laws. and educative
and rehabilitative programs,
Tierney said. These programs. said
Tierney. are proven methods which
would be more effective than a hike

- in the state’s drinking age.

These programs would nor
punish the vast majority of young
people who are responsible drivers.
Tierney asserted. According to
SASU ﬁgures, 99.6 percent of all to
and 20 year olds never get involved
in alcohol related accidents.

A report by the state division of
Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse.
also released Wednesday morning.
found that alcohol related accidents
decreased 25 percent for 18 year
olds during the ﬁrst 12 months
following the state's December 1982
drinking age hike. Alcohol related
accidents decreased only 3.8 percent
for drivers over 18 during that same
period. according to the report.

This statistic, according to Divi-
sion Director Robert V. Shear,
should be evidence enough to per-
suade state politicians who are
against the proposed raise that it 21
year old drinking age would save
more lives.

Tierney said he doesn't tltittk the
2| year old drinking age will he
made law. though Governor Mario
M. Cuomo is known to support the
proposed raise. Assembly Speaker
Stanley Fink and Senate Majority
Leader Warren Anderson have both
said they oppose any change in lhc
drinking age.

Public opinion polls reveal that
70 percent of the people .SlIrYL‘M‘tl
favor the proposed raise.

Senator Frank l’udtttntt.
(R-Quccns), and Assembly mcmhct
Melvin Zimmcr. (D-Syrucusc). ilil\L‘
introduced bills to raise the think-
ing age.

Wltilc acknowledging lllc
decrease in alcohol related ﬂCClthIll\
among 18 year olds since the 1‘) ycttt
old age was implemented. 'l'icrnct
said that at the time the raise \\‘tl\
approved, the state launched many
other campaigns aimed at dtttttk
drivers. .

Measures such as sobriety check
points and television commercials
educating people about the consc-
qucnces of a DWI arrest may hc
partly responsible for the decrease
in accidents involving 18 year olds.

The actual statewide SASU
Alcohol Awareness Campaign will
be highlighted by several major lic-
tivities on SUNY campuses this ycar
and next. according to ptuttphlcts
outling [the program.

New data fuels drive for
21' drinking age proposal

_ Albany
(AP) A top state official says the
number of fatal crashes involving
18-year-old drinking drivers fell by
4?. percent in the 12 months after
New York's legal drinking age went
from 18 to 19.

Robert Shear, director of the
slate Division of Alcoholism and
Alcohol Abuse, told a news con-
ference Wednesday that the number
of 18-year-olds involved in alcohol-
rclated crashes decreased by 25 per-
cent dttring the same period.

New York‘s legal drinking agtu
ut-iclt hud hcctt lit since the cud ct
Prohibition. was raised to 1‘) iii
December 1982.

Shear and state Senator [frank
Padavan. R-Qltecns. said. the new
data provided the strongest
evidence to date for raising the legal
drinking age to 21 as sought by
Padavan and Governor Mario
Cuomo.

Shear said that while the number
of alcohol-related crashes and fatal
crashes was down for all age groups
in 1983, there was a “powerful age-
specific effect" among the 18-year-
old group.

For instance, while the number of
alcohol-related crashes among

 

18-year-olds was down 25 percent.
it was down by TR pcrccnl for
drivers over 18, he said.

An aide to Shear said the number
of fatal crashes imolving tit-ycttt-
old drinking drivers fell itt 1983
from 45 to 26 with 25 t'cncr people
killed in those crushes.

"It is negligent for its to dilly-
dolly arty longer in lnl mg the IlL'\l
logical step." said l'ttttttuttt nt' ttIi\-

"I think we've done that today,"
said Padavan of the new data.

“We can no longer delay the im-
plementation of a 21-year-old
drinking age - a delay that would
result in needless loss of life and
human suffering," said Shear in a
statement issued at the news con-
ference he and Padavan held. [:1
