Geffner said he had noticed that

Rich Schaffer."

The poll watchers on Alumni did
not stop this. Geffner said.

“i explained to Tom Busby about
this and he totally ignored it." said
Hallock.

Geffner maintained that he did
not support a presidential can-

the runoff election.

V‘ (Sale House proposal awaits Pogus's approval

Albany City community organiza-
tions.

The task force recommended that
Safe House applicants be interview-
ed at their. home by the coordinator
and staff persons. After a thorough
investigation. if the applicant is
deemed suitable. said Auletta. a se.
cond interview will be held. At that
time the “Safe House" would
receive its decal. instructional infor-
mation and emergency phone
numbers. and the residents will be
instructed that they are not legally
responsible to help anyone.

"You are taking a risk (as a Safe
House). What looks like a genuine
emergency could be made up." said
Karlson. but she added. “The risks
are not any different from being a
homeowner now."

“There is no way to design a pro-
ject like this that can totally avoid
possible liability in any situation,"
said SA Attorney Mark Mishler.

for him on the Alumni Quad dinner
lines.

Hallock also complained of pro»
blems on State Quad. where. he
said, members of Schaffer's staff
had been alloWed to campaign in
places members of his own staff
had not been permitted to cam-
paign.

Schaffer maintained that he had
proof of violations committed by
Hallock and Hallock's staff. but
that he would not present them to
the Court unless the Court attempts
to “throw me out“ of the race.

“1 am ready to bring depositions
signed by people who saw" viola-
tions committed by Hallock's cam-
paign staff. said Schaffer. “but I'm.‘
not going to bring them up unless
things get really hairy." "

Hallock said that if “the election
commission had been unbiased."
the race would have been closer.

"If the program and screening
process are carefully designed and
administered in a consistent man.
ner. and participants are given
careful instruction. then any risk is
low on the part of the Unitersity
SA. and student groups." tan;
Mishler.

University President Vincent
O'Leary said, "The proposal was
sent to Vice President Poguc to
consult and review; when it is for.
warded i will act as soon as i can. if
it is a feasible proposal. it “ill be
implemented in the fall.”

"It's a big step for Student Af-
fairs and the University because it is
the ﬁrst outreach into the com.
munity that's not a door-to-door
survey or a Party in the Park." said
Karlson.

“The program will be successful
if community members care and get
involved with it." Auletta said. [J

wholeheartedly say it's true" that
he would have won the election “if
the infractions had not occurred."

Hallock will become president. he
said he believes “it would be a very

that, if you can make some sense of
a story or an article of the chaos of
the world- get something straight
and write it and pass it along to
people- the same kind of thing that
even poets and novelists do," he ex-
