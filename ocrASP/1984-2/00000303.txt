State Quad sold for use
as correctional institution

By Jane Anderson
.\’i iti‘ll ii. i' l,ll(t.\‘i:‘ Lit/lull

New York State commandeered
State Quad for use as it ittnxittttitti
security prison, iii a surprising
University-Correctionul Deptirt-
incnt exchange announced Mon-
day.

The SUNY system will receive
several Bcllcviic Mental Hospital
residents in the swap. according to
SUNYA President Nti/io Lccry.
They will assume untiiimcd posi-
tions liiglt in the university tid-
ttiinistrution. 'stlld Lccry.

"Students are ordered to remove
their belongings by 5 p.tn. Friday.“
l.ecry,stiid at a luncheon press con-
ference Thursday. where itc handed
over the quad keys to Corrections
Department representative Hugh
"Death Row" Murphy.

“We had hoped that State Quad
residents would pack their things
and leave quietly." said Lccry.
“We didn't want any trouble over
this." added Murphy.

Murphy explained to the
assembled media representatives
that the dortnitory buildings would
need very little overhauling.

"The rooms are the perfect size
for our inmates in solitary. and the
building cvcn looks like a prison
already." he observed.

"We will want to bring in our
own cafeteria staff." Murplty add-
ed, “nnd much better quality
food."

“We

could never serve this
he stiid. referring to his

plate. "in one ot‘ otir jails. The in-
mates would kill us instantly."

"We'll of" course install a barbed

wire fence to protect the inmates
l'roin our students." Lccry
reassured Murphy.
' Student Association President
Riclt Lowcnbritu said he was "all
for it. This will force l.500 students
out into apartments iii the Albany
comnuinity. It will giic us (SA)
sitclt an advantage when we
iicgotitiie with tltc city."

Witctt questioned about the
rights of the students in the dor-
mitories. Lowenbruu contended.
“()h. they'll just be studying for
finals. They won't care where they
o.‘

Resident Assistants. who can opt
to become security guards in the
new prison, began moving the re-
maining Students out of the
buildings at 4 a.m. Friday.

One student complained of being
awakened from a sound sleep. "on-
ly to find this guy with tatoos
throwing his stuff under my room-
mate's bed. He pulled a blade on
me. and i got out fast."

Onc inmate. when questioned,
said, “Hell. we‘re a better class of
people than what they had here
before."

Twenty-three RAs. and the entire
staff of the Residential Life Office.
including directors, assistant direc-
tors. clerks. secretaries and
junitors. would not comment when

Alan’s 'mother joins him and his

never met. but resembles in many
respects.

Cher is stipcrb as the homely

Another finc performance coittcs

and his performance is admirable.
Still. it is hard to like Kline after
seeing a dried out I'in fall out ot' his
back pocket as he leaves the
funeral.

Glenn Close turns in such an
amazing performance that we can
almost forgive her i'or playing the
woman that gave birth to Robin
Williams in Corp.

The movie is a technical marvel.
The cinematography is excellent;
especially when they trick you into
thinking that the plane is going to
hit the power plant btit instead
turns into a capsule that orbits the

But the real stair here is the
musical score. included titnong the

Opinions among present student athletes

saw no compelling reason for tltc change in
terms of sliidcnts' interests.

Benny Andch will be Chan in fraternities
from Phi Slama lame to Delfa Sigma Pi.
The former Houston basketball star will be
transferring to Albany because of the pro-
blents he had last season with Coach Guy
(how do you teach players how to shoot foul
shots?) Lewis. Anders quit the team and said
hc‘eould not play for Lewis anymore.

How could I play for a coach who can’t
even hold a towel." said Anders at a press
Conference early this morning.

' i left because they don't understand me
In Houston. The place depressed me. i was in
a constant state of funk." he added.
Albany Head Coach Dick Sours put “Big”
Al Zuckman, his number one recruiting guy.

. on the job.

“i was really excited to get Benny for the
Equad." said "Big" Al. "i think he may even
c able to make varsity."
l When asked what recruiting tactics he used
:80! Anders to go down to Division ill.
0uckman said, “it was easy. First i went
4 wn to Houston. l hung out on the street
".d found Out where to find Benny. Then I
Ought him a Cadillac and we cruised back
ere and i taught him how to dunk —- he was
sally into that. Then I hooked him up at

night and the rest was history."
Anders also said that he was excited to play
for a good coach for a change. "That Guy

didn't know what the hell he was talking ﬂ"

about. his main theory was to take foul shots
with your eyes closed. He was also into mak-
ing stupid passes against pressure. I
remember one game. ltc said ‘Bcnny you
don't pass it to someone on our team against
pressure. just stand there and hold it. You
might lose me my image.‘ "

Anders will have to work extremely hard to
make Albany's Varsity. The team has only
lost one player to graduation. Wilson
Thomas. They will also have the addition of
Fields Blanchard and some junior varsity
players: Rich Chapman. Duane Corlcy and
Curtis Oliver.

“i don't know tiow l'll get passed Pete

Gosulc. Greg Hart. John Mracek and Adam President Nunzlo
