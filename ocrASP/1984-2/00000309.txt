it was another heartbreaking loss
for the Albany State lacrosse team
this post Wednesday afternoon out

on University Field. For the second ‘

time in the-last three games. tlte lax-
men saw their comeback bid fall
short in overtime. But this time. it
took three extra periods to do in the
Danes.

Albany bowed to Division I Col-
gate by a score of 7-6 as the team's
record fell to 6-6. The opening half
was promising. as-the Danes held a
.4-2 halftime advantage. Don
Casadonte tallied twice in the open-
ing stanza. and second quarter
goals by Dave Cerny and Gary
Weisner provided‘ the scoring
pttnch. . '

vln.the second half. it was Col
gate's turn to strike; four
unanswered goals made the score
6-4. in favor of Colgate. Once
again. Albany was faced with a
familiar situation: they had to eorue
from behind in order to. win. And
once again. the Danes came
through. Fourth quarter goals by
John Norris and BobVenier tied tip
the game and set it irtto the first
four-minute overtime.”

Albany Head Coach Gary Camp-

bell stated. "The kid.s'_.showed they
have the ability. character. and
determination to come back.
They've done it all season;"-
. The first two ﬁovertimes went
scoreless, as botlt tentns tnissed op-‘
portunitcs to score. In the third
overtime period. both 'tertms
squandered chances to win by not
connecting on the power play.

"We had a two-man advantage
and couldn't score." said Camp-
bell. “You can't do that arid expect
to win. Right after that (the

day and Sunday. Nineteen teams

at our facilities.

- Cortland. third as a team at the
Nationals last year. is heavily
favored to take the tneet. Heading
Cortland's effort ‘will be returning
All-Americans Tracy Armstead and
Ellen Block. Armstead was the
Division III champion in both the

while Block placed sixth in the na-

The meet will start at 2:45 on

pect any problems. "We haven't
run a_meet along with Mayfest
before. but there should not be
trouble." said While. in fact I think
the competitors will enjoy the at-
mosphere. Trials and semis for nitr-

Saturday's competition. The only
final on Saturday will be the 10.000

finals of all the rest of the events
will be held Sunday starting at l:00.

The Danes are going to be hard
pressed to score points in a meet
this size. as the depth that helps the
team in a dual meet situation will
not be a factor in such a large meet.

The Danes do however have a
group of individuals who should
fare very well this weekend. Lynn
Jacobs will be competing in both
the 10.000-meter and 3000-meter
runs. and if this talented
sophomore has a good weekend on
the track. she could place highly in
both. In the l0.000-meter rrrn

Hartwick, who scored only two points. was
never a factor lit the meet. Tire Union Dut-
