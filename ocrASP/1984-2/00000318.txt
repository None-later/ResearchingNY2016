Conklin with Albany: ’as always awinner

University of Buffalo 80b Conklin more‘
than lived up to his advanced billing as a
talented'baseball player in his tenure as an
Albany State Great Dane. ‘

the field. he at .\ ns willing to sacrifice ‘
himself for the te :1 A . rime example ofthis
would be that aftt. .joying two years of All-
SUNYAC fame at his third base position
Conklin was willing to move to the outfield
for the good of the team. All he found in
the outfield was more success as he was nam-
ed to the All-Conference learn for a third
straight season this season.

Conklin took his switch to the outfield in
stride as he cotntnented. "At the beginning I
was a little shaky in center but once i moved,
to left I got used to it."

The move really turned out to be a big plus
to the team as Conklin's replacement at third
base, Howie Hammond was named to the
honorable mention All-SUNYAC team.

ed the importance of having Conklin on the
team. "Bob has meant a lot to the program
at Albany since he got here." said the coach.
“Especially this year as he was one of only
three seniors. He was a pleasure to havelon
my team and to coach."

As was expected‘Conklin had a great year

 

 

 

swinging the bat. He was the team leader in
four offensive categories with three home
runs. 16 RBl's. 15 stolen bases and I9 runs
scored in just 65 at bats. Conklin was also se-
cond on the team with 20 hits, one triple and
a .307 batting average.

The freshman Hammond was the team
leader with 22 hits and a .400 batting average.
Hammond finished in second place with one
triple. t3 RBl’s and seven stolen bases.

Conklin has had many fine moments in his
stay at Albany. but. a few stick out in his
mind. Like the time he hit two home runs in
one day against Oheonta this past season or
the basesd loaded triple in the seventh inning
to secure an "-7 victory against Cortland.

Another one of Conklin’s finest moments
was during his sophomore year when Albany
was taking on Middlebury. Conklin got up to
the plate and sent a~rocket sailing way over
the fence. Conklin just stood at home plate '
admiring his shot ala Reggie Jackson. Going
through his mind at that time was. “i don't
believe i hit that ball." It was such hitting
prowess that earned Conklin the nickname
‘King Conk'lin. _

for four different managers. Of these he
thinks that current Dane skipper Zaioom is
the best. _

“Coach Zaioom gets a lot of respect from
all‘of his players."said Conklin. “He earns it
through his vast knowledge of the game.

“He has a very young and talented team
for next season Howie (Hammond). Fred
Saccocio and John Kakely are only
freshman. They all have very promising
careers ahead of them. V,

“As far as l'm concerned coach Zaioom
has only one fault. He is always listening to
Willie Nelson and country western music
isn't really my cup of tea.“ joked Conklin
about the fact that Zaioom spends much of
his free time relaxing and listening to Willie
Nelson tapes. .

Conklin believes that the Danes have a
very good shot at taking the SUNYAC title
next year. “They have a very good team
for next year. besides me every other starter is
returning," said Conklin.

Next year Conklin will attend Syracuse
University Law School and said that there
would be no problem for him to make it back
to see the Danes play.

Niskayuna came out on the short
end of an even 1-] score because of
I the last tiebreaker rule.

But in the eyes of D'eMeo, the
match wasn't close: “1 scored the
match 9-0 for Shawn. i thought the
referee called a couple of his throws
out of bounds that weren't."

So DeMeo wasn't too surprised
at Shcldon's shutout victory last
week: “i think it just took time to
get used to T.J.'s style," said
DeMeo. "Once he did. Shawn pro-
ved to be the stronger wrestler."

DeMeo is banking that Sheldon

seems. DeMeo wanted that match

for Sheldon, who had never wrestl-

moves and later we'll sort out the
ones that worked." said DeMeo.

One more match for Dane Ol

For two Albany State wrestlers. their five
year-old Olympic drcams have reached the
brink of reality. The cumbersome trail the
two ltave been required to endure in order to
gain a berth on the t984 U.S.A. Olympic
team has rcachcdits final pit stop— the Final
Olympic Trials.

Allendale. Dane All-American wrestlers An-
dy Seras and Shawn Sheldon will be putting
their Albany State purple and gold uniforms
away in the drawer. and will instead. fight for
the right to wear Uncle Sam's red. white. and
blue at the upcoming I984 Summer Games in
Los Angclcs.

Although tltc Trials. which are being held
on the campus of Grand Valley College.

Their strong placement on the proverbial

Sheldon is also positioned in a favorable

Albany’s basketball team
goes undefeated in France

By Keith Marder
spams Eolrwr

The Albany State men‘s basketball team
recently took their show overseas when they
went to France. Don‘t be surprised if they are
not invited back.

As a matter of fact. the Danes returned
home sporting an unblemished 4-0 record.
They also won the scrimmage they played in.

The first two wins did not come easily to
the Danes as they were only able to manage
narrow one-point victories. To win these
games Albany had to overcome the strong
Performances turned in by fellow American
Skeeter Jackson. who amassed over 80 points
in the two games. Jackson was eligible to play
on both the Charonton team and the Racing
Club of Paris squad because he is switching
from one to the other for next season.

“He was the best playcrl have ever played
against." said Dane point guard Dan
Croutier who played against the likes of An-
drc Hawkins from Syracuse and Notrc
Dame's Tim Kcmpton while playing for St.
Agnes High School.

Croutier hadan outstanding trip of his
own. The 5'7" Croutier was up to his usual
tricks as he had 48 points. 28 assists and
countless steals to show for his trip. His
quickness and court smarts won over the
French spectators.

“The crowds really liked him." said
Albany State Head Coach Dick Snucrs.
“They recognized his ability."

Great Dane player Greg Hart echoed his
coach's sentiments.“They thought he was
great. they really liked him.

Dave Adam. Crouticr's back court partner
told this- story that epitomized Croutier's
popularity. “The family i stayed with asked
me who was the best player on the team. and
l Pointed to Danny.”recailcd the Niskayuna
native.” They said. ‘him. but he is so short'.
l told. them“just watch the game.

“He really impressed them. he stoic the
ball front one guy four times in a row. He
would let thc guy dribble by him and "Him
steal the ball from bchind and then send it
down court for a fast—break basket."

That incident happened bcl'orc thc game
against Les Pallaidcs which Albany won han-
dily 100-87. To go along with his l0 steals,
Croutier also compiled six assists and i4
points.

Two other players who mudc their
presence felt were Hart and Rich Chapman.
“Greg played thc best of the big mcn,"said
Saucrs. "Rich has very good instincts aroun
the basket."

l'lnrt hclicvcs this trip will be a big factor in
thc Danc's success next season. “It is going
to be great for us."suid.l~iart. “i think it is
what wc needed to take the lcaguc next
year.”

Hurt shot 2l-36 over the four games . He
also pulled down a tczun high 24 rebounds.

Chapman pttllcd down l7 rebounds including ~

seven of which came in the Danc's final
game. a 93-75 drubbing of Club Dc Mttttrin.
Another player who played with renewed
confidence was llrian Kauppila. Kauppila
scored 29 points and had 10 assists to his
credit. -
Said Croutier, “i think it (the trip) will
help us next year. Grcg (Hart) and Brian
Knuppila definitely gained confidence.
Adam led the team in scoring with 62
points as he picked up right where he left off
the season as he shot a sizzling 28-47 in

France. John Mracek was second in scoring.

with 50 points just edging out Croutier and
Hart for those honors as they compiled 48
points. ii

awarded the match as he scord a 3 point
throw compared to Martincz's four one-
point escapes.

"it's a two horse race.“ said Albany State
coach Joe DeMeo. who also scrvcs as mentor
of the Adirondack Wtcstling Club. which
qualified eight other wrestlers to the Trials in
addition to Scras and Sheldon. “Tltcy'rc two
great wrestlers and botlt are capable of winn-
ing the gold. it just will dcpcnd ttpon who
has the better day." he added.

in this May's National (ircco-Roman
Championship held at Albany State. it was
Martinez. who had the better day. rocking
Scras 8-2.

“l-ic wrcstlcd (lousy)," said DcMco, using
a harshcr word titan lousy." He did a lot of
foolish things. We have it all on videotape

ym’pic hopefuls V

and he's seen it l2 times."

There was more to Seras’ collapse. He was
wrestling with stomach cramps caused by
overeating. To make weight. Seras had to
fast four days before the tournament and his
first meal after he got off the scale did not
agree with him. ~

Whether the reviewing of the videotapes
helped or not. Seras appeared to be a dif-
ferent wrestler in Minnesota.

“He‘s got to wrestle Martinez in a rougher
style than other wrestlers," analyzed DeMeo.
“Wrestling is a rough sport as it is. but Seras
has got to go beyond that to beat him. That’s
why he won in Minnesota."

Scras was unable to be reached at the train-
ing site in Michigan for comments. but his
coach of five years knows what his prodigy is
thinking.

"He's expecting to face Martinez; we all
are." said DeMeo. who was assistant coach
for thc l976_U.S.A. Olympic squad. “It's.
tough for him to be ‘very' confident when
you‘re going up against a guy that’s beaten
you twice in'four matches. He has a heck of
a lot of confidence in his ability as a wrestler
but hc respects Martinez as a great wrestler."

Shcldon's route to an Olympic starting
bcrth is a bit more extensive. He will first hit
the mats on Friday and his expected oppo-
ncnt is T.J. Jones. four-lime National Grcco-
Roman Champions lf Sheldon gets by him.
top-seeded Fuller is on deck.

But first things first. Jones represents a
formidable test for the Dane freshman. Last

it was Sheldon's.first triumph over the 27
year-old in three Irics. His two losses were
