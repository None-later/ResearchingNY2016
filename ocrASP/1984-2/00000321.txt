Students to run voterregistration-ta‘le    

""iStudent Action Committee'

By Robin Katz .

Steve Gawley thinks-he might
have a really original idea to get
students to sign-up to vote.

"We’re gonna outreach to the
off-campus students by doing the
registration at the bars." he ex-
plained. Gawley. who heads Cen~
tral Council's Student Action com-
mittee. added. “we're trying
something different. we're just gon—
na see how it goes."

Several owners of popular
SUNYA hangouts have already
agreed to set up tables in their hats.
Gawley said. explaining that on Fri-
day and Saturday nights next
weekend. students will be able to
register at the Lampost. W.T.'s.
Across the Street Pub. and the
Long Branch. .

Student Association at SUNYA.
the Student Association of the State
University (SASU) and the New
York Public interest Research
Group tNYPlRG) are all running
voter registration drives in support
of the 1984 elections.

Gawley said much of the credit
for the idea belongs to SASU’s

Pep rally,

By Michelle Busher
STAFF warren

More than 400 students may have
set SUNYA on the path to proving
Rolling Stone Magazine wrong.
when they attended a pep rally on
the podium last Friday night.

in their latest issue. Rolling Stone
Magazine published a list from Lisa
Birnbach’s College Book in which

SUNYA ‘was rated as one of two'

schoois'wiih the least school spirit
in the country.

But more than 400 students turn-
ed out for Friday night’s SA spon-
sored pep rally and Saturday's foot-
ball game drew a crowd of over
3.000.

SA Programming Director Patty
Salkin snid that the pep rally. in
honor of Saturday's football game
against lthaca. had been planned
before the Rolling Stone article was
published.

Salkin said she has no idea who
Birnbach spoke to. “With over 75
organizations requesting SA fun-
ding. and the crowds that we get at
Mayfest every year." Salkin said.
“i don‘t see how she can say that
we have the least school spirit."

“in the past, pep rallies run by
the athletics department have been
pretty unsuccessful.” explained
Salkin. .

Salkin was pleased with the large
turnout at Saturday's football game
against lthaca. “That was a great
psych up for the team." said
Salkin.

The team won its season opener
against lthaca 10-6.

“SA has a lot planned for this
year." reported Salkin. "We've

reached by regular activities such as
dorm sweeps. Gawley explained.
NYPlRG. meanwhile. is concen-
trating on community registration.
Efren Kann. a project coordinator
at SUNYA. said NYPIRG and SA

coordinator. called his organiza-
tion’s approach to voter 'rcgistra-
tion a three pronged approach.

“We are trying to facilitate any
voter registration ‘activity that
might be happening on any of these
campuses." he said.

According to Jaffe. the first cell,
to the campuses were made 'on
Tuesday. He mentioned colleges
3th F8 RBI, ,
Valley Community Coilege.- CSR
and Union as possible participants
in the drive.

' Community voter‘registration: is ' he

ding that volunteers will aim for the

blacks and hispanlcas as registra-
tion targets. v . t

. “Statistically those would be the
groups with the highest concentra-
tion of unregistered voters. We plan
to hit supermarkets. street fairs.
unemployment ofﬁces and social
service centers." he explained.

NYPIRG hopes to register 40.000
people statewide. Kann said.

SUNYA's chapter has a gosl_of-
3.000. which both Jaffe. and Kann .

are conﬁdent they can meet.

“We've registered over L700
people in what is essentially to
days...and we have about 23 days
left to register the others." said
Kann.

football game draw high spirited crowds

had three big successes already with
the Freshman picnic (which was
held September 5), the pep rally and
the football game." she added.

in comparing» the turnouts for
last year's and this annual
Freshman picnics. Salkin said. "We
only had 75 freshmen at last year's
picnic. This year there were over
800." r .  .- _ 

She added that this may have “a
little to do" with thefact that the
picnic was held at indian Lake this
year. as compared to at Mohawk
campus in the past.

“SA has changed its focus."
claimed SA Vice President Suzy
Auletta. “We're more people
oriented and we're really pushing
involvement." she 'added.

“(SA President) Rich Schaffer '

and i went to the first State Quad
Board meeting this year." said
Aulcita. “and we were shocked at
the numbers that showed up."

“Something is definitely work-
ing. i think part of the reason can
be attributed to the fact that there
are a lot of returning officers (in
SA)." explained Auletta, adding.
“no one really had to be oriented to
the job. so we can accomplish a lot
more."

One of the accomplishments
Salkin said that she is excited about
is a Student Spirit Committee.

Salkin said the group will be
made up of selected students. and
will be in charge of organizing ways
to “bring the Great Danes and the
paw print into the university."
Salkin said she believes that many
students don't even realize that the
Great Dane is the SUNYA mascotl.

Salkin also described Spirit
Week. which will be held October
9-12. .

During Spirit Week. Purple and
Gold. a student group. will sponsor
a competition between the class
years in the Ratskeller called Class
Wars. inter-quad council is current-
ly considering a similar activity call-

...ed Quad Wars, and SA is planning
to sponsor a Guiness Book of

World Records contest.

These events will lead up to the
homecoming weekend. for which
Salkin said she is trying to organize
a parade.

“it will be the first homecoming
parade in a long time. but a lot of
planning still has to be done." she
said.

Salkin said that all of these events

were in the works over the summer.
before Lisa Birnbach's College .
Book was made public.

She said she hopes students will
react to the book by supporting
future SA events like Cultural
Awareness Day. September 18.
Group Fair Day. September 25 and
Parents Weekend. October l3 and .
