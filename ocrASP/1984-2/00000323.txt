After 10 years of working from temporary
bases, SUNYA's Five Quad volunteer am-
bulance service has settled into a permanent
home in the Student Health Services
building.

They moved their bunks. chairs, desks, fil-
ing cabinets, and radio dispatching equip-
ment from their old office on Colonial Quad,
and at the beginning of September began
their 24-hour ambulance service from their
new base.

Five Quad now occupies three rooms in the
Health Service building. A nurses‘ lounge
and two administrative offices have been
converted into Five Quad's permanent base.

Last year, Five Quad operated its am-
bulances from Dciancey Hall on Colonial
Quad, keeping its two ambulances in the Col-
onial parking lot.

"We have needed a permanent base to
operate from for a very long time," said Five
Quad Director of Operations Beth Hermsen.

Hermsen pointed out that ever since Five
Quad started in 1973, it has never had a per-
manent base.

“Five Quad has operated from a lounge
suite in Colonial, (and) from the basement of
State Quad, among other locmions around
campus,"'Hermsen noted.

Associate Vice President for Student Ser-
vices Henry Kirschner explained, “The
number one reason for moving the‘base was

to protect the vehicles."

in the past, the ambulances have been ex-
posed to both vandalism and severe cold
weather. Kirschner Said. '

Five Quad President Ray Dowling said
that, “hopefully by spring. we will start con‘
struction on a two-bay garage that will be
located in the parking lot of the Health
building."

Dowling added that the funds to support
such an endeavor .”have not come in yet."
The ambulances are now kept in the Health
building's parking lot. Kirschner explained
that the vehicles must be in optimum condi-
tion because “in an emergency, every second
counts." ,

Five Quad operates twenty-four hours a
day, seven days a week during the school
year, and from 8 a.m. to 4 pm. weekdays
during the summer.

Between 80 and 100 students currently
staff the volunteer service and at least 7 peo-
ple are on duty at all times, Hermsen said.

in order to assist in the move to the Stu-
dent Health Service building, Five Quad
received donations from various campus
groups, Hermscn explained.

Last year, the University Auxilary Ser-
vice's Programming Fund donated $10,000
to help with construction costs of the new
base. Various other groups, including the
Alumni Association, Civil Service
Employees Association, United University

Five Quad members outside their new base

Professors. Class of 1982 Council, and alum-
ni from Five Quad itself are all being peti-
tioned for funds to construct the two-bay
garage.

in 1982. Associate Vice President for Stu-
dent Health Services Neil Brown, then Dean
for Student Affairs, headed a committee that
drew up the permanent base proposal. The

2: report said that not only would the new per-
', manent base enhance the ambulan:e service,

but it would also create a "sense of com-
J munity” at SUNYA.

in a recent interview, Brown said, “i am
pleased to see Five Quad ﬁnally has a perma-

 

 

' Between 80 and 100 students currently staff the volunteer service ’

nent base." -.

Brown gave the credit for the move to the
students in Five Quad. “They have done all
the work." said Brown. “They have been in
charge of all the fund-raising. I'm just glad
to do what I can to help."

Five Quad offers ambulance training as
well as free courses in CPR, First Aid and
Advanced First Aid.

Dowling said that Five Quad is still seeking
new students to volunteer their time. Five
Quad is not soley for pre-med students.
claimed Dowling, noting that not one Five
Quad senior from last year went on to
medical school. . "‘
