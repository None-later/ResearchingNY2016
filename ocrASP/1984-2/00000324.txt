Minority~students have often been promis-
ed a chance for Increased involvement in stu-
dent groups. This summer. they got It in
writing.

Contracts pledging specific measures to be
taken to increase minority student involve-
tnent wore signed by approximately IO major
SA groups during the second annual SA
Human Rights Awareness weekend held at
Dippikill this summer. .

Among the agreements made was a pledge
by SUNYA's radio station. WCDB. to play
there Latin American music during their
Third World Itour and to train a few more
Latin American D.J.‘s. University Concert
Board agreed to try to bring more Latin
American concert artists to the SUNYA
campus. '

The Albany Student Press pledged to add a
new minority affairs column and assign an
ASP reporter to cover minority issues and
events.

"We are making an effort to keep the ASP
open to all minorities,” explained ASP
Editor-in-Chief David L.L. Laskin. who at-

tended the workshops. -

All the groups attending the weekend
meeting agreed there is a need to improve
minority recruitment and communication
lines. according to SA's minority affairs
coordinator Eric Bowman.

The weekend workshops gave represen-
tatives of major SA funded groups. including
WCDB. UCB and Albany Men's Intramural
Association. the opportunity to learn and
understand the special needs of racial minori-
ty studentshfrom representatives of the Pan-

’Caribbean Association (PCA), Fuerza

Latina, and the Albany State University
Black Alliance (ASUBA).

Other minority groups. including the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance (GALA) and the
Feminist Alliance. were unable to send
representatives.

UAS decides Coke isn’t it; '

UAS General Manager E. Norbert Zahm
says he’s never taken the Pepsi Challenge.
but this summer he chose Pepsi-cola over
Coca-cola anyway. I

His decision. he says. was based on
economics, not taste. Zahm explained that
Pepsi-cola offered UAS a better deal than
Coca-cola did, so this summer UAS gave
Pepsi-cola a two-year contract as the ex-
clusive soft drink supplier for the SUNYA
campus.

All the Coca-cola machines have been
removed from the campus and replaced by 80
new Pepsi-cola machines, and all five quad
cafeterias now offer Pepsi-cola soft drinks

According to Zahm. UAS takes bids on

the campus soft drink contract every two
years.

petitive." explained Zahm. who estimated
that Cocavcola has held the SUNYA contract
for at least to years. .

ly more attractive than the bid Coca-cola
made for the new contract. but Pepsi-cola ac—
tually offered UAS a better deal than Coca-
cola had given UAS in the previous contract.

such an attractive bid, according‘to Steve
Fahey, Pepsi-cola's Vice President in charge
of food service. is that Pepsi-cola has begun
to provide their bottling companies with
more ﬁnancial backing to seek school con-‘
tracts nationwide. ’

stressed “an inter-cultural learning process,"
explained Bowman.

="We must movegfrom the ethnocentrism
stage," Bowman stressed. “where groups are
independent. to the awareness stage and then
to the stage where we respect other cultures."

.Bowman expressed a need for similar
workshops on the SUNYA campus
throughout the year. Jefferson. Bowman ad-
ded. would help set up human relation
specialists to work with the Resident
Assistants (RA's) as well as administrators.

Bowman also said he hopes to arrange a
weekend of workshops in October for Cen-
tral Council members to attend.

“The more minorities get acquainted with
other groups the more they will be involv-
ed," he said. He suggested that SA groups
put qualiﬁers on their ads specifiylng non-
discrimination against minorities.

President of Fuerza Latina Oscar Lozano
agreed with Bowman, stressing the impor-
tance of ' SA officials attending Latin
American functions. a

"They will encounter many willing
students." he said, adding that there is not
enough Latin student participation in SA.
Lozano. also sought the help from SA in get-
ting more Latin students elected to ofﬁcial
posts.

Lozano asserted that there is not enough
Latin American advertising in the ASP. He
added that the ASP should address Latin
students in articles on Latin America. [3
