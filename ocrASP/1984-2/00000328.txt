Theatre Scene: Aspects takes a look at the box office offerings of three
of the area’s finest theatres: Prodor’s, Capitol Repertory, and ESIPA, or
more colloquially "the Egg.” lnduded in, this season’s-dramatic produc-
tions are highlights such as Guys and [bl/s, and The Wndin‘the Wllows.

Local MISiC It's a great weekend for the freshman to introdutr
themselves to some of Albany's top dub bands, all conveniently i
gathered under one roof; RPl’s. Also, John Keenan (you know, the guy
that wrote that lame excuse for a .colunn this week) takes a look at the _
Dongos first album

     
     
    
   
   
 
  

 

  
  

Centerfold: William Kennedy's Albany was no doubt the biggest celebra-
tion the city has seen in quite a while, and M'chelle Krell found herself
(and her shifty, noaccount editor) right in the middle of it on Saturday,
when Big Bill spoke before a crowd of Wfiter’s Institute supporters. Will
she ever wash her right hand again? Read and see!

 
       
     
     
 

 
    
  
 
 
 

 

 
 

PAC Attack:The summer Shakespeare production at the PAC was so
good (extremely, seriously, androgenously good, in fact), that it’s been
revived for three more showings, with the same talented performers
who garnered raves (isn’t that a ridiculous word, raves, but I’m in a
hurry) from all four of the major area newspapers. Also, a look at what
else will be coming out of the PAC'this fall.

Perspectives: B rand new associate Aspect editors Joe Fusco and Mchelle
Krell share a page of ponderings and profundities, Joe remembering his
old school Washington and Lee (which Lisa Blrnbach pasted even worse
than she did us), and M‘chelle exploring what makes a poet tick.

Interview. Pretty bland prehead, huh? Oe J.K. (that boy must have a
Drongo fixation!) tracks the New Zea land foursome to the third floor of
288 Lark, where they exchange views on the record industry and the
fact that interviewers generally come off “a lot better when their voices
aren’t cracking. '

 

 

 

 

 

C’est Moi

There seems to be an unrecorded geometric equation somewhere
that probably runs something to the order of; whenever you least feel
like writing, you’ve got the most writing to do.

Hi. It’s me. Back good as new with a whole new staff. I

I wrote a whole column about the staff of Aspects when I was first
named editor, last semester.

I couldn’t think of anything else to write for the column.

One of my better issues, however, and after all'the physical distress
my body has withstood tonight, I’d apprecrate It If you d give It a look ,
see. It’s a little different from last semester, but It’s just as good.

I'm sorry if I’m babbling, but I’m really fried.

And this is only my first issue.

Heh-heh-heh. Warning signs.

    
 

Aspects is looking for a new music editor, and
we may be looking for you.‘ Stop by CC 329 to
find out. '
