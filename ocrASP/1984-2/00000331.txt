Washington and Lee University. Virginia

Next fall, for the first time in 235 years,
Washington and Lee University will begin
to educate young women.

Alongside young men.

For the first time.

Never before has this college’s brand of
political science, for example, benefitted
from the contributions of women in the
classroom.

Never before has its student govern-
ment had to deal with the concerns and
perspectives of another gender.

In the recent past, young men attending
this college learned and applied their
careers and values apart from a segment of
society that is increasingly making its mark
on and influencing the character of
medicine, law, teaching, government, and
commerce.

.Never before has Washington and Lee
University had women toiling in its labs,
running for its offices, exerting themselves
on its athletic fields, or contributing quali-
ty in its classrooms.

 

Until now.

mon one being that s/he is highly anti-
social. This is untrue. All poets have had
miserable childhoods which have caused
them to become observers rather than par-
ticipators. Having learned to laugh at
themselves and at others they have a
marvelously well-honed sense of humor,
stunning good-looks, and can even
become the life of the party when they are
on time.

All right. So they are funny, but “they
can’t dress.” There is an explanation for
this phenomenon; a poet’s mode of dress
reflects his/her housekeeping habits.
Aren't most people lazy about things like
that? There is something about the order
of disorder to revel at so why not take
great delight in emulating the feather
duster you never owned? This is not ad-
vocating blatant puke style dressing, it is
just defending the person who wears two
different colored socks. Hey, if it was a
native Larkster you’d probably call it
fashion now wouldn't you?

Starting to feel guilty? You should. Most
poets are shy when they aren‘t cultivating
the alphabet although they secretly harbor
large egos when it comes to who they are
and what they do. Despite this, poets still
rate highly on the insecurity scale. Sure_
they only watch cartoons and public televi-
sion, but they are notoriously wonderful
consumers of wine. If you are ever invited
to a poetry reading, go! Even if the poetry
stinks you‘ll usually wind up intravenous-
ed to a bottle of chablis. _

At some readings you may find the
poetry so entrancing that you stop caring
about Ernest and Julio Gallo and start feel-
ing the words that you are hearing. This is
not a rare moment in readings. There are
usually one or two poets who revive your
inspirational rigor mortis and cause you to
stumble home drunk with emotion, so
much so that your friends will swear that
you are on something other than alcohol.

Does the word poetry now get a rise out

,wa—e

 

It was a battle; an obsession with faculty,
alumni, students. and administration. All
sides lined up and hurled well aimed
arguements at each other.

The facultytand some studentsiharped
on improving the quality of the college
and educating for “the real world".

The administration tossed figures on
declining applicant pools, its "current
share of the market", and improving the
quality of the college.

Most students, a sizeable number of
whom I believe would look rather dapper
debating the issue clad in medieval attire,
unfurled banners from fraternity houses.
"Better Dead than Coed" they trumpeted.
They laughed.

i frowned.

A student, whose major is Not Sure,
lamented to me, "Washington and Lee
will, with the arrival of women, no longer
be the same." He frowned.

I smiled.

And they battled.

They battled about tradition and prac-
ticality. They battled about prominence
and obscurity. They battled about yester-

‘ day, today, and tomorrow.

It would be easy to continue by criticiz-
ing their tradition, their prejudices and
their beliefs. instead, if you've never really
thought about it, consider what we ex-
perience through the course of our educa-
tion at the University at Albany. For many
of us, it might be rather surprising to learn
that a college like Washington and Lee
'University exists in our corner of the twen-
tieth century and the contrast won’t come
easy. ‘it isthere. "

The graces of enlightened thought for-
tunately have been arranged in our era
such that our society believes it has, and
benefits from, an obligation to offer the
opportunity of an education to all its
citizens regardless of creed, regardless of
color, regardless of race.

And regardless of gender.

The happy result is that all of us, in our
diversity of diversities, learn with each
other as we will deal with each other in
"the real world”.

We live with each other as we will live
with each other in "the real world".

,We share. We react. We disagree. We
experience.

Together.

We will prepare ourselves for this world,
together. by recognizing what our world
has become, hopefully without the
vestiges of any perceived relationship bet-
ween gendertor any other physical
characteristic, for that matter)an(l
excellence.

So let Us offer Washington and Lee
University, and places like it, a tentative
and encouraging welcome to the twen-
tieth century.

And to you I say "Welcome back to
school."

Welcome to the real world.
