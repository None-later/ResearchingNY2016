he Dion b5, (comprised of
" _ lean'McA ister on uitar and,

o'sv-z Headed

 

ke boards. Stan Michell on

drums, ichard Kennedy on guitar
and Ton McMaster on bass); 3
popular lbany club band, were in

town [this week to lay at the
notorious 288 Lark. Be are the, r-
formance, they found time to tal to
me about their recent, self-titled
album, and their plans for the future.
I met with them up on the third floor
of 288, and after an initial bout of
some . very unprofessional ner-
vousness (mine, not thiers), | manag-
ed to get them to give me their views
on the bands past and possible
future.

(The Drongos first album, released in
July, is reviewed elsewhere in this
issue.)

John Keenan

 

How long has the band been playing
together!

Stan Mitchell -We’ve been playing
together around five and a half years.
We got together in New Zealand and we
were there about a month. And then we
decided, adventure, we feel like adven-
ture. We'd all sort of arrived at a stage

is here we knew what New Zealand had
to offer in terms of a music scene. It’s
pretty at tive over there, some fine play-
ing and good scenes, but we wanted to
spread our wings a hit, so we came over
to the States. We were in San Francisco
for a little while under another name
and a different repertoire, and really, the
Drongos happened when we hit New
York City. Living in a hotel room on 49th
St., the first thing that came to our
minds was "How the hell are we going
to live?" So we hit the streets, this is a
story which possibly Albanians have
heard quite a bit, actually, so the
Drongos were born pretty much on the
corner of 50th and Broadway.

We played straightforward rock n' roll
and built up a good following on the
streets, and made a bit of money,
bought some equipment, and then we
hit the clubs. And we‘ve been working
out of New York City ever since.

I heard you went back to the street for
your next album?”

lean McAllister -We’ve always played
the streets, we never stopped.

Stan-Yes, it’s fun and it pops the band
up. There’s a strong chance that we're
gonna be on the road far more, and our
street performing become less and less,
so we took the time and took advantage
of the summer, and we recorded a street

set. Hopefully, it’s going to come out on
an LP real soon. It‘ll be our second LP
and should be out in November.

lean -liut it only took two days to
record it.

Stan -Wr- went out with a remote and
did our favorite haunts on the street,
and it should sound good.

This band has been up and around
Albany a lot, and you've built up quite a
following here. But recently, a lot of the
best clubs in Albany, The Chateau and
/.B. Scott's to name just two, have been
closed — 1.8. Scott’s was burned out. In
fact, the club condition here has been
described as "stabilized at bad.” Has
that affected you at all?

Stan -Well, I'll tell you, where we come
from we’re very used to that. We're all
from towns very similar to Albany, and
those towns do get affected by the
winds of change as far as clubs and that
go. By the way, they’re into burning
down clubs in New Zealand, also.

Richard Kennedy — (grinning) We don't
want to imply that LB. Scott's was burn-
ed down, deliberately.

Stan -The disadvantage is for the peo-
ple who live here, certainly. I mean, we
can come back and play the colleges,
like RPI this Saturday, and we can play
288 Lark, which is a stable scene. It’s the

eople who live here who’re the ones

 

 

 

Richard -Yeah, it's a shame, but these
things go in waves and I‘m sure that in a
year’s time the situation will be
different.

Your Iirst record was released on the
Proteus label. I’roteus, as far as i know,
is a rock hook company. They don’t
usually put out retords. Are they going
to be handling your records from now
on, or was it more of a one-shot deal?
Stan -|t’s an independant deal. We just
get the kind of treatment from that label
that we would never get from a major
record company. We would be one
name in a ledger hook in a major corn-
pany, but with this company, it’s. . .well,
our first record was their first record,
so

 

Richard -. . .we got the consideration

and understanding you wouldn't get

from a major label.

Are they going to do your second

record, also!

Stan -Oh, yes. I mean, how many ma-

jor record companies would send a

band out on the street with a remote
8-Irack and little battery operated

amplifiers and say .‘Alright, let's get this
down on tape and make an album.

None.

Most of the songwriting credits on the
first album were credited to Stan, with a
lot of collaboration. Do you do all of the
songwriting. or. . .

Stan -I used to do music and lyrics, 3
lot of it. I still take care of the bulk ofthe
lyrics and melodies and such, but more
and more it's happening from the band.
We throw some lyrics to it and take it to
rehearsal, and we'll all chip in, and ar-
range it. Richard comes up with a lot of
guitar riffs, which are pretty distinctive
of the sound.

. What do you guys like best about the
new album?

lean -lt got out! And it’s bright. And
the songs do come across.

Richard -The worst accusation that I
could level at a rock n’ roll band is that
they get pompous. Y'know,, like. . .(he
harumphs and looks at me with disdain
before breaking into a grin) That's whatl
like best about it, it's not a pompous
record.

Was it that hard to get out, then?

lean ~Ygah, it was a fairly long, and
pretty painful, process. I think first
records often are. It wasn‘t easy, and it's
only recently that I've been able, per-
sonally, to put it on and actually listen to
it as a record. Try to get some objectivity
and a bit of distance on it. And it
sounds. .'.good. I mean, I know why
we've gotten good reviews.

Stan -The thing I like best about it is
that we've got the energy in it. At the
time, that came across like anxiety, and I
know we thought it felt nervous and up-
tight, because that’s exactly how we felt
at the time. It was a pretty tough one to
get It out there. But what we hear after-
wards, and what a lot of reviewers seem
to hear in it, is that it's vital and

don’t want to sound like it’s all work,
and you sort of grinded it out. At least
it's got something that's over the top to
it. And hopefully, we can still retain that;
just have a better time with it next time.

The record has been getting a lot of
airplay on the alternative-college radio
stations up here in Albany. Do you hope
to someday branch out to the more
mainstream stations!

lean -Sure.

Stan -Yeah, it would be nice, but we
wouldn't want to compromise ourselves
to the point where we’re not happy play-
ing what we're playing. This is what's on
our mind, because we think about it a
lot. The American mainstream radio is a
tough nut to crack. You hear all sorts of
rumours like heavy graft involved, and
that you can’t get a foot in unless you‘ve
got big company backing, corporate
backing. You can’t even tour without
Coca-cola behind you, or something
else. It's a tough row to hoe. But we
want our music to appeal, so hopefully
we'll come out with a sound which is
pleasing to us and pleasing to the
mainstream, as well. Although I can't
hear us sounding like most of what I
hear on mainstream radio at the
moment.

Is the record getting as much airplay
down in New York as it is up here?

lean -More and more. Some of the big
commercial stations haven’t yet
discovered the Drongos', but some of
the alternative stations, WBAI, and some
of the college radio stations down there
have got the record, and they‘re playing

It.

Richard —College radio is the one,
anyway.

Yeah, college radio gets everybody
started, basically. How do the audiences
here in Albany compare to the ones in
New York?

lean -They're great. The last time we
played in Albany we played here (288
Lark), and they were just over the top.
Stan -|t’s funny, both lean and Richard
come from the capital city of New
Zealand, and, (gestures to Richard) you
were saying, right? You get a similar vibe
in a capital seat. ..

Richard -In a town this size, as well.
There are, well, party circuits, also.

Stan -People are interested.

Richard -There's not too much pom-
pousity, you know?

Now that your ﬁrst record is out, with
one due in November, what are your
plans?

lean -We’ve got a lot of gigs coming
up, actually. We’ve got, um, we’re going
to be travelling a lot, playing a lot, in the
next couple of months, and the hopeful-
ly, by maybe the end of November, we'll
get back into the studio again and do
our third record. (Crins.)That's the plan.

50 that’ll be three records in six mon-
ths, right?

Stan -The street album Is like another
project again, we banged it out in two
days, and we’ll bang It out in short order

 

energetic, and it punches right out

 

who are missing out In the long run.

there. To me, that's the best thing. You

The Drongos in I982

something we’ve been preparing for
sort of along the way, in the background
of all that.
Richard -The street album is more of a
novelty album, actually. It's an historical
record of songs which got us through
the early days, which are too good to
lose, but we don’t see them being a part
of the direction that we’re heading. But
it’ll be good to have them immortalized,
and have people understand where
we're coming from. Because they have
been important to our roots as a hand.
You know how big MTV has become,
and how a lot of the “purist“performers
like Elvis Costello and [00 lackson have
come out and said they hated it, it’s hor-
rible. What do the Drongos think of
MTV?

lean -It is pretty horrible, actually. I
tend to agree with them both, that what
'it could be, and what it is, are two dif-
ferent things. I mean, it could be
amazingl

ductions. They remind me of jeans
commercials.

Tony McMaster -But it's a great tool for
breaking new bands. Elvis Costello and
Joe Jackson don’t really need it. People
like ourselves. . .a good MTV clip, with
the right production and everything,
could make us famous. A million-seller.

lean -The whole politics of MTV,
though, is pretty twisted. They've
recently signed deals with the four big-
gest record companies for a thirty day
exclusive on their artists videos.

Stan -loe Jackson’s got a good perspec-
tive on it. He said some bands, like
Duran Duran for instance, they're made
for MTV, and it’s great for them to do it.
But other bands, it's making poor actors
out of good musicians. But I guess that
as far as a band like us is concerned,
we’ve got to consider it a challenge to
make a good video, something that’s go—
ing to work for us. That's the challenge
for any band. But. . .what you aspire to,
and what you are allowed to do, and
what you have finances to do, are dif-
ferent stories. MTV's probably gonna
end up in a commercial straitjacket,
same as commercial radio.

lean ~That’s the problem with it at the
moment. It's also become extremely
formularized.

Richard -I have a problem with videos,
apart from the few "classics" that you
can count on the fingers of a few hands,
and that is that every piece of music I've
ever listened to, I attach a sort of an im-
age to, my own little image, and when I
see a video it just sort of erases all the
tapes. So I don't watch MTV.

lean -Another thing is that most of the
artists that you see on MTV don't know
very much about videos, they don't
know very much about how to make
and produce one. They are mainly
songwriters and musicians; and it’s so-
meone else’s vision that usually prevails
when you make a video. . .usually the

record company that puts up -the
