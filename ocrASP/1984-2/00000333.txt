money, hires a director, and what the

director says goes, so it's not necessarily

a true reflection of the song. I think

Richard's point is very valid there, when
I you consider that.

So you ’d say videos bind an artist’s
creativity, and lock them into being
more photogenic. . .

Jean -Some bands that's fine for,
because that’s the look they are going
(or, the look, the image, and they’re
gearing themselves up to look good on
video and to present videos as their ar-
tistic expression, but most bands aren‘t
like that.

Stan -That forces you to deal with
another medium, which some bands
might not necessarily want to deal with.
They’re musicians. They're' not
fllmakers. Or actors. But they're forced
to become that. And then it‘s totally in
the hands of the producer to do justice
to them. But the best thing about it Is, is
that already there’s been a lot of alter-

 

 

Drongos talk of their
past and future

native programming. Even on network
television, which is very entertaining at
it’s best. Unfortunately, they don't have
exclusive rights to new videos, you geta
lot of old stuff, but hopefully it's going
to be wide open, and the competition is
going to make it a lot more open to
creativity and a lot more experimenta-
tion, and less of a commercial straight-
iacket. I mean, MTV can't rule the roost
forever. .

Is there a video in the Drongos future?

Jean -Yes, there is, but we haven’t sat
down and planned it out yet. For one
thing, it's very expensive to make a
video.

Stan -And it’s got to be coordinated
with everything too, the release of the
right LP at the right time, the right song;
it'd be terrible to make one before we’re
ready, Just because we have to, with a
producer who is not sympathetic to the
mu 5 t c . '

the Editor: _

pirit is alive and well on the SUNYA campus. Last week.
events proved this: the Fresh Picnic and the Great Danes
. Rally. Both activities were a huge success, thanks to the
rt: of miny people. .

aurle Midgette and Cheryl Pemberton. the co-chairs of
picnic, did a great job coordinating the day's events. The
r Orientation Assistants, especially Jayne Rand, played a
or role in encouraging students to attend. Also, thanks to
rlenc Bryan, WCDB, Jackie Bernstein. Ross Abelow,
dy Doorley, and Donna Shcehan. Without all of these
pie pitching in, we could not have done such a thorough

as! Friday night. the small fountain area on the podium
ﬁlled with students,‘ faculty and administrators display-
their purple and gold attire and holding “Go Danes"
oons. The Pep Rally added that extra'bit of support and
ouragemcnt to help the Danes to victory over Ithaca on
urday. Thanks to Ivan Shore. Andrea Snyder, and Risa
nenshine for assuming a common disguise. Special
ks to the members of Purple and Gold who helped to
oratc the Rat and give away hundreds of helium balloons.
DB played'a large part, before and during the rally (extra
ial thanks to Jonathan Cosin, who even on his birthday
. d to make the rally a good time for all). Also thanks to
Albany State Pep Band. the Cheerleaders, the Class of
, and Eric Schwartzman. The program ran smoothly with
help of emcces Tom Whitcly, Bob Mason and Bill
han.

Moat of all. a round of applause goes to all the spirited
people who attended these events and all of those behind the
scenes whose names are too numerous to mention. This is
Just the beginning of the year. We're off to a great start and
there's no stopping the spirit and fun to follow. Together we
will continue to make it happen.

Please help out

To the Editor:

Over the past years this campus has been plagued by
apathy — this is the year it must come to an end. A new pro-
gram is being formally cstablishcd on campus this year. This
program needs 100 to 200 friendly. outgoing. open-minded
students. The program is great for the campus, for you as in-
dividuals and it's great for your resumesl What is this pro-
gram that will only takc up approximately 2 hours of your
time a week and enable you to meet hundreds of people] It is
the DON‘T WALK ALONE ESCORT SERVICE. Don't
Walk Alone, (DWA), is an escort service comprised of all
student volunteers that walk students around the campus at
night. The escorts are dispatched from various areas in teams
of two (one male. one female). This program has received
much attention around the state. For DWA to work it needs
your help. Please stop by the Don't Walk Alone office (it's
in the basement of the Campus Center. by the bookstore)
and sign up today! And remember. this university is what
you make it.

Bus fee casualty

To the Editor:

This morning on the bus I was reading a pink two-page let-
ter pasted above the driver's head. It said the university is
trying to save some money by charging certain students for
the priviledge of riding the buses. I'm all for saving money.
It‘s what I do most, because I have to pay for my education.

" u‘I-u.

 

That's why I didn't complain in the Rat when [couldn't no
the food I was about to eat, much lean thawomaa who was
sitting acorn the table. I ﬁgured they had the lights dimmed
to save money.

g Besides. it's perfectly easy to do some quick braiic 'work
on the food. and to shout above the music to ascertain the
identity of one't dinner companion. H

After I ﬁnished dinner and groped my way out‘of the Rat.
I walked to the bus stop. OOPS'll No more tickets. Ah well.
no problem. I'll just go to the little booth and buy some
more. What'7lt's closed? Oh, this university ll so concien-
tious. They've probably closed the booth: to rive even more
money. Now that idea I can really go along with. And
they're probably even selling tickets after hours at the Infor-
mation Desk. Those wise men over in the administration
building deserve every penny they earn. figuring out these
great schemes for saving money and all. Well, guess what
folks] They don't sell tickets after hours at the information
desk or anywhere else. Now I can help save myself and the

university more money than ever. Instead of using the bus, I
can walk.

On second thought, maybe I’ll go down to the Cafeteria

and think up a title for my new book. Ah hal CatCIl 22..

Wasted dollars

To the Editor:

I am writing this letter to express my anger and frustration
with our campus administrators. in my walks around the
campus in the past several months I have noticed ornamental
trees springing up along Indian. State and Colonial Quads as
well as the several dozen Beech trees that have appeared
along the length of the podium. As an artist I can sympathize
with wanting an attractive campus. but in these times of
economic difficulties, shouldn‘t our money be used for items
of a higher priority? What right does this university have to
increase our tuition. charge us for the use of the SUNY
buses, and then go and shamelessly waste thousands of our
dollars on items as unimportant as trees] This also forces me
to ask: What else is our money being wasted on)

We as students should not take this lightly. I suggest that
we all refuse to buy our bus passes which will force our ad-
ministrators to realize that we will not be exploited)
