dominated the market in high schools and
colleges." Fahey said, noting that. “Pepsi-
cola has become more competitive than
they've ever been before.”

Zahm pointed out that a company mAy
seek a school contract in the hope that
students will become habitual consumers of
that .mnpnny‘s products.

"If lney can establish you (students) as
Pepsi drinkers or Budweiser drinkers...
They're obviously hoping that‘you'll be long-
tcrm customers." Zahm explained. adding,
“companies attempt to establish a younger
aged marketing base."

Fahey. however, said Pepsi-cola is only in-
terested in offering students what "we (Pep-
si) feel is the best product available."

In the 1983-84 ﬁscal year. Zahm said. UAS
“just about broke even." on the sale of soda
on campus. Since UAS can't raise the price a
few cents at a time (because vending
machines don’t take pennies), they expect to
sustain a small loss on soda sales this year
and. Zahm said, they will consider raising the
price by ﬁve'cents next fall.

SUNYA students drink a lot of soda, ac-
cording to Zahm, who said that l.3 million
cans of soda were purchased on the SUNYA

, campus last year. There were 946.000 cans of

soda bought between last September and
May, and 407,000 were returned to UAS for
5 cent redemption.

Zahm further noted that UAS is still ex-
ploring possibilities for new beverages to be
sold in the dorms, including a full line of
juices.

Responses to the switch from Coca-cola to
Pepsi-cola have been “generally favorable.”
Zahm said, adding. “i suspect we probably
have some conﬁrmed Coke drinkers who are
unhappy with the change." [I]
