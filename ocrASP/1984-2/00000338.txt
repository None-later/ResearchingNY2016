day's performance is any indication of the
pgnu' potential. Albany runnerstook ten
out of the first eleven spots as sophomore
Tom Hoff. junior Ian Clements, and senior

Cobleskill on points. Junior Chuck Bro‘nner
came in fourth as he kicked by Cobleskill's

who ﬁnished farther back because of a

the Danes' top ten to complete the traveling

squad that will take on Division ll East
Stroudsburg and Division I powers Army
and host Syracuse this afternoon at 4:00 pm.

Head Coach Bob Munsoy is counting his
blessings on his ﬁngers and toes these days.

Munseyplens to mlxup the personnelon
his competition squad and avoid naminga
set team. for some time ."There’s two
reasons-footie“. First, I’ve got too much
talent to ram-millet“. these seven guys are

We improve. you never know what's go- v

toughest. most gruelling schedule since l9”.
lfl ran the same guys every meet. they'd be
flat inside of three weeks. We've got enough
horses to run a couple of fresh ones every
meet."

It seems that this new found depth of
talent is'the main feature that distinguishes
this year's team from the l983 squad. The
Danes' thirty member roster is the largest in a
decade and includes only five seniors. This
continued increase of manpower and talent
reﬂects a trend in Albany's cross country
program. Senior Ed McGill commented.
“Going to Nationals doesn’t hurt the team’s
reputation. and success breeds success, and
success makes Coach Munscy happy."
