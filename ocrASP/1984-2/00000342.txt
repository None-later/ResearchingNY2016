Directories expected .to arrive in

November;Ch-esin see If y

'By Leslie Chalt

After the series of unfortunate
events last year which delayed the
release of the I983-B4 Campus
Directories until March, ad-
ministration ofﬁcials have an-
nounced that a new ﬁrm will be
printing this year's directories,
and that they should be out
sometime in November.

Addresses and phone numbers
of students living on the quads are
not yet available at the campus
center information desk. As soon
as students’ on—campus housing
has been ﬁnalized later this
month, the Ofﬁce of Residential
Life will provide the information
desk with a listing of students’
phone numbers and addresses, ac-
cording to Campus Center direc-
tor Don Bielecki. Until then,
students needing friends’ phone
numbers on the quads should call
the quad ofﬁces.

The phone numbers are: Alum-
ni 455-6264; Colonial 457-8601;
Dutch 457-7900; Indian 457-3989;
and State 457-888].

Associate Vice President for
University Affairs Sorrel Chesin
said that, for the firSt time. one of
the firms that prints other campus
related information, such as
University Catelogues and
Bulletins, has the directories as
well.

The directories will be com-
pleted faster this year than last,
said director of university
publications Jonathan Hyde,
because C.H.'Orose and Sons of
Ballston Spa. the ﬁrm which is

printing the directories, will not "

The entire procedure of

Last year’s directories were

Hispanic roots honored in‘ week

By Ilene Welneteln
31m wan-as

To help prevent unique elements of their
culture from disappearing into the
American melting pot, Hispanics in
Albany are currently celebrating their
roots, during “Hispanic Heritage Week."

The free, week-long festivities began
Sundpy with Hispanic Day ceremonies at
the Plaza and will end Saturday with a
“family fun day" featuring children’s
events, ethnic foods and a dominoes tour-
nament at Capitol Park, explained
Milagros Baez O'Toole, co-chair of the
Heritage Week Committee.

For art enthusiasts, the New York State
Museum features a week-long spotlight ex-
hibition of three prominent artists:
Angeles Ba!lestat‘-Bosch, a local resident,
as well as Felix Cordero and Richard Tor-

. res, both from New York City.

The Hispanic film world is featured by a
special showing of the award-winning
“Los Dos Mundos di Angelita” (“The
Two Worlds of Angelita”). The ﬁlm, in
Spanish with English subtitles. recounts
the story of a nine-year-old Latin
American confronted with life in the
United States. The movie will be shown
Wednesday 8 pm. at the Egg.

Hispanic music and musicians will play
an integral role in the festivities. Musica
Hispana, a noted New York City ensem-
ble, will perfo: m chamber music Thursday
