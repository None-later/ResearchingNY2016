would just have to go In with a
few minor modifications,“ such
as replacing the lighting and

He said he is confident that
construction of another facility
will begin in the near future.
“We’re not talking about five
years form now. I would expect
us to do something this semester

said, concluding, “At the other
user rooms you feel like you’re
surrounded only by business ma-
