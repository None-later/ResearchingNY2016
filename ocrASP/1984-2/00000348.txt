"solution, services. facilities and
. urces of the student health service."

The presence of a health clinic on cam-

us provides not only an “economy of
me," but also a financial savings for
tudents. because the inﬁrmary charges
ess for prescription medications and
iergy shots, according to Brown.

Haffner estimated the cost of an over-

ight stay at an inﬁrmary at $45 to $50.

he price for a comparable visit to a

ospital would be $300 to 3400, he said.

Services provided by health clinics are
“more cost effective to students but not to
he (New York) state." responded Pam
rzeshowski. spokesperson for Com-
ptroller Regan.

Haffner expressed fears that “with
budget cuts we’ll end up with no infir-
maries," adding. “You don’t teach young
people to maintain health by withdrawing
services."

“we've cut our staff quite a bit over ten
years. It’s been an almost 50 percent
reduction." lamented Brown. In response
to these cuts. the infirmary has had to
become more efﬁcient, he maintained.

“I’d strongly resist any (further) cut-
backs." Brown asserted. “l'd like to build
back in a modest way.” he added. A der-
matology clinic and a weight reduction
program are future goals for SUNYA's in-

‘ firmary said Brown.

Of the 30 State-operated colleges, 26
have health clinics. The total operating
cost of campus infirmaries was $6.2
million for the fiscal year ending March
31,1983. according to Regan’s office. Of
the total cost, 96 percent was funded by
the state, the report stated, with the re-
maining funds being drawn from student

ees.
The report also criticized SUNY for fail-

ing to establish a policy for phylidau who
are "on call."

According to Brown. hill-time medical;
personnel at the SUNYA Infirmary work'
in the inﬁrmary building at least 25 hours f
per week. The rest of the time they spend

“on call" at home. he explained.

For every three hours of on call duty1

they are paid the equivalent of one hours
work. continued Brown. This is the pro-
cedure used by hospitals throughout the
nation. he noted.

The auditors said that it appeared
“unclear whether health clinic physicians
can be paid for" on call hours.

“You can’t expect professional people
to be on call and not be paid," Haffner
explained.

The report said that the decision concer-
ning on call hours should be made by
SUNY and other state agencies, and if
those organizations felt that on-cail pay
was appropriate they should draw up a
policy for recording work performed by
physicians when they are not at the health
clinic.

The Comptroller’s Ofﬁce also recom-
mended that the “basic student health ser-
vices" to be funded with State money
should be deﬁned by SUNY.AII other
“health services should be funded through
direct charges to students," stated the
report.

Orzeshowski explained that all state
agencies are periodically audited. The
report, she noted, is “advisory in nature"
and is not legally binding.

The head of the agency, however, must
report to the Governor. The Comptroller
and legislative leaders within 90 days after
the release of the report to say whether
recommendations have been implemented
or why they have not been according to the
State Executive Law. El

Cohen and Singer collaborate

<Front Page

Cohen said she has never allowed herself
to partake in what she considers“the in-
dulgence” of creative writing.
“Although” she added. “now that we
have the Writer’s Institute it makes it
respectable to do creative writing.” She
said that she secretly wanted to be an ac—
tress, and is able to live out her wish in
classes, which “are captiveaudicnccs."
But, she said. her greatest love is teaching.

Cohen won the 1984 Excellence in
Teaching Award at SUNYA.

Cohen Said she often writes about
serious issues, but with a humorous touch.

“Jewish humor, as we know it. began in
the Mid-nineteenth century from the Yid-
dish Tradition." she said, citing the Jewish
Proverb “Leid macht auch Lachen," (Sor-
rows also make for laughter), to explain
the development of this sense of comedy.

“There were many sorrows, poverty and
powerlessness, among the Eastern Euro-
pean Jews and Their descendants, who
have gone on..." lo become actors and

comedians, she said.

Singer was born in Poland, spending
most of his childhood in Warsaw, and
coming to America in 1935. He writes in
Yiddish. which, according to Cohen, he
considers a language very much alive, and
he often translates his own work to
English. Along with winning the I978
Nobel Prize for “narrative art with roots
in Eastern European Yiddish cultural
tradition,” Singer has been awarded 15
Honorary Doctorates, including the
SUNY Honorary Doctorate in 1981. for
which Cohen nominated him, and he was
made an Honorary General of the US.
Army.

Three of Singer‘s plays will open this
season in three different
languagestEnglish. Yiddish, and Hebrew.
Play of the Devil will be performed at the
Folksbiene Theatre in New York and
Teibele and Her Demon will be playing in
Israel.

Singer is in Switzwcland now, but will
return to New York in time for the opening
of Shlemiel the First, Cohen said. Cl
