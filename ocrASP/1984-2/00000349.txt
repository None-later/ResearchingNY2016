SEPTEMBER 22

 

 

Reagan cute hlt colleges hard

<7 .

Title lX prohibits federally-funded col.
leges from discriminating on the basis of
gender.

Prei'ious administrations forcefully re-.
'quired schools that received any form of

federal funding to sign a statement verify-
ing that no school programs discriminated
on the basis of gender.

Reagan changed the policy, supporting
court cases that made only those campus
programs which directly got federal money
swear they didn't'discriminate.

The administration also proposed to
begin granting tax exemptions to schools
that discriminate on the basis of race.

The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ap-
proved Reagan's Title lX position, but
upheld the Internal Revenue Service’s right
to deny tax exemptions to discriminatory
schools.

At the, same time, the administration
supported efforts to take away faculty tax
exemptions on job beneﬁts like tuition
breaks for their families and campus hous-
ing, noted iris Molotsky of the American
Association of University Professors
(AAUP).

Students, USSA’s Ozer adds, have had
“very little input” in federal policies since
Reagan took office.

“Reagan’s approach to education has
been more on issues of prayer in school or
discipline than on substantive issues like
access, quality, and funding," Molotsky
said.

Administrators, too. complain the presi-
dent has' done little good for higher educa-
tion in the last four years.

“We had hopes that the administration,
given its rhetoric, would have been more
responsive in making regulations less
burdensome,” said American Council on
Education spokesman Larry Zaglaniczny.

“Instead there’s a lot more,” he said,
because of new requirements for students
to prove they’ve registered for the draft,
income statements, and needs tests that

must now be ﬁled with ﬁnancial aid forms.

Other higher education officials are
more neutral in their assessment of
Reagan’s performace. - '

“We’ve simply been too overwhelmed
with state funding cuts and imposition:
that we really haven't noticed many .of the
effects from Reagan.” said Art Martinez.
president of Orange Coast Community
College in California.

Federal aid cuts. for instance. "haven't
really affected us because up until this year
fees and tuition were free for state
residents." he explained. [J

Women's Safety

<Front Page

There will also be a panel discussion
dealing with “date rape”, or violence in
heterosexual relationships. This will be
held at noon on Thursday in CC 370. '

SUNYA Director of Afﬁrmative Action
Gloria DeSole will lead a discussion onr
“Sexual Harassment in the Academic En-l
vironment" which she described as “un-
wanted advances made by a person in
power to a person in relatively less
power.” She added that this may also oc-
cur from student to student.

DeSole will highlight her discussion with
a ﬁlm entitled Workplace Hustle. Accor-
ding to DeSole, the film “illuminates the
difference between women's and men's
attitudes.”

Post. who has helped coordinate
previous Women’s Safety Awareness
Days, said she believes this is one of the
most important and successful programs
on campus.

To wrap up the Awareness Days, there
will be a discussion on “Violence Against
Women” headed by former members of
Albany Women Against Rape and. to con-
clude. a wine and cheese reception in the
