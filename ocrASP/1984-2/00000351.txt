An interest meeting is scheduled for
Thursday, September 20 at 7:30 pm. in
the rear lobby _(nearest to the football
field) of the Physical Education
Building to explore the possibility of
forming an intercollegiate crew pro-
gram at Albany. The sport would be
open to both men and women.

Rowing programs, are gaining
popularity in many parts of the country
and especially in the Best. A number of
nearby institutions. including Union,
Skidmore and Hamilton have new crew
programs and Albany, with the
assistance of private funding, is well
situated to add a similar program. A
coach for the team is expected to be ap-
pointed shortly and a practice- .
preparation scheduled is aimed at put-
ting the crew in competition by Spring,
1985.

Basketball physical
V According to Dane's basketball

coach Dick Sauers, a physical is to be
required for all students who are trying

‘ out for the junior varsity basketball

team. The tryouts are on October lath.

WOULD YOU LI

FUN, EASY, EDUCATIONAL JOB
THAT WON’T INTERFERE WITH SCHOOL?

 

By Perry Tlschler
mnwsrm

Can a new coach, with a new strategy.
take a new team and turn it into a new
powerhouse? The drama unfolds as the
curtain rises on the l9“ campaign of the
Albany State women’s tennis team.

Coach Jim Serbalik returns for the fall
semester to become the Danes' fourth
coach since nineteen-year mainstay Peggy
Mann left. However, Serbalik is no
stranger to the women's tennis program.
Two years ago, Serbalik was the coach
before he took over the men's tennis pro
gram as an interim replacement for Bob
Lewis who was then suffering from a back
iniury. '

The 1984 Dane netwomemare led by
number one singles Deb Leffe who has
brought a good. positive attitude after two
years of personal problems that have
hampered her career.

Sophomore Betsy Aronin has taken over
the number two singles and an ambitious
Gerri Chiodo handles the number three
singles. This trio will have large shoes to
fill as they replace longtime Dane stars
loan Phillips, Mindy Hartstein, and
Lauren lsaacs.

Coach Serbalik says optimisticly,
“Although they may not have as much ex-
perience as them [Phillips. Hartstein.
lsaacs], I really feel they have as much
talent and desire to overcome being
green.”

Returning to round out the singles are
number four Helene Tishler, number five
Ellen Yun, and number six Nancy Tarbes.
Seniors Tishler and Yun bring three years
of experience each. That combined with
solid consistent play, should provide depth
to a small squad. Standing by to fill in at
either singles or doubles. is the surprising
freshman Ellen Katz, three-year player
Nina Cherlng, Jenny Bahrani, and power
player Lisa Valens.

 

There are already a few barriers that
have made an otherwise confident coach
cautiously optimistic. Injuries have
already clalrned belle and Aronin, the
team’s top two players. and freshman
Ka'tz. ‘

"On a team of 10 girls. if we lose anyone
for a long period of time, it could be very
harmful.” These injuries are not severe
and they should all be ready to play by this
week.

The second barrier lies in a tough
schedule that includes a five-game set
beginning with Siena on Monday. The
Dane netwomen face improving teatns like
Oneonta and Plattsburgh. perennial
powerhouses like Binghamton and St.
Lawrence, and unknown commodities like
Middlebury.

Men ’s soccer team beats Manhattan ville, 5—0

By Dean Chang
mm SPOI‘ISBDHDI

In recent years, there were many
unanswered questions about Albany
State's men's soccer team. After the
Danes’ 5 - 0 drubbing of Manhattanville
on Saturday. the only question about this

  
  
 

     

year's team is exactly how good are the
Danes?

The game was every bit as lopsided as
the score indicates; Manhattanville had a
paltry six shots as compared to Albany’s
25 shots. After the fifth goal was scored,
Albany Head Coach Bill Schieffelin

     

removed all of his starters from the game.
“It could have been a much larger

score," said Schieffelin. “We beat them

6 - 0 last year. and there was no reason to

humiliate them. They're not a very strong

team."

The first goal was scored about l0

minutes into the game when the lerry
lsaacs-Tiban Presbie connection started
their act. lsaacs received a pass and touch-
ed the ball over quickly to Presbie, who
was racing into the left of Manhattanville's
so-lkeever-

“l was going in on the goal and I placed
it just inside the left post," said Presbie.
“The goalkeeper had no chance."

Less than 14 minutes later. the lsaacs-
Presbie connection struck again. Presbie
returned the favor and assisted on Isaac's
goal, his first of the season.

With 36 minutes into the game, Warren
Manners got his first goal of the season,
making the score 3 - 0. Albany. Manners
later assisted on Albany's fourth goal of

_the game when Pat DaCosta scored just

1:20 into the second half.

“There weren't too many people that
would score last year." said Presbie. “This
year, the preasure's not on me. If 1 don't
score. someone else will."

season was goalkeeper Howard Tygar, .
who is replacing an injured Tommy Mer-
ritt, sidelined with a bad back. But accor-

hurt. Tvgar might still be in there
