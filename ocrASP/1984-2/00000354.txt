Today’s 1.600. SUNYA School of

Education students certainly bear little

resemblance to the original 29 students.
and so the school is celebrating the pro-
gress that‘s been made iii its I40 years.

Founded in l844, the school is the
parent of what has become SUNY»AIbany.
one of four university centers in the SUNY
system '

The school‘s original budget was $9.600.
Today. the school receives $5 million in
state funding, and $4.5 million in outside
research grants and funding.

The school‘s dean. Robert Koff. ex-
plained the changes the School of Educa-
tion has gone through. In the past. he said.
they were restricted to preparing teachers

‘ for the classroom. That has shifted and

has been enlarged to include a strong com-
mitment to researching, developing. and
improving educational practices. Koff
cited examples of new programs such as
the new curricula in science and methods
of teaching math. '

Today's school includes six depart—
ments: Counseling Psychology. Educa-
tional Administration and Policy Studies.
Education Psychology and Statistics. Pro-
gram Development and Evaluation,
Reading, and Teacher Education.

Each department offers a minimum of a
masters degree program to its students.
and includes intense research within that
particular area of education and learning,
Koff said.

Students. area school district officials.
and educational policy-makers may take
advantage, Koff said, of the programs and
services offered through the School's
statistics and computer facility. Child
Research and Study Center. Reading
Clinic. and the Center for Educational
Research and Policy Studies.

In addition. the school coordinates the
activities of the Capital Area School

Current plans include a major Interna-

Indonesia and six African countries, with
the purpose of conducting policy studies to
“relate economic development concerns to
(the) cconotiiic policy" of the country. ex-
plained Koff.

The schedule of events begins 8 pm.
Thursday night, with the presentation of
the .lohii Ralph Tibbetts Distinguished
Service Award. Friday's events will
follow with symposiums and education
related seminars. These will be presented
by three of the six academic departments
within the School of Education and the
honorary degree award recipients.

Saturday concludes the celebration with
the naming and dedication of the Milne
Room (Ed 335), honoring the important
role that the School of Education's
laboratory school. the Milne School,
played in area education.

Now defunct for six years, the Milne
School served for 6] years as a teaching
