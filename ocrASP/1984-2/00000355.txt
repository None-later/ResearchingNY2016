If the rights of women are to be
protected, not only laws, butvat-
titudes as well must be changed.
asserted New York. Secretary 0
State Gail S. Shaffer. *

Shaffer was the keynote
speaker at the opening ceremony
of the Women's Safety

Awareness Days program'

Wednesday. ,

The event, attended by about
75 people in front of the Campus
Center Fountain, included short
speeches by President Vincent
O’Leary. Vice.President for Stu-
dent Affairs Frank Pogue, Stu-
dent Association Vice President
Suzy Auletta and the new Don't
Walk Alone coordinator Rochelle
Hirschenson.

Addressing the public’s attitude
towards marital rape, Shaffer
said. “Society still seems to view
claims of marital rape as a
bedroom farce... a joke gone
sour."

The real picture is different -
wives who are threatened, who
are forced into uncomfortable
behavior. who are terrorized. Six-
teen states have made marital
rape a crime. We need to add
New York State to that list,"
stated Shaffer.

Shaffer expressed disappoint-
ment in New York State's failure
to pass a law banning marital rape
noting that sixteen other states
have such statutes.

She-pinned much of the blame
for Americans' views of rape on
the media. Women are “por-
trayed as willing victims" by the
entertainment industry. claimed
Shaffer. Such media portrayals
shape the attitudes of the young.

she said. “Can a child's mind sort

out messages as easily as you and

v I?" she asked.

In order to change the views of
society toward. women, Shaffer
asserted that women in the media.
academics, criminal justice and in
the legal profession have a duty to
publicize women‘s concerns.

She said that programs such as
Women's Safety Awareness Days
perform an important function
because they “increase
awareness" of the problems
women face. “‘We need oppor-
tunities to educate society." Shaf-
fer added.

“I don’t think its naive to think
that the majority of Americans
would respond if they had the
whold picture," she said.

Some progress has been made
recently to secure womens rights
in New York, said Shaffer. Dur-
ing its most recent session. the
Legislature established a law
which makes the testimony of a
“corroborating” (third party)
witness unnecessary in order to
convict a person of rape. he
stated.

Shaffer expressed disappoint-
ment that corroborating witnesses
are still required in the cases of

mentally retarded rape victims.

Another positive developntent
for victims of sex crimes, she said,
is the acceptance of videotaped
testimony in child abuse and
molestation cases.

Auletta, who said she
sometimes experiences a racing
heart and pounding in the ears
when she walks alone at night,
said that the women‘s safety pro-
gram “must not be seen as just
three days. Every day should be
Women's Safety Awareness
Day," the SA Vice President said.

Hirschenson said that the ob-
jective of the Don't Walk Alone
project is not only to decrease the
incidence of sexual harassment
and assault. but to train women in
self-prdtection and to provide for
a safer campus.

“I’m very proud of Don’t
Walk Alone," Pogue said, "it
represents the kind of SA-
University planning we must do
more of.”

“The fact of the matter is we
do not live in a ideal communi-
ty,” said Pogue. “It is unsafe in a
number of ways. People,
regardless of sex. color and condi-
tion, have a right to be free from
fear. Women certainly have a
right to participate in this com-
munity without fear,” he
explained.

O’Leary told the crowd that
many men are concerned with
women's safety. Women don't
have a “monopoly” on interest in
the issue, he claimed.

"You all know the rich can't be trusted with money”

By Lisa Mirabella
slum “mu-a

Feminist writer Barbara
Eltrenrcich painted a grim picture
for working women in the next
four years if President Reagan is
reelected; she did not however
offer a serious conviction that the
Democratic Party cundidutcs
could defeat him.

Approximately 150 people, in-
cluding many SUNYA pro-
l'cssors, gathered last night in the
Assembly Hall to licttr
Ehrenrcich‘s lecture on the pover-
ty of working women.

Pointing to low-paying, ‘dcad-

tionally hold, Ehrenreich said,
“Unemployment itself is not the
problem: The problem is that the
employment women have is not
enough to lift them out of
poverty."

“I used to think the idea of
redistribution of wealth was
radical. even as a socialist, until
Ronald Reagan went and did it.
Only he did it in the other direc-
tion...from poor to rich." she
said. "You all know the rich can't
be trusted with money."

The “feminization of poverty"
is how Ehrenreich, the author of
The Hearts of Men, and other
feminist works, sees the effects of
the trend of women working at
poverty level wages. She joked
that equality in poverty was not
the equality the women's move~
tnent was fighting for, and noted
that actually two ottt of three
adults in poverty are women.

Her solution - “expanded
social programs that would create
meaningful and well-paying jobs
for women and minority men."
The funding, according to
Ehrenreich, is to be found in the
inﬂated military budget.

In addition, she called for the
establishment of a pay equity
system, so men and women will
be paid equally for the same job.
Presently, "wotnen are paid otin
60 percent of Wllitl men are

. paid," according to Ehrcnreich.

Finally, Ehrcnrcich stressed the
importance of an. Income Support
program which would supplement
the incomes ol' those working at
poverty level wages. “Welfare
and unemployment wages are not

humiliating because it is money
from the government. but
because it does not serve to lift
people from poverty, so they can
change their own lives,” she said.

Although Ehrenreich views
Geraldine Ferraro's nomination
as Vice-President on the
democratic ticket as “a real
recognition of the feminist move-
ment and of women as a political
presence,” Ehrenreich expressed
doubt as to whether the Mon-
dale/Ferraro team would be able
to defeat Reagan.

“At a time when the sex roles
are more polarized than ever"
Ehrenreich claimed the Reagan
campaign makes it seem as
though gender is the only issue in
the election. She cited recent polls
which show men supporting
Reagan, even if they don’t agree
with him on the issues, because,
as she puts it. “he's the man's
man."

“The most serious threat to
women if Reagan is re-elected
would be the recrimination of
abortion," asserted Ehrenreich.
She said at a press conference
before the lecture that if Reagan
is re~clected “it would be a
disaster for women.”

Throughout the lecture she in-
terspersed serious statistics and
pessimistic predictions of
women‘s economic status with
light anecdotes and dry humor.

Ehrenreich is co-chair of the
Democratic Socialists of
America. who sponsored hcr lec-
ture along with the Women‘s
Studies Program, the Affirmative
Action Office and the President's
Lecture Series at SUNYA. i1

Harassment-defined,

By Johanna Clancy
srxrr warren »

' Ninety-live percent of all
cases involving sexual harass-
ment show the male as the ag-
gressor, SUNYA Director of
Affirmative Action Gloria De
Sole said Thursday.

' De Sole. speaking at a forum
entitled," Sexual Harassment in
the Academic Environment,"
cited two examples of cases pen-
ding in the Affirmative Action
Office.

One female job applicant ac-
cused a full-time graduate pro-
fessor of offering to discuss the
job in his hot tub, said De Sole.
“Someone else got the job," she
added.

A new employee objected to
her supervisor about a plan to
move her to another office, De
Sole recounted. While she was
voicing her complaints, he told
her that there were “ways to
work these things out," and
began to fondle her breasts. said
De Sole.

The woman involved reported
this to a higher supervisor ap-
proximately ten days ago. Dc
Sole said. adding that this super-
visor never reported the inci-
dent. With support of a co-
worker, this woman camc to Af-
firmative Action, and the matter
“is being dealt with," De Sole
asserted.

“Sexual harassment is any
repeated or unwanted verbal or
physical sexual advance, sexual-
ly explicit derogatory
statements, or sexually
discriminatory rcmarks...whiclt

tional Organization of Women

De Sole stressed, “Don't look

to yourself for his behavior."

Women should practice be-
ing assertive. Dc Sole
explained.

In the discussion following Dc
Solc‘s talk, some women shared
their experiences.
