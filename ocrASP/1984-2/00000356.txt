As minority students it is more

social. intellectual. and spiritual

withoutv'each other's assistance
and willingness to involve
ourselves. As a new semester

us. Some experiences shall be

better time is there than now to
emphasize the importance of for-
mulating unity amongst us?
Unity is its essence, is the off-
spring of the meeting of minds,
bodies, and souls simultaneously.
Although the degrees and levels
of unity vary, we need to concen-
trate on its social, intellectual,
and spiritual aspects in order for
the richness of our lives to be

enhanced the duration of our col-
lege years. Let's face it! Most of
us choose a person or group who
will become the sole sharers of
our encounters and source of our
entertainment. in doing so. we
confine ourselves while placing
limitations on advancing
ourselves both pluralistically and
culturally.
As the famous cliche states,
“No man is an island." We all
need each other more than we
would like to admit or recognize.
it is we who more desperately
need the shoulders of fellow
classmates because of our internal
and external struggles as a minori-
ty. Our being here at college is yet
another struggle. We strive to
achieve, knowledge in order that
our mental chains will be unlatch-
ed and we can obtain the
readiness to compete in the labor
force as we become tnore produc-
tive human beings. Often we ﬁnd
ourselves believing that we are in
the ring alone and that it is only
US agianst the totality of the
universe. Wlten taken literally (as

it often is), this belief dissuades
our instincts to bond and thus,
limits our possibilities of
unionizing.

It is true that we must not be ,

vulnerable to the things that pur-
posely aim to destroy us or stunt
our growth. However, at the same
time, we must not void all areas
of social gestures taking reluctan-
cy to its extreme. it is good for us
to be cautious as we journey
through life. but it is not good to
let caution cease the journey.
This university contains many
groups and organizations that we
can join and whose composition
entails things we are on can
become interested in. There are
various functions given
throughout the year that we can
effortly involve ourselves with.
One step trigg'ers another step and
before too long. we will con—
sciously and unconsciously find
ourselves coming to know each
other as we share and observe dif-
ferent personalities and
ideologies. Perhaps the informa-
tion we receive from others. we

if you've attempted to read
your lease and gave up in ex-
asperation. don't feel alone.
Small print, an old-fashioned
writing style and unfamiliar
words combine to make ntost
leases difficult to understand. in
addition, most leases only reflect
the landlord's side of the
landlord-tenant relationship. and
this one-sidcdness adds to their
confusing nature.

landlords hope to keep you ig-

The situation is ttot as bleak as

Most of the one-sided and unfair

if you have a question about your
rigltts as a tenant.

Most leases contain a provision
titled “Tenant's default" which
sets out a procedure the landlord
should follow if you fail to fulfill
your obligations under the lease.
Typically, the lease says the
landlord may give you five days
notice to correct the problem, and "
if the problem remains uncor-
rected after five days. the
landlord may give three days

out-dated provision is only par-
tially true. Under the “warranty
of habitability" law, enacted in
I975, any lease provision which
attempts to have a tenant give up
the right to a safe and habitable
apartment is uncnforccble. Et'tn
if you sign a lease containing an
‘as is" provision, you are not, in
fad. taking the apartment “as
iss". You still have legal recourse
if the apartment is unsafe or
unhealthy. This recourse may in
clude a reduction in rent to reﬁt-ct
the decreased valuse of the apart-
ment due to the unsafe condition.
You may also have the right to
sue if you are injured or your Pm'
Petty damaged as result of the un-
safe condition. Rememher. the
“as is” clause is valid in regard to
non-health and safety related
aspects of the apartment.

The “warranty of habitability"
law mentioned above also affects

students, in fear of being evicted, would
not report landlord problems to the Code

could become a serious problem,

According to Alvaro, the Bureau “takes
that into consideration" when in-
