LETTERS

Pushed around

To the Editor: '

i, like many other students, was very excited about
returning this fall because of the fact that we were living
off-campus. The luxuries of having our own bedrooms.
no more U.A.S., no R.A.'s telling us about quiet hours,
etc. are what we expected. Unfortunately. thanks to the

course faculty and those who live in the downtown cam-
puses are allowed to ride free. This is an example of
discrimination against us, who chose to make the move
off campus.

The University went behind the backs of the students
when they decided to move the Off-Campus Housing 0f-
fice. This office, run by Karieen Karlson and staff, is one
University office that cares about the off-campus
students. The University moved the office from the Cam-
pus Center to State Quad. This office should belnear such
offices as the Off-Campus Association. the S.A. lawyer,
lockers and money-matic. it is now in a quad that is filled
with freshmen who won’t be moving off for at least
another year and across campus from the necessary of—
fices. Thanks again SUNY administrations

Along with the O.C.H.O. another group that is deeply
involved with the off-campus students is the Off-Campus

play the leading role in pulling the superpowers. and the
rest of the world, away from the brink of Armageddon.

Weapons are designed for one ultimate purpose, to be
used. The more weapons each superpower has, the more
likely they are to be used. Therefore additional weapons
decrease our national security. rather than increase it.

Overkill has long been a reality for both superpowers.
Thus. any addition to nuclear stockpiles on either side
serves no practical military purpose. Each superpower
can already anniiiilatc the other with their existing nuclear
arsenals

issue will assume greater importance in the final weeks
before the national election, Learn exactly where the
presidential candidates. and the candidates in your con-
gressional district, stand on the many nuclear issues fac-
ing this nation. NYPiRG can provide you with the
published results of its congressional survey, in which
Representatives expressed their opinions on nuclear
issues. Take the time to make an informed decision.
—Joseph Hilbert
