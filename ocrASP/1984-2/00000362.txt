,Spanier builds .-c'areeron  of

By Jane Anderson
(ISSOL'M TE NEWS EDITOR
As a Ph.D of microbiology and
molecular genetics. Bonnie Spanicr found
ihc history of her female colleagues
fascinating. So fascinating. in fact. that
she gave up laboratory research for the op-
portunity to study women in science.
Spenicr. who was just appointed the
new Director of Women‘s Studies at

SUNYA, began resear-
ching the history of con- 
Profile

temporary women in
science because of her
curiosity about one of
her women professors.

"There was a special grant (from
Radcliffe College) to do studies on women
in American society." Spanicr explained.
“and I was curious to know more about a
woman professor I had had in collcgc. a
science professor, who was this brilliant
woman.”

While studying under the grant shc
received from Radcliffe, Spanicr decided
that she wanted to pursue her rcscarch on
women, and particularly on womcn in the
traditionally mnlc oricntcd ficlds of
science.

“When I discovered the scholarship
about women and gcndcr, both in science
and in gcncrnl. I found that it was so cx-
citing. and so"intcllcciunl|y broadcning.

ourselves? Wc will surpi'iscdly
find that by rciiching out our
hands that llicrc nwniicd it build
,silcntly rcudy to meet us and to
welcome our differences. Now is
lIlL‘ liltch

it’s the law 9

<8
liable for damage which was not
your fault.

Somc leases contain a wivcr of
your right to a jury trial in court
cases relating to the tenancy. This
is not valid in regard to personal
injury resulting from a defect in
the apartment. The jury waiver
clause may be enforceable in
other types of lawsuits, althoufh
the courts have split on this issue.

Most leases include limitations
on your right to sublet or assign
the apartment. Under New York
law. you may have a right to
sublet the aprtmcnt even if the
lease says otherwise. The law
specifies the procedure you must
follow if you wish to sublet. This
procedure ls beyond the scope of
this article, but will be explored in
a future article. '

In addition to the specific laws
referred to above. tenants in New
York have protection aginst un-
fair lease provisions as the result
of a "catch—all" law enacted in
l976 which says that any clause in
a lease which is “uncons- '
cionnble" will not be enforced.
“Unconscionublc” means that
the provision is unreasonably
favorable to one party.

As with all written agreements.
it is best to rcad a lease carefully
before you sign it. Do not rely on
oral promises of the landlord
regarding repairs or any other
aspect of the lease or tenancy.
Everything should be in writing.
Finally. don't hesitate to seek a
full explanation of your loss from
the Legal Services Ofﬁce or the
Off-Campus Housing Office and
do not hesitate to seek legal ad-
vice II‘ a problem arises concern-
ing your rights as a tenant. E]

 

 

 

that I felt that [I‘really wanted to pursue
lt.’ -
' anicr said she had always had an in-
n v he history of science. This, she
add i, tied in naturally to her research on
won.. ’n science.

Spanier stressed that women now enter-
ing science professions are part of the “sc-
cond wave." The first wave. she explained
was in the late I800's. noting. for example.
that there were more female physicians in
Boston in those days than there were in the
mid-l970’s.

“When I started poking around in the
l970's." she said. “there was just beginn-
ing to be an increase in interest on the part
of some women historians. women
philosophers, and women scientists" in the
past involvement of women in scientific
fields.

Just about the time Spanicr started her
own research, in the I970's, questions were
beginning to be raised about gender bias in
the sciences. she cxpliiincd. Biographical
information on fcmnlc scientists was com-
ing to light as well.

"It's an aircn of feminist thinking that
has dcvclopcd more recently." Spnnicr
notcd, “compared to the urcns of women
and literature, or womcn in histroy."

“Women in scicncc is an area that has
luggcd behind " other aspects of women‘s
sluclics, Spunicr said.
