In this material “women are
penetrated by animals, by ob-
jects," she said. Dogs are often
favored by pornography pro-
ducers, Dworkin stated. but eels
and snakes are also popular. Ob-
jects used to penetrate women in-
clude hairdryers, telephones,
guns, and knives.

Pornography also forces
women to act as girls. and,
Dworkin added. pornographic
scenes are often filmed on sets
decorated as children's roomsI to
. increase the illusion.

Black, Hispanic, and Asian
women are all portrayed in por-
nography, and, Dworkin said,
their race makes them candidates
for even greater dehumanization
than white women.

"in this pornography the skirt
.of black women is treated as if it
were a genital and sexual organ,"
she said.

“The ethnicity of Hispanic
women is used to suggest that
they‘re ‘hot' and “ready' for

abuse."

in one 'film involving Asian
women. the, group Dworkin
characterized as the most abused.
“it begins with Asian women
hanging from light fixtures, being
strung up in doorways.”

“There is pornography of the
concentration camps." Dworkin
said, “that says, l walked up to
the gates of Auschwitz, knocked
on the door, ‘Herr Himmler let
me in,‘ and then all the acts that
were committed in concentration
'camps are outlined in graphic
detail from the poittt of view of
the victim for her pleasure."

“Women are murdered for sex-
ual entertainment. Snuff films are
. real," site said, explaining that a
“snuff flint" is a film in which, as
part of the sexual abuse a woman
is murdered and slowly
dismembered.

“in a fraudulent snuff film that
was widely distributed in this
country in 1976. in which the
dismemberment was simulated,
.the final climactic sexual act was
that the man slit the woman’s ab-
domen open. held up her uterus,
and masturbatcd to orgasm,“
Dworkin said.

“There is a private trade in
snuff films in this country. real
ones," she asserted.

“We have witnessed increasing
incidences in emergency rooms of
cases of throat rape. Since the
release of Deep Throat. we have
deaths front throat rape.“
Dworkin said.

Outlining the difficulty of con-
vincing people that pornography
hurts women, Dworkin explain-
ed, the courts say “ ‘show us
some evidence that pornography

I is harmful.’ so we (women)
’ say,‘wcl|, see this woman hanging
’ from a meathook,’ and they say
’ ‘No, site wants to be there. show

us some cvidcnce,‘ " she said.

Dworkin lashes out at porno

<14

Rejecting the argument that
pornography is protected by the
free expression clause ,of the First
Amendment. Dworkin argued.

“The first amendment is fun-
damental to this country - you
will hear that a lot - and it is... it
was written by white men, many
of whom owned slaves," she

 

pointed out.

Many of the signers of the Con-
stitution say women as "chattles.
moveable property," said
Dworkin.

“The reason that the first
amendment is first is that there is
a virtually absolute relationship
between literacy and ownership of

property." she continued.

“The ﬁrst amendment protects
people who can read and write
and express, themselves against
government interference."
Dworkin said. “Its meaning is
that ‘them that's got gets. and
those that don't can drop dead’."

“What the first amendment is
now being used to do in this coun-
try is to empower pigs - that’s it."
she said.

“The idea is that the more

speech they have, the more speech
we (women) have. and we are sup-
posed to be stupid enough to
believe that. But, we are their
language!" Dw'oririn maintained.

“Our bodies are their language.
we are their words. They can’t
make their sentences without ex-
ploiting us." she said;

This is a Civil Rights issue: “it
is the exploitation of a group of
people because of a condition of
birth." said Dworkin.

“Civil rights law, unlike the let
Amendment. is not basic” to. the
Constitution. she contendedw
“Civil rights law-exists because
some people fought for hand in
some cases died for it.” DWoritln
asserted. “Sex discrimination is
included in civil rights law
because a racist southern senator
thought it was a joke." Dworkin
announced.

However. Dworkin, said. it is
because of that senator’s attempt
to derail the Civil Rights Act that
another avenue of fighting por-
nography is now open to women.
One that doesn't question First
Amendment rights. ,

Dworkin described a law being
enacted in Minneapolis. of which
she is co-author, that says “we
can sue those'who traffic in por-
nography because they are traf-
ficking in sexual harassment."

“Fundamentally. it's not dif-
ferent from some clean air acts," ,
she said. since those acts allow so-
meone to sue air polluters even it'
they don't have some pollution
related disease.

“No bill of rights worth the
name can sanction such injury.
and such harm to a class of per—
sons because of a condition of
birth. and still have any integrity
as a bill of rights," she stressed to
the audience.
