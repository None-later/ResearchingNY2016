“He is similar to Milano in the

Ford. “He has a quicker release

Russell was better known for his
wrestling talents rather than his
quarterbacking abilities. Aside
from his wrestling accolades at
Mount- Pleasant High School and
Linton, he also-was a member of
Joe DeMeo’s Andirondack
Wrestling Club, which produced
three l984 plympians. including
Jeffrey Blatnick. the gold-medal
winner. '

So it was by great surprise when
Russell expressed interest this
summer in playing college foot-

Russell's football coach at Lin-

that conversation by sending a let-

bother the Schenectady native.
He still set his sights high. He was

would; he was gunning for the

This season, the Eagles have been

two contests.

According to Ford, the Eagles
possess a good crop of talent and
have a well-sized defense. but he
feels there’s something missing,

'“They’re not a cohesive unit,"
said Ford. whose club has a 9-l
past record against Brockport.
“Through the years they‘ve never
been too organized and i can't en-
tirely blame it on their coach
(Keith Moody). lirockporl has
good athletes but the team with
the best athletes don’t always

The “good athletes" Ford is
referring to is their quarterback
Tony Lott and their fullback Reg-
gie Richardson. According to
Ford, their defense is well-sized
and strong.

“We heard they've gt a large
defensive line," said Russell,
“but they’re not so quick.”

The Danes hope to put the ball
in the air more this week,

it was. to Coach White’s recollection,
the ﬁrst victory ever by Albany State’s
women against both Bates and Mid-

the Danes in his four years of coaching.
“I am so pleased...so psyched." ex-
claimed the ebullient Coach White. “The

women's combined time was 96:33, only
10 seconds off the University record. To
do that well this early in the season is just
phenomenal." .

The team was led by junior Lynn
Jacobs, the transfer student from Missouri
State. Lynn clocked in at 18:49. only 5
seconds off her personal best time of
18:54, good enough to give her third place
in the overall standings behind Doras
Derhartog of Middlebury. (18:03.3), and
Kathy Kramer of Bates, (18:44). The next
ﬁnisher was Bette Dzambn, (2nd for
Albany and fourth place over-all). with an
outstanding personal best time of 18:55,
and immediately following at 18:56 was
teammate Karen Kurthy.

This gave Albany three runners ﬁnishing
in the top five positions. a key factor to
their victory. it should be noted that all
three girls turned in times of under i9
minutes, a remarkable feat for so early in
the season.

The fourth finisher for Albany was
freshman Rachel Braslow, (llth place
overall), who completed her first collegiate
varsity cross country race in l9z49. her per-
sonal best. According to White. “To break

Sullivan and Kim Patch, who finished

Coach White could not have been more
pleased with the team's overall perfor-
mance. “We beat three of the best Divi-
sion lll cross country teams in the country;
we're now 3-0 against cross country
powerhouses. "

The women increased their record to 4-0
with a l5-50 victory against Skidmore Col-
lege on Tuesday. Because Skidmore's team
consisted of young, inexperienced runners,
Coach White's strategy was for the team to
run together in a pack. This would enable
the team’s faster runners to rest up for

Ted Mondale,
Sonia Johnson
deride Reagan at

SASU weekend

" By Andy Leahy
OSWBOONIAN

Citizen's > Party Presidential candidate
Sonia Johnson and Ted Mondale, son of
Democratic nominee Walter Mondale. ad-
dressed a decidedly anti-Reagan group
during a three day electoral conference
sponsored by Student Association of the
State University this past weekend.

Representatives of various political par-

, ties and lobbying groups. were on hand, as

approximately 180 'students from .across
the SUNY system attended the workshops
and speeches at the Empire State Plaza.
Mondale's son spoke on behalf of the
Mondale/Ferraro campaign Sunday morn-
ing, thanking the crowd for the voter
registration campaign, which, he said he
believes, will affect the elections in favor
of the Democrats. He contended that the
unregistered citizens tend to be those most
in favor of a Mondale presidency.
Mondale lambasted President Ronald
Reagan on many issues and appealed to
the common bond of age he had with his
audience to charge that Reagan is a threat
to."our future." .
Students will pay the price, said Mon-

dale, for Reagan's unprecidented deﬁcit ,

spending, adding “it is not pessimistic to
tell the truth . . . and it is defeatest to ig-
nore issues.”

“You know. they say, ‘Ronald Reagan
is such a leader?“ Leader? Leading us to
what?” Mondale demanded of the
audience. .

The local press covering Mondale’s

. speech posed questions afterwards regar-

ding Democratic Vice Presidential can-
didate Geraldine Ferraro's ﬁnances and
concerning the conservative hecklers who
have been disrupting Democratic cam-
paign appearances.

“The only people with questions on her
(Ferraro's) tax problems are the media,"
Mondale answered to applause from th
audience. -

Mondale also said he believes that the
“Fritz-busters" showed a pattern of coor-
dination and organization to their disrup-
tion of speeches, but declined to charge
that the Republican Party was behind the
effort.

Mondale conceeded that the hecklers
were within the law, but added, "the
limiting of debate is not what America is
all about.”

Johnson, in her speech Saturday night,
attacked both major parties and expressed
hope that her party would gain popularity
with the voters.

Johnson asked the audience to shout out
things they would do if elected president.
and then told the students that they had.
more or less, just set down her platform.

Calling up Soviet leaders to propose
nuclear weapons negotiations, pulling
covert aid out of Nicaragua, moving for
the passage of the Equal Rights Amend-
ment and for military budget cuts were
among the things the audience called out.

Johnson/Bush representative Joe
Spargo took‘questions from the audience
on short notice Saturday after handing out
blank voter registration forms and stress-
ing that the Republican Party is equally
committed to registering new voters.

Spargo, however. was not able to
answer questions on foreign policy because

Central Council bans ROTC.
-tablin-g.+in»x€mpus«6<enter ~

lf ROTC wants to solicit in the Cam-
pus Center they'll need special permis-
sion, but nobody‘s quite sure who they
can get it from.

SA. which governs the right to table
in the Campus Center, has decided to
deny all ROTC solicitations.

There is no formal appeals process.
Director of Campus Life James
Doellﬁeld said he does not recall a case
like this occuring in the past, but that it
could probably be appealed to "senior
administrators." SA President Rich
Schaffer said he thinks ROTC can ap-
peal the decision to Central Council,
SA’s Supreme Court, or University
Council.

The decision to ban ROTC solicita-
tion in the Campus Center was made by
Central Council last Wednesday. after
they debated the issue for more than an
hour. The rationale behind the resolu-
tion, which passed 15 - 3 - 0. was that
SA must make a stand against the
army’s “discriminatory policy" of not
permitting gays and lesbians to become
commissioned ofﬁcers, which most
students do upon completion of the
ROTC program. .

Schaffer.‘ one of the bill's sponsors,
told Central Council that the army's
policy is “outright discrimination. if we
don’t pass this. we are continuing
discrimination. "

“Stop pussyfooting around here by
saying we’re going to ﬁght discrimina-
tion when its convenient," Schaffer
demanded.

SA Vice President Suzy Auletta told
Council that the University administra-
tion has repeatedly stressed its opposi-
tion to discrimination. Yet, when faced
with this issue, Auletta said. the ad-
ministration has refused to
acknowledge any discrimination, even
though the army admits it will not per-
mit gays and lesbians to become com-
missioned ofﬁcers.

University ofﬁcials have said in the

past that the ROTC program is not
discriminatory because all students can
participate in the program.

However, SA contended in their
resolution that allowing all students to
participate isn't enough. “The goal of
the vast majority of SUNYA students
when enrolling in ROTC courses would
be the attainment of a placement in the
formal commissioning program,” from
which gays and lesbians are excluded.
the resolution stated.

Council members opposing the
resolution argued that the bill infringed
upon freedom of speech and that many
students depend on the ROTC program
as a means of ﬁnancing their college
education.

“i don’t think we should deny a
group the right to solicit just because we
don't agree with them.” asserted Coun-
cil member Steve Russo, who voted
against the resolution.

Council member Greg Rothschild,
who also voted against the resolution,
told Council, “There are people who
are beneﬁtting from it (ROTC) and
who are in college because of it — this is
unfair to them.”

The issue ﬁrst came to SA's attention
when a student, noticing that ROTC
was tabling in the Campus Center early
last week, complained to SA that
ROTC should have solicitation rights
because of its “discriminatory
policies."

SA had passed a bill two years ago
calling for the ROTC program to be
ousted from the campus.

Auletta told Council she hopes to put
a similar bill through University Senate
this year.

SA Director of Student Programs,
Patty Salkin, said Monday night that
she had drafted a letter to ROTC of-
ficials, informing them of Council's
decision. They have not she said, re-
quested a solicitator’s form since Coun-
cil made the decision last Wednesday.

ROTC officials could not be reached
for comment. 1]

 

Moynihan helps '

> School of Ed

celebrate1 40th
in CC Garden

By Lisa Mirabella
STAFF WRITER

Making a quick visit to the SUNYA
campus. US. Senator. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan stressed the importance of
quality. standardized education in his ad-
dress Saturday morning at the Convoca-
tion of the l40th anniversary of the School
of Education.

He cited the ‘Ecole Normalc’ of France
as an example, stating that in order for
schools and social programs to be of real
value to a society, they must be structured
so they reach the most people in the most
effective way.

Albany’s School of Education was
founded on that model as the ﬁrst “nor-
mal school," or teachers college in New
York State. in 1844.

The Convocation was the last in a three
day series of events to celebrate the
school’s 140th anniversary, and included
the conferring of honorary degrees and
awards.

In accepting a Distinguished Service to
Education Award, American Federation
of Teachers President Albert Shanker
praised the University as "an example of
the successful combination of trade
unionism with excellence in profes-
sionalism." Shanker is vice-president of
the AFL-ClO and has authored the weekly
column “Where We Stand" on education,
labor and human rights issues for the past
l3 years.

President of The New York Times Com-
pany foundation, Fred Hechinger. who
writes a weekly column entitled “About
Education" for The New York Times. and
who was education editor there for 10
years, received the same award as Shanker.

SUNYA President Vincent O'Lcary
opened the ceremony by reminding the au-
dience that the school’s founders had on
May 7, 1844. dedicatedthe school to “ed-
cucating school teachers in the science of
education and the artof teaching."

He also pointed out that the University
still holds to the school’s original committ-
ment of providing a “liberal education."

The ﬁrst class of the Albany Normal

1 School had 29 students. Its ﬁrst year fun-

ding “included a $9,600 subsidy from the
state's Literature Fund and the promise of
$10,000 annually, at least for the ﬁrst ﬁve
years." according to a press release from
the School of Education.
