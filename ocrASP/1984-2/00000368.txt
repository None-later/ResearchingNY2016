Professor Wlillam Kennedy

He begins a tour of Europe this month.

Spotlight on Kennedy examines
the writer, his city, his institute

By Mike Taubleb

SUNYA's Pulitzer prize winn-
ing author William Kennedy has
put the city of Albany on the
literary map, drawing a lot of at-
tention to himself and bringing
some well-known writers to the
campus.

Kennedy's Ironwood, for which
he won the Pulitzer prize, has
been listed on the New York
Times Best Seller List, and Ken-
nedy himqu was the subject of a
proﬁle in the Sunday New York
Times Magazine.

Nobel prize winner Saul
Bellow, who spoke on campus
last spring, insisted many years
ago that Kennedy deserved credit
as a ﬁrst rate novelist. According
to Kennedy's close friend
Margaret Crogden, who wrote the
Sunday Times Magazine proﬁle,
“much of the credit for bringing
Kennedy to the public's attention
should be attributed to Saul
Bellow."

"Literary recognition by
publishers was beyond his (Ken-
nedy's) grasp until
Bellow. . .recomrnended to Vik-
ing Press that they reconsider
their rejection of Kennedy’s
lronweed," explained Crogden.

“With the subsequent choice of
Kennedy as a Pulitzer prize win-
nerhisstarhasrisentothe
forefront of the literary com-
munity,” related Capital District
Humanities Program Director
Kathryn Gibson.

Since lronweai’s publication,
Kennedy has received a full pro-
fessorshlp at Albany, a $264,000
grant from the MacArthur Grant,
the New York State Governor’s

Soon after winning the MacAr-
thur award, Kennedy, along with
SUNYA English professor Tom
Smith, lain down the foundation
for the Writer's institute at
Albany, which was funded by
$15,000 from the MacArthur
Foundation, and a $15,000 grant
from SUNYA.

by Kennedy on creativity.

"Hopefully the enthusiasm
generated by the celebration

perpetuated for many years to
come in this area,” Gibson
added.

Problems with obtaining visas are
complicating attempts to secure
dates for all of these writers.
Smith said.

Last week, Toni Morrison, the
celebrated black novelist who will
join SUNYA’s staff in the spring.
spoke as a guest of the Writer's
institute.

Kennedy will begin a European
tour this month, as lronwccd is

SChOol of Education-"gamers $11

. By James Geracl

SUNYA’s prowess in educational
research has netted it the two largest con-

tracts that this institution has ever received _

The grants. totalling SILB million
dollars, will allow the School of Educa-
tion, now celebrating its 140th anniver-
sary, to evaluate the educational systems in
African, Asian, Middle Eastern and the
Carribean countries, according to Educa-
tion Dean Robert H. Koff.

The larger contract, totalling $7.1
million dollars. was the result of negotia-
tions between SUNYA and the govem-
ment of indonesia. As part of the pro-
gram, SUNYA has committed itself to
provide educational research and recom-
mendations on programs in indonesia.
Koff said. _

Greater access to the entire SUNY
system will be'made available to indone-
sian graduate students, as well, Koff
noted. He said SUNYA received the con-
tract in part because, “the SUNY system
has the capacity to do many things that the
indonesian government wouldn’t get from
many other systems." The primary reason
SUNYA was awarded the grant was the
recognition the school has received for its
educational research program.

The other contract, worth approximate-
ly $4.7 million. was awarded to SUNYA
by the United States Agency for Interna-
tional Development(AiD), Koff said.
Albany's contract .was part of a $30
million federal grant from AID to a con-
sortium of colleges, led by Florida State
University, to evaluate the educational

 

programs in various countries. he

explained. .
“The wo'rk that we have contracted to
do is primarily concerned with providing

technical services to six developing counf ‘

tries." said Koff.

“Future projects
may include cost
analysis and
program design

wor .”
—David Chapman

The targeted countries include
Botswana, Liberia, Nigeria, Yemen, and
Haiti. Other countries to be included at a
later date are Pakistan. Nepal, Zambia.
and Niger, Koff said.

Speaking of the beneﬁts to be gained by
SUNY students working abroad, “Many
of our students may have the oppertunity
to travel abroad under the provisions of
these grants to provide various kinds of
technical services."

Panelists say women of color face

additional hardships in white world said

I By Leslie Chait

“Ever since slavery, they (black women)
have been sexually exploited by white men,
through rape or forced sexual services,"
asserted Druis Knowles, a commissioner of
Budget Staff ofﬁcer for the State.

Women in today’s society face many
Cultural and economic barriers. Last
Wednesday, four panelists outlined the ad-
ditional hardships women of color face in
the world.

Black women. according to Knowles,
have always faced problems both as
women and as blacks.

Even on the slave ships to the New
World. black women were treated dif-
ferently, although. she said women had

4 more freedom “because they were mothers
and . . . because they were females — they
had the sailors lusting after them,”
Knowles explained.

The forum, entitled "Women of Color:
Are Their Safety issues Differentl,"
discussed both historical and current pro-
blems women of color are often faced
with.

Knowles, quoting from Gerta Ladncr,
author of the book Black Women in White
America, said that “black women have
always been more conscious of and more
handicapped by race and sex oppression.
They have been subjected to all the restric-
tions against blacks and to those against
women. in no area of life have they been
permitted to attain higher levels of status
than white women."

There are two perceptions of black
women, according to‘ Knowles. The
matriarch, and the docile woman.

The matriarch is in control of things,
“she calls the shots, and the men are
powerless," Knowles explained.

The docile woman, said Knowles, is a
complete opposite to the matriarch and is
submissive, passive and supportive of her

man.

Knowles went on to mention four other
types of women. The mommy,‘ the pro-
miscuous woman. who has no set morals
or values, the supcrwoman, who Knowles
said She considers herself to be, is
educated, works. has a family, and is sup-
portive. The fourth, the sapphire woman,
knows what she wants and she knows she’s

good, said Knowles.

The main thing that all these types of
women have in common is that they all
have to “walk a thin line when dealing
with their personal safety," according to»
Knowles.

New York State Afﬁrmative Action of-
ficer Marita Vega read a definition of sex-
ual harassment from the Civil Rights Act
of 1964. which stated that sexual harass-
ment is “any unwanted or unwelcomed
sexual advance, whether it be physical or
verbal.”

Vega said that aside from physical safe-
ty. it is important to consider emotional
safety as well.

AS an example, Vega cited the fact that
many people, of all races. do not take
evening courses because of safety
concerns.

Vega said there are three major ways to
limit sexual harassment. First, she said,
women should become clear about their
roles in a given situation. Women should
never let anyone take advantage of them,
she said, and they should always be ﬁrm
and in control of themselves.

Second, said Vega, women should be
conﬁdent and should never walk with ner-
vous expressions on their faces, as this may
invite attacks.

Third, Vega said, women need to be
assertive. “Know what your rights are. if
someone does something to you, don't feel
that you have to tolerate it. Take action,"
said Vega.

Black women do face unique safety pro-
blems, asserted Laurie Mldgette, a junior
at SUNYA. “As a black woman student
on this calnpus, there is an unmistakable
difference between violence that may hap-
pen to the white woman student as com-
pared to violence against the black woman
student," she said.

Midgette went on to say that “as a black
woman student, I feel it is frustrating go-
ing through all the red-tape and ﬁnding
that nothing is being done." v

Women of color, the panelists urged.
must be aware of what is happening in
their environment. Sexual harassment.
they said. takes both subtle and obvious
forms, and can be found in almost any
situation. Cl

AIV 00".” UN

SUNY campuses will be used to provide
education for approximately 300 indone-
sians, who will be participating in highly
specialized, short training programs, Koff
explained. adding, “The State of New
York beneﬁts because these students have
their tuition paid, and they receive a
sizeable stipend, so they are expending
these resources in the state.”

SUNYA Education Professor Douglas
Windham has been named associate direc-
tor of the consortium in the MD contract.
Windham, who is also Albany's institu-
tional Coordinator of the contract, is
already doing research in Yemen. Koff

SUNYA Education Professor David
Chapman, who is also the Associate in-
stitutional Coordinator, said that, at this
stage, ‘jsector assessments" in the various

tors in the educational systems." he said.

Future projects may include assistance
in such areas as cost analysis and program
design. training, and disseminating infor-
mation about project activities among the
countries involved, according ‘ to
Chapman.

Koff expressed the important beneﬁts
that both contracts have for_the whole
SUNY system, including. international
development opperturtltles for SUNY, the
faculty, and the students. The contracts
will provide, Koff said, a display of the
depth of resources of the SUNY system, as

' well as financial beneﬁts.

"We are sending overseas a variety of
faculty in a number of areas- from
Agriculture and Technical on down the
line," explained Koff. “Obviously.
SUNY-Albany doesn’t have Agriculture
and Technical faculty or programs. but the
SUNY system does. So, in effect, we’re
drawing on the resources of the SUNY
system,” he said.

in addition, the participating govern-
ments will be better able to attain their
goals of educational and developmental
progress, as well. Koff said.

"i've seen it (progress) most dramatical-
ly in this project because of the very ﬁne
receptivity of both the embassies and host
governments toward our projects,"'Koff
said, adding, “i fell that there have
(already) been some very immediate policy
reorientations and decisions based on
some of our work."

’ The grants will help boost SUNYA's
“very high credibility in the ﬁeld right
now, " Koff said. El
