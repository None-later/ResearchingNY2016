testimony was Advocate
given in Albany
on June 19. I984:

The Graduate Student
Employees Union is currently
organizing and seeking to repre-
sent the Graduate Assistants,
Teaching and Research Assistants
who work for the State University
of New York. The union
represents a potential constituen-
cy of 4,500 salaried employees
who perform vital educational
functions and teach a signiﬁcant
amount of the course load at the
university centers.

Graduate Assistants grade and
counsel students, lecture, and
perform necessary support ser-
vices for faculty members.
Research Assistants work in the
laboratories and libraries of the
university centers. performing
much of the actual technical and
mental labor of the research

endeavor. and Teaching
Assistants have full responsibility
for teaching courses.

it is our constituency. along

with professors. who bring irl'

research grants and other funding
to the individual universities and
the state. Furthermore, it is the
lalent'and energy of our consti-
tuency that is considered a prime
factor in the evaluation of the
academic quality of SUNY by
American and international peer
institutions.

Grad student union vitali
to keep up SUN Y’s good standing I

As professional employees. our
members have a vital interest in
the quality of education at
SUNY. and in the designated
tasks of the independent Com-
mission on the Future of SUNY.
Unfortunately, our current status
does not bode well for “the
future of SUNY." Allow me to
brieﬂy describe our status.

Currently, the average pay for
a graduate student employee is
55.0!” per academic year. The
largest salary permitted under
state guidelines is approximately
39.0“) over a twleve month
period. Thre are graduate
employees at and near the poveny
level. These low salaries make it
necessary for many of our
members to moonlight in order to
support themselves and their
families at a subsistence level.
Furthermore. these salaries are
less than those at other major in-
stitutions of higher education.
The salary levels of graduate stu-
dent employees in the SUNY
system are not only un-
competitive, they are a disgrace.

We would like to point out that
our work load is directly related
to the quality of education at
SUNY. Overcrowded classrooms
and laboratories already mean
less individual attention, less
laboratory supervision. and less
time for course preparation. As
responsible educators. we do not
want to reduce the amount of
time per student. Therefore,
when class or lab size increases.
our work load increases greatly.

The commission should be
made aware of the deteriorating
educational support system at the
state universities. There has been
no signiﬁcant growth, and in
many cases real decreases in
SUNY's funding of library salary
lines. library acquisitions,

laboratory equipment and su
plies, ciencal staff. office equ'
ment and supplies. ma'

.' By Ilene Welnateln

The Hispanic population in this country
is both’underrepresented and falsely
represented In the media. panelists charged
at a Hispanic Heritage Week workshop
last Friday.

Just over nine percent of US. residents
are of Hispanic descent, but only 1.3 per-
cent of the journalists in this country are
Latino, asserted panelist Albert Cappas.

the forum. which stressed the need for
better coverage of culterai diversity by the
media, featured three panelists who
discussed and debated Hispanic participa-
tion in broadcast and print journalism.

Broadcasters would be more receptive to
minority programming if minority
organizations provided outside ﬁnancial
backing, asserted panelist Patricia
Trowers, director of public service for
WTEN-TV in Albany. Feedback from
viewers is also important, Trowers con-
tinued, urging members of the Hispanic
community to send letters to their local
stations.

“The key in broadcasting is for
minorities to get behind the scenes,”
Trowers said. People who make the deci-
sions in broadcasting are the producers
and the program directors, and very few of
these people are Hispanics or Blacks,
asserted Trowers. She maintained that this
is one reason “shows like A.K.A. Pablo
are produced which are questionable
representations of Hispanics.”

Cappas said Latino newspapers must
struggle just to stay in existence.

“There are 900 Latino newspapers.

magazines and journals with a combined
circulation of 4 million copies and in the
post. only 20 percent of the newspapers
and 5 percent of the magazines survive
beyond the second year." said Copper.
who is director of communications for the
New York State Division of Youth.

Anglo advertisers. he explained, are not
interested in using the Latino media. and
the Latinos do not support their own
media.

The media “is a business like any other
business," explained Trowers.

broadcast in Buffalo. explained Copper.
noting that Capital District stations don't
broadcast them because "they don't feel
there is enough of a Hispanic population
here."

“Latinos In broadcasting must reach out
to Latinos in the community before
Anglos condition them to Anglo perspec-
tives." charged Cappu, who explained
that the media conditions people. leaving
them with certain attitudes. '

Cable television might be willing to
carry Hispanic programming. said

“Latinos in broadcasting must reach out to
Latinos in the community. ”

—AIbert Cappas

 

During her presentation on minorities in
broadcasting, Trowers said that according
to 1980 statistics, 3.4 percent of Albany
residents are Hispanicpand 6 percent are
Black.

“These ﬁgures do not attract broad-
casters because they do not represent
dollars," she said. adding that programs
for minorities show that stations are com-
mitted to their viewers.

“There are economics in the media,"
Cappas agreed. Hispanic television pro-
grams from New York City are being

Trowers. She said she felt that public ac-
cess stations on cable are rarely utilized.
but should be.

It's difﬁcult to get people involved in
public access television. Cappas
countered. because there are no paid posi-
tions. For example, Cappas explained.
Latino public affairs series have hosts that
do a variety of other jobs, including pro-
ducer, director, and programming direc-
tor, and are not paid for any of them,
while Anglo public affairs series have their
own paid staff.

“As Latinos. we are enslaved to public
service," Copper charged.

Schools are good sources of new talent.
explained Trowers. adding that they

' should make an effort to recmit Hispanics

and Blacks.

“There are a lot of resources out there."
in the forms of scholarships and program
for minority students. but many of these
are not being utilized, explained Cappu.

“There is a myth that one needs creden-
tials to get into the media.” he laid, ad-
ding that 40 percent or more of the ex-
ecutive in the media industry have only a
high school diploma. “One needs to have
only the interest and a natural ability." he
asserted.

The problem of differing languages is an
important barrier in the Hispanic media
industry, the panelist contended. adding
that media programs are usually recorded
in English to reach as broad a range of
people as possible.

“We must decide whether we want to
convey the message to ourselves as
Hispanics or to mainstream America "
before deciding whether to record pro-
grams in English or in Spanish, explained
moderator Carmelo Rivera. host of
Hispanic Perspectiva, on WTEN-TV in

Albany.
