.I. Gibson. of Cornell University.
received an honorary degree in
conjunction with her work in

developmental psychology.

According to School of Educa-
tion Dean Robert Koff.
“Professor Gibson is an eminent
social scientist whose works have
long been Identiﬁed with creative
studies of how children learn."

An honorary degree was
awarded to Dr. James S. Col-
eman. a professor at the Universi-
ty of Chicago and a social scien—
tist who. “ever the last two
decades has made a series of ma-
jor contributions (to educa-
tion.)." Koff said. adding. “Dr.

ship between home and school

mains a landmark.”
