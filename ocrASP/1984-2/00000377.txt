(COLLEGE PRES? SER VICB)The total cost
of attending college this school year will
increase only six percent over last year. a
new report by the College Board
concludes.

Over the last few years. said College
Board President George Hanford, college
costs have increases l0-toil percent a year
as colleges boosted tuition to keep pace
with high interest rates and inflation.

The comparatively small increase in this
year’s college costs marks what many ex~
pens hope is an end to the double-digit
cost increases of the last several years.

At public schools. moreover, the in-
crease amounts to only a five percent rise
over last year. making the total cost $4881
for four-year resident students, and $3998
for students at two-year schools.

Private school students aren't faring
quite as well. Costs of attending private
colleges are up seven percent over last
year. for a total cost of $9022 at four-year
schools and $7064 at two-year institutions.
the study of over 3000 schools nationwide

reveals.

But the College Board ﬁgures may be a
bit deceiving. pointed out Meredith Lud-
wig with the American Association of
State Colleges and Universities (AASCU),
which is conducting a similar survey for
release later this fall.

“Many schools are still involved in the
legislative process (for state funding) and
tuition and fees haven’t been set yet," she
said.

“We expect (this year's cost increase) to
be a little less than last year's." she

speculated. probably around “six-to—eight

. percent“ when all the ﬂgures‘ are In.

The cost increases of the last few years
came because colleges had put off things
like building maintenance'and salary in-

creases during the seventies in an effort to i

hold down tuition and fees, said Kathleen
Brouder. associate .dlrector of College
Board's Scholarship Services.

This year's curtailment of cost increases,
she added. may mean colleges have finally
caught up with such deferred expenses.

Now that inﬂation has subsided and in-
terest rates are down. agreed AASCU's
Ludwig, college costs could level off for a
few years.

But Ludwig and College Board ofﬁcials
are quick to note they really aren’t sure
why costs increased so little this year.

“Everybody's been saying it's because
colleges have ﬁnally caught up with ex-
penses and because the economy is bet-
ter.” she said. “But we’re really just using
that reason because there aren't any other
explanations."

“Don't clam up - write a letter to the editor!”
