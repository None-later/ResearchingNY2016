the women’s varsity soccer team

Raiders was termed as a must win
by Head Coach Amy Kidder.

in an exciting, hard-fought
contest that went into overtime,

score of 2-1.

The team came into this impor-
tant match in a scoring slump, not
having scored in their ﬁrst three
games. Throughout the ﬁrst half,
the Danes played very tightly on
offense but also played excellent
defense. Scoring opportunities
were rare for both sides and
goaltender Maureen Keller. play-
ing with an injured hand, played
one of “her best games this year.

Early in the second half, Col-
gate got on the board when Linda
Cosale netted a ball just out of
reach of a leaping Keller. The
Danes regrouped and struck right
back at 3:16 of the second half
when Susan Frost set up freshman
Mary Dulkis for the tying goal.
"It was just a great feed from
Susan, and l was able to beat their

ferent from the Dane Classic. On-

teams can play. A player can't
play both singles and doubles.
Lewis isn't sure how the Danes
will do.

“The format favors teams that

der," said Lewis. “Our strength
is balance and an overall depth."
Unfortunately, this format will
sork against the Danes. The
crowd expectations are low due to
