Alumni ’ouad

By Blek Swanson
‘s'rur warns

Two of Alumni Quad Board’s top posts
are still vacant after no candidate for
either ofﬁce received a majority of votes in
elections held this past Monday and
Tuesday.

Run-off elections for President and Vice
President for Student Programming will
be held this Saturday and Sunday in
Alumni's Walden cafeteria. according to
Quad Board's Vice President for Student
Development lrwin Weinstein.

Three candidates ran for President, and
three contended for the empty Vice-
presidential slot, said Weinstein.

Of these, Olga Colletti and Rich Wilson
made it the presidential run-off, and Billy
Eichorn and Evan Silberberg are com-
peting for Vice President of Programming,
said Wenistein, who is currently sewing as
acting president. ‘

240 votes were cast in the first election,
with none of the three candidates for either
ofﬁce getting a majority over 50 percent of
the votes, which is required to win the elec-
tion, Weinstein explained.

Warren Friss, who was elected President

in last April’s election, said that he decided
to resign before ever taking .the post
because of ﬁnancial reasons.

Friss, currently an RA on Alumni, said
“between school, RA duties and

working. and serving as an Alumni RA,
she felt she would be overextending herself
in serving as Quad Board President.

“I talked Friss into‘running for presi-

she thought he would be “ideal” for the
position.

Alumni Quad Board will sponsor at

held a welcome back party in September,
which was funded by Quad Board but run
by Alumni’s RA staff, according to
Weinstein.

Friss' resignation left the post opento
anyone on Alumni Quad willing to run lot
the position.

Potential candidates were required to
live on Alumni Quad for their term as
president, and they had to submit a peti-
tion with 75 signatures of Alumni
residents.

These two regulations left the post of
presidency open to anyone. including
freshmen and transfer students, Weinstcin
noted, “Those are the rules. Unfortunate-
ly, we can't do anything about it."

According to Alumni Quad Coordinator
Thomas Gebhardt, the Quad Board “hat
been functioning quite well" even with the
post of presidency vacant.

Gebhardt however, said that things will
run more smoothly once the post is fiiltd.

Cartmell 's ups. downs all b

By Bette Dzamba
STAFF WRITE! '

During his four years as an art
critic for the Albany Timu
Union. Cartmell “decided to do
an offbeat article on amusement
parks." He received. he said, 300
letters in response to the story.

“Before that, my articles might
get one or two letters of
response," he noted. “That was
my ﬁrst hint that others were
interested.”

His second “hint” was the
10,000 letters Cartmell recieved in
response to a story he wrote for
the New York Times in 1974.
That was when “the really hard-
core rollercoaster buffs put
together a club," explained Cart-
mell. _“We now have 2,000
members, a magazine, and yearly
conventions. This year is par-
ticularly exciting because it’s the
100th anniversary of the roller-
coaster," he said.

Cartmell’s vast knowledge of
roller coasters has made him
somewhat of a celebrity. He said
he has appeared on over 250
television shows, noting, “l've
been on all of them except
lphnny Carson. it’s rather
bewildering.”

Being an expert on roller
coasters has led to some unusual
experiences, reported Cartmell.
“When the New York Times in-
sisted on a Top Ten Coaster list, 1
put my head on the block," he
said.

A good rollercoaster, according
to Cartmell, has "the right com-
bination of hills and curves. A
good coaster has no breathing
space. The worst curve should
come three seconds before the
end. You shouldn't know you're
slowing down until you stop."

The Coaster Book. should be
available by Christh. The
book draws on Cartmeil’s lifetime
collection of facts and
photographs, including the
research he did in assembling an
exhibit for the Smithsonian
institute. ‘ L

“1 feel it's(his book) an ac-
complishment," Cartmell said.
“1 suffered from every form of
writer's block there is," he
lamented. “The bolt continually
needed to be revised. I received
letters. ‘we just discovered
this...,' ‘Did you know that...? A
photo would appear that i
couldn't leave out. But now," he
sighed. “that's it."

Now that the publisher has the
book,Cartmell is looking forward
to continued print-making and
painting. Undoubtedly, he said,
roller coasters will appear in some
of his works.

And. although he used to try to
keep rollercoaster aficianado Mr.
Hyde. and professorial Dr. Jekyll
separated, he admits that they are
now both integrated into Robert
Cartmell. Cl
