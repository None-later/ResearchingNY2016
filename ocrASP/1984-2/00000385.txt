New-'podiUm policy bars professional vendors I

By Barbara Abrahamar ,
I A new policy governing vendors work-
ing in the campus center fountain area may

This year's vendors are a combination

' of ﬁrst-timers and seasoned veterans.

make it'more difﬁcult for Student Assooia- ,

tion recognized groups to make money.

As a re'sult, of- a policy change that
University Council made early in the sum-
mer. professional vendors are no longer
permitted to sell goods in the campus
center fountain area. in the past, SA
groups have often sponsored these vendors
in exchange for a percentage of the proﬁts.
. ,. Patty Salkin. Director of Student Pro-
gramming for SA. explained that Universi-
ty Council decided that this practice of
sponsoring vendors not afﬁliated with the
university is illegal. “SA doesn't own the
podium. we don't have the authority to
rent space." Saikin maintained.

Director of Campus Life Jim Doeliefeld
added that the policy's “overall objective '
is to keep money spent by university
students. faculty. and staff within the
university community.” .

Les Matles, a professional vendor spon-
sored by the class of '87, was recently ask-
ed by Doellefeld to pack up his goods and
leave. making Matles the ﬁrst casualty of
the new policy.

Jackie Bernstein, president of the Class
of ’87. said she doesn’t understand why

Leslie Reaves, a sophomore from what
she called “money-making Manhattan,"
has been selling cosmetics on the podium
since last month. Similarly. Mark Boyle. a
senior from Loudonville, has only been
operating his record concession for several

well.”

Boyle. a Chinese Studies major, said he
spends about six hours a day. usually twice
a week, selling records.While Reaves ob-

: tains her merchandise from an aunt who

works for a cosmetics companyhlioyle's

records are his personal property. Not only

is Boyle trying to make money to help,

defray college expenses, but he said he is

“S.A. doesnft own the podium.
We don ’t have the authority to
rent space.”

—Patty Salkin

 

the policy was changed. “This is the easiest
way for groups not funded by the Student
Association to raise money," she said.
Matles, said he was puzzled by the new
rule. “SUNYA is the hardes college to get
into to sell," he said. “Some colleges just
impose a set fee for selling privileges," he
claimed, "and at-least they (other colleges)

weeks.

Work for Reaves begins about 8:45

a.m., most weekdays. Reaves said she likes
the fountain area location because she

can get people coming from all direc-

tions." Although she's a psychology ma-

jor now. Reaves said she might turn to
business as a career if she “does really

trying to "unburden" himself of his
overload of material possessions as well.

Dave Wade, a theatre major from
Waterford. and Jan Michaels, a junior
majoring in anthropology, are hardly
strangers to the podium area. Although
Wade is only a sophomore, he has been
selling handmade wooden mirrors at

Generally, students say they like the Von:
dors' presence. “it's like New York City "
explained one sophomore. Another st'u.
dent added that "it brings a touch of
humanity to an otherwise stun,
envrronment."

"Some students. however, expressed
disappointment over the lack of variety of
merchandise available. Steve Deitch,a
freshman from Wantaugh, believes that
there should be “more people. variety, and
competition." Ellenville resident Doug
Siamon added. “most of this stuff doesn’t
capture my personal taste."

Students and vendors were divided on
the issue of professonal vendors on the
podium. Boyle saw no harm in their
presence. One sophomore said that
“professionals won’t harm us. They don't
take money away from anyone.” Michaels
and Wade. however, feel differently. Venv
dors should be confined to persons who
are “university students paying tuition."
according to Michaels. [3

designed with back-ups.

“It is the redundancy in the
system that allowed us to restore
power,” Stevens said.

The two-key fail sale
mechanism designed to warn
employees of the poor connection
did not work. Over a period of
about four days heat built up in
the switch, Stevens said, resulting
in the ﬁre Tuesday night.

At the time of the blackout.
-_. physical plant employees did not
know whether the back-up feeder
line for State Quad could be used
- because it had been shut down by
SUNYA’s power supplier for
maintenance purposes.

Buses had been brought over to
State Quad in preparation for a
full evacuation to the other
quads, when Stevens got word
that the back-up feeder for Stat!
Quad could be used.

Complete power could not be
restored to the podium. however.
until the carbon smoke from the
ﬁre was cleaned off the back-up
switch for the Lecture Centers.

The ﬁre, which was contained
inside the switch cabinet, about
half the size of a car according to
Stevens, was put out by 913'“
employees. Stevens said the tilt
was so hot that the metal cabinet
housing the switch had turned
bright red with the heat.

At the Campus Center several
groups had meetings disrupted by
the blackout. I

How to face 'up to common traffic tickets

and‘avoid any hassles they might cause

  

lr'

By Mark Mishler

Trafﬁc tickets are one of the
most common legal problems en-
countered by students. Although
common, a trafﬁc ticket can
it o n e t h e l e s s
have a serious
impact on your
life. Depending
on the nature of
the charge. and
your previous
rec 0 rd . y o u
may end up losing your license,
paying a large ﬁne, paying higher
insurance rates. or even going to
jail.

This article will trace the story
of a traffic ticket from beginning
to end and explain options
available to you at each step.
Remember that the general infor-
mation provided here is not a
substitute for legal advice. Con-
sult an attorney if you have ques-
tions regarding a trafﬁc ticket.

Most traffic tickets begin with a
law enforcement ofﬁcer who has
personally observed a vehicle be-
ing operated in a manner the of-
ﬁcer believes to be in violation of

 

It’s
The
Law

Mark Mlshler is an attorney.
‘ and director of Legal Services.

the law. The officer will signal to

you, the driver. to pull over to the ,

side of the road and stop. Once
stopped, the ofﬁcer will ask to see
your driver's license. registration
and insurance card. it is a viola-
tion of the law to fail to stop
when directed to by an ofﬁcer. as
is the failure to produce your
license, registration and insurance
card. These actions can lead to
additional charges.

After checking to make sure
the license and registration are
valid the ofﬁcer will issue a
ticket(s) charging you with
whatever violations the ofﬁcer
believes were committed. Do not
lose your cool or argue with the
ofﬁcer. The ofﬁcer is not likely to
change his/her mind about issu-
ing a trafﬁc ticket. You will have
an opportunity later to explain
your side of the story.

in New‘ York, most trafﬁc
charges are not crimes. This
means that you will not be “ar~
rested," will not be ﬁngerprinted,
and will not have a criminal
record if convicted. Thus. in most
instances, you will be permitted to
continue driving after the ofﬁcer
has handed you the ticket. You
will only be placed in custody and
brought to the police station if
you are being charged with a
crime such as Driving While in-
toxicated. Reckless Driving, or
Driving with a Suspended
License. Another article will
discuss your rights if you are
arrested.

The ticket will state the viola-
tion with which you are charged
and will indicate the date. time
and place of your court ap-

pearance. The ticket will also con-
tain certain identifying informa-
tion about you and the car. Minor
mistakes in the information con-
tained on the ticket generally do
not make the ticket invalid.

Once you have been issued a
traffic ticket. what do you do?
Each option described below has
advantages as well as risks and
you should examine the alter-
natives carefully prior to making
a decision.

You can ignore the ticket. This
is ‘against the law and is not
recommended. Some students
take \this option, apparently
believing that due to the enor-
mous bureaucracy the ticket will
never catch" up to them. They are
surprised to discover that this
choice leads ‘to an automatic
suspension , of one’s driver's
license. Driving with a suspended
license is a crime; if caught. you
will be arrested. You may end up
with a criminal record and may go
to jail. The likelihood is that you
will eventually be caught.

The ticket provides an oppor-
tunity to respond by mail. This re-
quires that the relevant portion of
the back of the ticket be ﬁlled out
and that the ticket be mailed to
the Court within 48 hours of
receiving it. Y0ur second option.
therefore is to plead guilty by
mail. This is an admission that
you violated the law. After receiv-
ing your guilty plea the court will
determine the sentence. usually a
ﬁne, and will notify you of the
decision. Pleading guilty by mail
avoids having to appear in court.
However, it also eliminates any
