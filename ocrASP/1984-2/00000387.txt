n the begin! of his term, people

were saying he was falling asleep

all the time. The reason he
falling asleep, we figured, is that he’s up all
night . . . partying like crazy."

John Keenan

The words are Rob Mathew's, the sub-
ject, Ronald Reagan, and the song -”Ronald
Reggae”- is the title track off of Mathew’s
and partner John Foldy's new EP on Blotto
records. ‘

The record, produced by Art Snay and
Broadway Blotto, features four original
songs by the duo, who’ve dubbed
themselves “The Amazing Rob and John
Band." The actual band, however, is simply
Rob Mathews and John Foldy, an acoustic
duo, with aid from various other area musi-
cians, most notably Lee Harvey Blotto on

ums.

The album opens with a pop-rock mix
called "l Give You My Best,” a "nice" song,
but not as good as the albums next three.
However, "i Give You My Best" does give
Rob Mathews opportunity to ﬂaunt his
vocals, one of the most appealing thing
about the record. Mathews, a former
SUNYA graduate student, has been
writing song since high school - one of the
albums cuts, "Veronica Likes To Dance,"
was the product of about four years on-
and—off work.

The second song is the title track,
"Ronald Reggae," a novelty song first per.
formed, interestingly enough, at last year’s
Telethon, where it was met with roaring
student approval. The song boasts lyrics
like:

 

 

Fidel Castro, he's there (00;

plays the congas and sings "Babalool"

it's not particularly deep, but funny
enough, and the song makes for entertain-
ing listening, if not deep satire or the reg-
gae it's title seems to imply.

The second side opens with the album's
strongest cut, a studio mixed song called
"Long Speed," featuring a lot of electronic
wash not used on the rest of the album.
Mathews' lyrics are at there strongest here,
too; although the subject of the song (love
and cars) is nothing particularly new,
Mathews’ ability to fit lyrics into the boun-
cy beat of the melody is probably best

 

 

 

 

described as "nifty." Foldy (who originally
wrote the tune) is fond of pointing out that
he’d written a song about ESP, and
Mathews came along and changed it to
cars speeding down the hidiway.

Finally, the EP closes down with another
strong pop-rock cut, "Veronica Likes To
Dance," which Mathews‘ calls "his" song.
Accessable and catchy, "Veronica" ends
the EP strongly, all in all a very satisfactory
first effort for two Albany boys.

Both Foldy and Mathews have been con-
nected with SUNYA at one time or

another; Mathews, as a grad student who
took his Masters in Computer Science
here, and Foldy as a‘ Communications in-
structor who’s submitting his thesis for his
doctorate this May. They began playing
together a year and a half ago, and hit the
clubs about a half year later. in fact, their
first public appearance as a duo was at
SUNYA’s’own Telethon, last year.
They're both employed full-time, but
are eager to publicize their first record with
hopes of a recording contract. Although
Blotto Records put out Ronald Reggae,

Benton Takes Troubles To

laces In The Heart is a motion pic- -

ture boasting topmotch perfor-

mances, photography, old-
fashioned nostalgia, and stark realism.

At the core though, where it counts,
stands Robert Benton. Benton reached the
pinnacle of success in 1979 when he wrote
and directed the slick but engrossing
Kramer vs. Kramer. After receiving Oscars
for his efforts, Benton turned to a thriller
called Still of the Night. This ersatz Hit-
chcock tribute failed critically as well as

financially. __

For Places in the Heart, Benton
Joumeyed to where it all began, Wax-
ahachie, Texas. in this little town four
generations of Benton’s family have resid-
ed. His new film addresses and salutes
relatives who valiantly fought the depres-
sion of the 30's.

Sally Fields stars as Edna Spalding, a
young woman with two children who is
suddenly widowed when her sheriff hus-
band is accidentally killed by a drunk
youth.

Planes depends on Fielck for stability as
she struggles to keep her family intact
through hell and high water. Fields does
manage to come through, transforming the
helpless widow into an independent.
tough, but loving matriarch; Just look at
her lipI, cyst and hands as the story

 

  

unfolds.

' Fields' performance never rings false,
despite a feeling of deja-vu. Fields has
already won an Oscar for a similar por-
trayal in Norma Rae. Fortunately, her
work in Places displays the proverbial third
side of the coin, and will surely earn her
another deserved nomination.

Sterling performances are also achieved
by Danny Glover and John Maltovlch as a
black colten picker and a blind boarder,

  

respectively. Places utilizes a tornado and
the Klu Klux Klan as vehicles to broaden
the depth of these unique characters. Ben-
ton allows both of them to play off each
other, Just as much as he allows Fields and
her children.

Undlay Crouse hits all the right notes as
Fields‘ caring sister. As the woman who in-
advertantly comes between Cmuse and
her husband, Amy Madigan is fine. Only
Ed Harris, Crouse’s cheating husband. ap-

50 Foldy got in touch with Broadway
Blotto, an aquaintanoe, who aked to pro-
duoe the album. Naturally, Foldy and
Mathews were elated, and so, the Amazing
Rob and John Band
Mathews, Kevin Conroy, David
Dlugolucki, Mel Schiff, Lee Harvey and
Broadwayiwasputinbackofthetwopriw
dples, and with the production know-how
of Art Snay and Broadway Blotto, produc-
ed an E? which may not break into the
mainstream (or even make that big a dent
on the alternative) radio market, but is
nonetheless an outstanding effort by an
acoustic duo who will probably be heard
from again.

"We’ve been getting some airplay from
C08 and RPl," Mathews relates, "but none
from QBK, which we’re a little disap-
pointed at." Still, Mathews and Foldy are
proud of their record, and committed to
finding a market for it. "We've done the
fun stuff. . .making the record, that’s fun.
Now comes the work."

Neither Mathews nor Foldy could say
enough about the helpfulness of the Blotto
people. "They're supemice," Foldy said.
"Broadway was a real good producer,
Sarge helped with the production, Lee
Harvey, of course, played drums. . ."

The pair have "a lot more song," but for
now plan to concentrate on promoting the
EP, on a local scale, with newspaper and
radio ads. The pair also play at Lark Tavern
often, and did a set during Larkfest, also.
"Even if it doesn't take off,” Mathews says,
"[11 always have my record to show to my

kids and grandkids." He grins. "Of course, i
hope it takes 0 .”

The record's greatest problem might 
it’s strong pop-rock influences. Although
the music is good, the "pop" tone may put
off the college stations, while the commer.
cial statiom rarer play anything that col-
lege radio hasn't been playing for five
years already. But whatever the case, Foldy
and Mathews have their record.

Of course, they’d like it to take off.

sympathetically; he's apparently cut from
stone and bleeds granite. An icy stare
coupled with an emotionless voice blend to
create a member of the walking dead. We
are blessed though; his role works more as
a catalyst for Crouse and Madigan to strut
their stuff.

Benton has Nester Almendros to thank
for making Places gel both visually and
cinematically. Credited as Director of
Photography, Almendros creates a
believable 30’s aura via lighting, angles,
and sweeping motion. The employment of
close-ups, pans, and a ﬂoating camera gives
the eye a chance to ingest the tale. Silent
story telling was the norm for years, and
used correctly, a camera can offer proof
positive of the saying "a picture is worth a
thousand words." Places in the Heart fur-
nishes thousands of pictures and millions of
worth.

Places in the Heart idealizes the struggles
of the lots and those who struggled, win or
lose. Beating the odds makes for a '
fascinating picture replete with surprise in-
tangﬁlea. Despite this, Places fails to tug at
the m. it simply lacks the emo-
tional impact of, say, Terms of

arment.
