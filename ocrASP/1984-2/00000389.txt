.rreconcilable Differences, a new
I movie which opened at Crossgates
last Week, features Ryan O'Neal
and Shelley Long as two parents who have
been taken to court by their daughter.
Drew Barrymore plays the nine year old
Casey Brodsky, who attempts to divorce
her parents for neglect. The film is essen-
tially a morality play, dealing with the
.Inhappiness brought about by fame and
fortune in WestCoast high society. it‘s as if
Dynasty was dragged into the People's
Court and lost. . .

 

John Labate

 

The film is built on a series of flashbacks
dealing with the meeting and ill-fated mar-
riage of Albert and Lucy Brodsky (O'Neal
and Long). Albert, fresh out of school as a
Doctor of Cinema, hitches a ride-with
Lucy, headed west. The two tall in love.
marry, and settle in California, where
Albert works as a professor. He is sooncd
lured into the film biz. however, and with
much help from Lucy, writes a screenplay
to a film that becomes a big hit.

While working on a followup film.
Albert falls in love with a young girl,
Albert and Lucy get a divorce; he gets rich
as a filmmaker while his depressed ex-
spouse tries‘ to eat her way out of her
lonlincss.

However. Albert goes bankrupt and is
forced to sell his mansion when he puts all
his money into a film doomed to be a box-
office failure (a musical version of Gone
With The Wind), while Lucy finally sits
down at her dusty old typewriter, and
emerges six months later with a heal-seller.
The subsequent rush of prosperity leaves
her richer and happier, and living in
Albert's old mansion.

Throughout all of this silly, scesawing
plot, Lucy and Albert pay little attention to

 
 

 

 

 

 

    

    

 

 

 

 

their daughter, Casey. She is lett to the care
of their Mexican maid, who gives Casey
the attention she lacks from her parents. By
the lime Lucy and Albert recognize their
neglect, Casey is speaking to them in fluent
Spanish. They continue, however,‘without
dealing with the problem.

This is the kind of film that has you won
over to it's side without even trying: the
side of the child. It's also a paltry soap

.opera. Only‘ because some people get

caught up in such TV dramas will some
people be moved by this film. i did leave
the theatre fooling affected, but it was a
response to the shallowness and
carelessness of the characters. We are given
no idea why they acted as they did. For in-
stance. what motivates Albert to break up
his marriage? Up to that point, he seems

but are told about it, as‘ if it‘s an
afterthought.

The characters (as well as the West Coast
success-failure story) are bigger than life, so
a real human understanding of them 'is
pointless. Once these people find success,
they become arrogant and bitchy. They act
like children living out fantasies of wealth.
And this is where the film loses it's focus. it
starts out as a study of child neglect. What
we get are movie moguls and cocaine-
sniffing actresses rather than a study of
relationships.

The morals warning of the unhappiness
that comes from rapid success and posh,
wasteful living are continually thrown at
the audience. These build until the au-

distanced from the main theme, which is
supposed to be child-neglect. Throughout
the film, little Casey is barely noticeable.
There are plenty of scenes in which the
adults are having fun or buying clothes
while the child sits in the corner and reads
a book. She is brought into the main pic-
ture occasionally, but we feel little relation
to her. She is rarely shown interacting with
others; we are not sure how she is affected
by all that goes on.

The director, Charles Shyer, maintains
his genuine sense of humor throughout.
When Lucy and Albert are at their most
snotty, they are most laughable. As each
becomes wealthy, she surround themselves
with a comical crew of hangers-on. For in-
stance, when Albert plays tennis with his
girlfriend, they act like royalty on the
court. The game is even filmed in slow mo-
tion. letting the audience soak up the well-
to-do image.

irreconcilable Differences does offer
some interesting camerawork at times, dur-
ing which the camera is used to really com-
municate with the audience. At Christmas.
as Lucy sits depressed about her divorce,
the camera darts around her apartment. it
we see an emp-
ty mantclpiece, a single string of holiday
garland, hcr mute typewriter. You feel for
her. Unfortunately, such introspective
cinematography is rare.

Taken on the level of an entertaining,
big budgeted soap opera, Irreconcilaliiu
Differences is not bad. it moves with such a
rapid force that you can overlook its
general insensitivity. However, as a piece
of social commentary, as which it appears
to have been intended, it fails. Irrecon—
cilablc Differences could have been a real-
ly good film, with a relevant subject and a
worthwhile story to tell. That good film
gets lost in the muddle‘ Fl

A. Band That’s

his Sunday, October 7th, the folks

in attendance at Fallfest ’84 will be

in for one of the biggest treats of
the year. The featured band will be one of
the top American bands around, the
Blasters.

 

Joe Romano

“rebandhailsfromLosAngeleandis
made up of amelting pot of musical ln-
ﬂuences, including Dave (guitar) and Phil
(guitar, lead vocals) Alvin, Gene Taylor
(piano), Bill Bateman (drums), John Bazz
(bail), <Steve Berlin (sax), and "Walkin’" Lee

en .

Allen has been in the music business for
about thirty years, and is best known for
his hit fifties single, "Walkln‘ with Mr Lee.”
How, you might ask, did Allen wind up in
an "'80’9” band with young musicians?
Well, the AllenBlasters union goes back to
the band's formative years. According to
Phil Alvin, they met Lee through a guy at a
music store. Phil was about fifteen at that
point. Allen hails from New Orleans, and
bring to the group a solid injection of
rythym and blues.

Gene Taylor is a well-known jazzblues
pianist, and adds just another fine touch to
the Blasters, but it's Phil and Dave Alvin
who are at the core of the band. The sibl-
ings grew up in Downey, California, and

 

haven't always been the best of friends, but _

what can you expect from brothers?

"We fight constantly,” Dave says, but it
was actually older brother Phil who gave
Dave his start in music. Dave remembers
watching his older brother and their
friends jamming on old blues tunes and
thinking "it was bitchin'. . .l just watched
and wanted to do it so bad, but all i did was
play guitar around the house. Phil had
been playing seriously since he was 13, and
he was GOOD. . .when he asked me to be
in the band, i couldn’t believe it, i was so
happy. . .”

There’s never been any regret on Phil’s
part, despite their quips.

in fact, Dave not only weht on to
become lead guitarist, but he also writes
the sow. He acknowledges that the LA.
’50’s rock scene (which spawned greats like
Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, and the
Bumette Brothers) was a seminal influence,
"as well as some of the Mexican music
around here, Black music, the fact that l
was thirteen. i got to meet with Lee, Jr.
Walker, Big Joe Turner. People like that
had a big effect.”

50 you can see how the group has meld-
ed their influences into an assimilation of
true American music traditions, including
rock, blues, country, R and B, and
rockabilly.

 

They do not merely rehash fifties music,
though, (unlike the Stray Cats) but, as
Alvin claims, the Blasters strive for
originality in their sound. They like to add
new twists to the music, while at the same
time paying homage to the artists they love
and grew up on (such as their song “Long
White Cadillac," which is a tribute to the
late Hank Williams).

The bes thing about the Blasters is their
steadfast refusal to compromise their music
for commercial success. "We get paid to do
what we want," Dave Alvin explains, "we
don’t have to compromise. We're real
lucky that people want to come out and
see us. Not everyone gets a chance to ex-
press themselves."

They have had some success on the col-
lege level and among the lucky people that
have seen them live, yet Dave remains un-
changed by it, eschewing any rock idol
lifestyle. in his spare time, he plays in a
folk band with his good friends, John Doe

 

and Exene of X. He also keeps in touch

bands, which is a rare quality in today's
fast-paced music industry.

The road to critical acclaim and little
popular success has been a struggle. The
Blasters (whose name originated as a
shortened version of a previously establish-
ed blues group, jimmy McCracklin and the
Blues Blasters) began in 1979, doing
rockabilly mainly. with bits of RB, blues,
and country thrown in. Since then, they'Ve
progressed into one of the country's hottest
“roots” combos. it began with an LP releas-
ed on a small label and in small quantities,’
which never went anywhere. After that
the group played biker bars and taverns
until their first big break. Members of
Queen saw them, liked them, and put
them on that group's 1981 West Coast

truth. The bani:le wanted to release a

new beginning. ‘1 wanted to write my
that people would understand and relate
to," say: Alvin.

Moreover, he says, "it was important for

. the band to make a statement about how

they felt, or at least about how i felt. we've
accomplished that, in a sense. i don’t just
want to write about can and girls. i want to
keep the lyric real and grainy."

Their second LP, Non-Fiction, brought
Alvin’s ideas out even further, as well as
showcasing their roots even more. it also
gave them a firmer grip on success, which
they admit is partially due to the more ex-'
perimental nature of the 1980’s movie in-
dustry. Still more recently came an ap-
pearance on the Street Of Fine soundtrack,
and their new album (the best yet, they
promise) is due any day.

As someone who's already had the
pleasure of seeing the Blasters live, i can
guarantee that the entire crowd will be
dancing until their clothes are sweated
through. The Blasters are a group who live
to play the music they love.

"To me, the most important thing is put-
ting out good recording. But if commer-
cial means doing thing like Thoma: Dolby
or Soft Cell, l'm not going to do that,” say
Dave. "We‘re not a radio band, and we're
not MTV actors."

if you come out to Fallfcst '84 this
weekend, you are guaranteed a rockin'
good time, with the Blasters, who
epitomize a superior form of
music. . AMERICANMUSICI U
