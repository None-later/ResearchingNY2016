Unhealthy Rat

To the Editor:
if the Rathskeller is so concerned with making a proﬁt.
» why doesn’t the Rat operate at more reasonable hours
. with more competitive prices?

The Rathskelier has the advantage of convenience. but
it cannot compete with its primary competition — other
bars. Many bars feature drink specials on Monday nights
to accompany Monday Night Football and they pack peo-
ple in and operate at tremendous profits. The Rat, on the
other hand, offers no specials and closes down before
half-time. No wonder why the Rat has such a small crowd

- on Monday nights. Serious football fans, your most pro-
fitable patrons. have no option but to go elsewhere to

Weekends are the time. when most bars make their

' hugest proﬁts between 10:30 pm. and 2 a.m. What does
5 the Rathskeller do? They close on a Thursday at 12 am.
and at 11:30 pm. on Friday and Saturday, regardless if

- the place is busy or not. Until the Rat changes its policies

- and starts better serving the students’ needs by operating
at more reasonable hours. students will have to continue
to ﬁnd alternative means of entertainment.

—R0bert Kessler and quite a few students

V Right of expression

To the Editor:

After being told about a recent decision by Student
Association Executives which banned all SA funded
groups from holding “Chippendales Nights" on campus,
we would like to address a problem of growing propor-
tions at this University, the rights of freedom of
expression.

This set of rights includes the right to form' and hold
‘ beliefs and opinions on any subject and to communicate
,i this information through any medium; speech, writing,
" music or art.

We belive that in the past two years SA Executives have
denied certain SA funded groups this inherent right by
refusing to sign money vouchers to allow what they con-
sider to be "controversial" events.

The executive branch of SA is attempting to. be very
liberal in its thinking by disallowing these groups the right
to hold such events. But in their haste, to deny these
events because of the possibility that the subject matter of
the event is offensive. they are in effect being ultraconser-
vative. denying the vast majority of students the right to
participate in these events. By “vetoing” events like a
Chippendales Night or a concert by comedian John
Valby. the executive branch of SA is censoring the rights
of freedom of expression. -

When SA escapes controversy by protecting the rights
of those who do not support or do not wish to view such
an event. they have in effect discriminated against those
who feel strongly for the event.

We are not discreding the individuals who are opposed
to these events; however, we feel by allowing dissenting
views to dictate what events can or cannot be held on
campus is a violation of students' rights. For those in-
dividuals who oppose these “controversial” events there
are always the options of non-participation or
protestation.

The university system should be an open forum for all
who wish to express themselves, even those whose opi-
nions differ from our own. Obviously. the SA executive
branch has yet to realize this. _

Poor editorials

To the Editor:

i believe recent ASP editorials lack the objectivity and
substantiating facts fundamental to good journalism.

As of late, 1 have become increasingly cognizant of the
extremely pro-homosexual overtones put forth by the
ASP and a number of student organizations which claim
to represent the interests of all students. The zealous col-
laboration betwcn these groups has lead to a gross perver-
sion of our student representational system. Frankly,'i
couldn’t be the least bit concerned about issues homosex-
ual and lesbian groups support or oppose. but do expect
our representatives to begin to act on issues which are of
concern to me. For example i would like to know exactly
what is being done to increase school spirit.

As a concerned student. I am inevitably concerned that
the reputation of our ﬁne university is being maligned
through the editorial support given minority segments in
our university. such as the homosexual and lesbian sector.
The mere mention of our University’s name has become
synonymous with homo-sexual and lesbian activism, a
point of pride for few and source of shame for many. it is
time that we students restored a favorable impression of
SUNYA by proving to our friends and families that we
don’t support and will not allow minority groups to con-
tinue to dictate student policy. This is a plea for student
activism which will result in the removal from student of-
ﬁce, those who continue to ignore the student majorityl

Thoughtless vandalism

To the Editor
Have you ever tried to open a door without a
doorknob? For the disabled students on this campus, the

button on the electric door opener is our doorknob!”

When malicous and vandalistic students destroy and
remove these buttons our means of access to any building
on campus does not exist.

As a result, we are vituslly unable to independently
enter and exit these buildings. The situation is further cx-
occrbated at night, when our safety is involved, and dur-
ing winter, when our health is threatened. On behalf of
the disabled students on this campus. 1 urge all students
to take into consideration the cxhorbitant cost and un-
necessary inconvcnicncc which results from these
thoughtless acts of vandalism.

Former president of University Action for the Disabled

Black out

To the Editor:

On Saturday afternoon, Sept. 22. State Quad had a
major power failure. Not only was the quad without
power for over 2 hours, but also without water and a
working emergency generator. Throughout this power
failure. four Eastman Tower residents were stuck in an
elevator without any way of getting out.

Power Plant was called immediately, but were not.

had not been for the competency of our Resident
Assistants and the Director on duty, this emergency situa-
tion could have gotten out of hand. 111e stairwells had
few lights. if any. and walking through them was like
walking with your eyes closed. Also. if a ﬁre had broken

out, there would have been no way of getting those four '

girls out of the' elevator.

A power failure also occurcd later in the evening. after
we had been assured that everything was alright. Power
Plant was more efﬁcient this time, but only because
regqu staff - not the “weekend crew" - came out to
help. Still. the quad was without electricity for several
hours again; Even the fact that the head of the Power
Plant himself arrived on the scene did not excuse what
happened in the afternoon.

1 am not blaming anyone for this incident, but there
must be steps we can take to prevent this from'happening
again. We need a more competent weekend staff at Power
Plant because if we can not rely on them. then who are we
supposed to turn to? After all, emergencies happen on the
weekends too. .

l intend to follow up on this matter with the ad-
ministration of our school until we can ﬁnd a solution to
make sure that our residence halls can provide adequate
safety precautions for all students living on the ﬁve'
quads.

State Quad Board President

Favorable response

To the Editor:

As an active member of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance,
l agreed to coordinate GALA's participation in Group
Fair Day. in the past we have always been able to work
well with Student Association. This year was no excep-
tion. in fact, SA outdid themselves in their responsiveness
to GALA and other small groups. They are to be com-
mended for their effort. expecially the office of Patty
Salkin, Director of Programming. '

The response from the University community was also
generally favorable. The day passed almost without inci-
dent. Except for a small group of young men we presume
to be freshmen, the people visiting our table were con-
cerned and polite. To these disruptive young men we re-
mind you that you are now at a University, no longer in
high school. You may not realize it now but you are for-
tunate to be exposed to the diversity that Albany State
represents. You also reinforce the argument that GALA
is necessary to address the homophobia that still exists in
society.

As to the young man who deemed it necessary to
“moon” us, all we can say is, we have seen better.

GALA member

Free speech

To the Editor:

it would seem that leaders on this campus full to learn
the lessons of their predecessors. Two years ago, when 1
served as a University Senator, the issue of ROTC at
SUNYA earned much discussion. At that time it was
decided, by the full Senate (including several student
reps.), to allow them to remain on campus. Why then
does this year’s crop of student leaders believe that senti-
ment has changed since then (keeping in mind that it was
not a very close vote), especially since the Senate is
dominated by faculty. many of whom have heard the
debate only too often?

With repsect to the ROTC tabling in the Campus
Center, it would seem that SA is forgetting a concept
which 'has been guiding college activities for nearly two
decades. Back in 1964, something which came to be
known as the Free Speech Movement took hold at the
Univ. of California at Berkeley. it was the forebearcr ofa
student movement which swept the nation so as to allow
all members of the academic community to speak freely
on issues of concern to them. The restrictions being plac-
ed on the ROTC run contrary to all that has been fought
for over the past 20 years.

I only hope that today’s student leaders remember the
ﬁghts and controversies of yesteryear, and that they apply
what they learn from those actions to this year’s pro-
blems. in addition. i hope that our student represen-
tatives attend the conference being held at SUNY in com-
memeration of the 20th anniversary of the Free Speech
Movement on Oct. 4 and 5. Many of our professors were
involved in the actions of that period and could probably
help to illuminate my colleagues.
