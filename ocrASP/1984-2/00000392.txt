It’s the Law’

411.
possibility of ﬁghting or of work-
Ing out a plea bargain.

New, York has a "point"
system for trafﬁc tickets whereby
most trafﬁc violations are assign-
ed a certain number of points. if
found guilty. either by a plea or
after a trial. the applicable
number of points are placed on
your record. The accumulation of
a certain number of points within
an eighteen month period can
lead to revocation or suspension

of your license. The rules are too .

detailed to present fully here. but
some illustrations might be
helpful. Three speeding convic-
tions within eighteen months can
cost you your license, as could a
combination of one speeding con-
viction and three convictions for
failure to yield the right of way.
The third option is to plead not
guilty by mail. This means you
f are requesting a trial. The court
will schedule the trial and will
notify you of the date.
I If you plead not guilty. you
R " should attach a note requesting a
' “supporting deposition.” This is
a sworn statement by the ofﬁcer
who issued the ticket which pro-
vides additional detail regarding
the violation. A supporting
deposition can be helpful in

 
   
    
  

wheelchairs who had attended the
debate in the second floor
‘ Assembly Hall.

Just before he was to be carried
down the stairs, one of the
. students, T.K. Small, said
5 nothing like this had happened to

him before.

At one point Campus Center
employees were afraid someone
.\ was stuck in one of the building’s
' two elevators. A man had
j reported hearing a voice in one of
3' the two shafts, but when he was

'  asked to show where he had heard
 he walked out of the building

saying he didn't want to get

 Staff members checked the

ffgelevators and found that both

Associate Director of the Cam-
us Center Scott Birge said the
ecision to clear the building was
ade after the building super-
ivisor on duty, Mark Noe. called
him to report the outage. “The
‘ decision to evacuate was based on
 health and safety reasons." Birge
fﬁstatcd. He said estimates from

  
  

 
    
  
    
  
  
     
  

Students studying in the library
were also forced to leave that
building as a result of the elec-
’ tricity failure. “People were just
ind of annoyed because they did
have work to do,” reported
" owie Bernstein, who was study-
ing in the basement of the library.
Stevens stressed that a blackout
on State Quad two weeks ago
"was not related in any way to the
é equipment malfunction that took
.place in the lecture centers last
" ‘ uesday night. They were
nrelatcd incidences.

preparing for a trial. It is also
helpful at the trial itself. as it can
be used to discredit the officer if
they testify at trial in a manner in-
consistent with what they wrote in
the supporting deposition. The
charge will usually be dismissed if
you have properly requested a
supporting deposition and have
not received it by the time of the
trial. .

Your fourth option Is to appear
in court on the date indicated on
the ticket. if you appear you can
choose to plead guilty or not guil-
ty with the same ramifications
discussed above. You also ‘may
have another choice: plea
bargaining. This means a com-
promise is worked out with the
judge and the prosecutor. Many
judges are willing, for example, to
reduce a ﬁrst speeding ticket to a
less serious offense. This is in the
discretion of the judge; you do
not have a “right” to a plea
bargain and every court has dif-
ferent policies. Consult with an
attorney prior to appearing in
court.

if you have pled not guilty,
either by mail or in person. a trial
will be scheduled. An explanation
of trial techniques is beyond the
scope of this article. However.
several points will be mentioned.
First, you may want to hire an at-

a-Ani a tyztur-vi’V- ‘4 sgl‘:"’l '1 antics! Tucson-«3; ‘JA—A gut-g. ﬁt

"murmur 5.1m.   _

torney. to handle the trial. Par-
ticularly if you are at risk of los-
ing your license. the expense of
hiring an attorney may be
worthwhile.

Second. if you do not hire an

attorney. you must prepare for‘

the trial yourself, gather all
documents and witnesses you 'will
need. Review the facts of the case.
possibly return to the scene to
familiarize yourself with the loca-
tion. Figure out how you will res-
pond to the case presented by the
ofﬁcer.

Third. at the trial be courteous
and respectful to the judge and
the porsecution. You will have an
opportunity to question the of-
ﬁcer, but do not argue with
him/her. Present your side of the
story in a calm and clear manner.
Remember that the prosecution
has the burden of proving you
guilty. You do not have to testify.

After the trial, the judge will
decide whether you are guilty or
not guilty. You have a right to
appeal if you lose, and, if in-
terested. should consult an at-
torney regarding the procedure.
The ﬁrst step in an appeal must be
taken within thirty days of the
original decision.

One ﬁnal caution: drive safely
and obey the trafﬁc laws. These
laws are for your protection. D

sustain college and receive a '
degree at the end of the rainbow
(struggle)? Some will decide to
leave school due to their inability
to adjust to social. academic and
political injustices. Others will be
forced to leave because of
acadean dismissals or ﬁnancial
strains. There is no doubt that
many minorities leave school
because they can. no longer hold
on to the rope of social variations

. and adjustments via this universi-

ty. Others have not made the
choice to let go of the rope. but
intervening factors have cut the
rope and thus. they have fallen.

How do we endure in a univer-
sity and society when it is highly
assumed that we shall always re-
main the minority? We must
realize that “minority” does not
mean minor importance or
signiﬁcance. We have to realize
our strengths and potentials and
capitalize on them.

We have to try to progress in
the classrooms by relaying our
concepts and not silently taking
on the face of ignorance. We
must stand fast on our career
goals and realize that this univer-

sity is the total we must utilise if
we are to reach the rainbow. We
must encourage‘one another to
grasp the rope of competitiveness,
bucause after all. we are or we can
become competitors.-

We must not only learn. but
know our capabilities to their
realistic extremes. We must say
“YES. we can do itl" when socie-
ty has said “No. we can not."
We must remember the ﬁrst time
we entered this university and
realize that it was the power-of
determination, endurance and
our ’sbility to adjust that has
brought us to this height.

We can smile when we receive
our degrees knowing that we have
not only proven our academic and
spiritual equivalence to the ma-
jority. but we have proven it to
ourselves. And we must continue
the climb . . . El
