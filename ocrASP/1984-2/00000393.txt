V point of the arguments against

her were discrepancies in the
answers Johnson gave to the
questions posed by the two
committees.

On one question about the ser-

vices UAS provides, Johnson was
said to have given the EC a detail-
ed list. but told Internal Affairs
that UAS provided only food ser-
vices and a newsletter to the
campus.

In the middle of the debate. SA
President Rich Schaffer said, “I

by a panel of fourwhltes.

Johnson had several strong
supporters at the meeting, in-
cluding Schaffer and SA Vice
President Suzy AuIetta. Also
speaking on Johnson’s behalf
were several members of the
Albany State University Black
Association (ASUBA), who at-
tended the meeting.

Council member E. Paul
Stewart supported Johnson's
nomination, explaining how last
year she had successfully met per-
sonally with Norb Zahm, UAS

Midgette ended her speech by
saying. "If you'do not vote 0n
just her qualiﬁcations we will deal
with this by any means
necessary."

in Council's ﬁrst vote on
Johnson's appointment, she was
rejected 9 - 8 - 3. lacking the two-
thirds majority necessary for ap-
proval. A move to reconsider the
bill led to more debate and
resulted in a second vote,

necessary majority for apporval.

appointment had never been ap-

challenged Lozano when he said
he had already served on the elec-
tions commission.

In addition, Auletta said, she
supplied Lozano with a shortened
copy of election procedures
because there were no full copies
in the ofﬁce. but the members of
Internal Affairs whovinterviewed
him were not aware of this fact.
Because of that, Auletta said.
Lozano was asked questions he

Questions over affinnativeyw

'tion policy arose throughoutl

night, especially in, reference to
the interviewing process.
Members of internal Affairs
made it clear that they felt their
job was merely to judge the cod!-
petence of the applicants and that
afﬁrmative action was to be taken
into account only by the originil
executive committee and by Cen-
tral Council.

Schaffer disagreed, saying that
Internal Affairs “is not above af-
ﬁrmative action policy."
