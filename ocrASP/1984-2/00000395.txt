Men ’,s v soccer team loses to

By Dean Chang
SPO!” EDITOR - _

For a team that has gone winless in their
last three games. Albany State’s men's soc-
cer team has taken on the appearances of a
winner. After'Wedrtesda'y's 4-3 defeat to
Union, the top-ranked team in the state,
the. feeling is understandable.

As the eighth-ranked team in the nation,
the Dutchmen weren't expecting a tough
game from the Danes, whose record stands
at 3-4-l. If it weren’t for two critical‘
mistakes, Albany would have recorded one
of the biggest upsets of the year.

Union could thank the referees for their
second goal of the game, as the Dutchmen
were blatantly offsides according to Head
Coach Bill Schieffelin. The goal gave
Union a short-lived 2-1 advantage.

Jerry lsaacs, who got Albany’s ﬁrst goal
off a beautiful feed from Tihan Presbie,
had'a hand in the next two goals, but one
of them, was for Union.

lsaacs scored an unassisted goal to tie
the game up at two. only to commit a
crucial error half a minute later. lsaacs
tapped the ball back to goaltender Howard
Tygar. expecting Tygar to clear the bail.
To Albany’s misfortune. a Union forward
anticipated isaacs' pass and beat Tygar.

Despite that defensive lapse, lsaacs’
overall performance still stood out. Said
Schieffelin.“lerry stood out like a sore
thumb. He’s so strong and quick that very
few defenders can handle him. it’s unfor-
tunate'that he gave the ball up, because he
gave a ﬁrst-team, Ail-American perfor—
mance on the field."

Union placed a lot of pressure on of-
fense, moving their midﬁelders up to keep
the ball in the zone. Albany's strategy was

Rugby results

Albany‘s A-side rugby team (1-2)
dropped two games last week. in the
first game on Saturday September 29,
the Danes dropped a 27-12 decision to
Potsdam. '

The BI-side won their game by a convinc-

The Danes weren't helped by the injuries
to Jeff Hackett and Francisco Duane, two
experienced players that could have helped
the team. Hackett, one of the acknowledg-
ed team leaders. only played half the game
and was at 75 percent even when he was in
there.

top ranked Union

lf Albany were to play with the same en-
thusiasm and effort against all their op-
ponents, Schieffelin feels that they will win
most of their remaining games. But incon-
sistency has been a prbblem with this inex-
perienced team. and just because they
played well on Wednesday doesn't mean
that Albany will play that well next game.

“i thought we really looked good”,said
Cohen. “We played with such high intensi-
ty and i expect it to carry over to the rest of
the season."

Last Wednesday, the Danes fell to
North Adams of Massachusetts, 3-0.
Albany did not play particularly well.
Gusty winds made it difﬁcult for either
team to shoot effectively. On one goal, the
ball‘ ﬂuttered like a knuckleball with eyes,
as it avoided Tygar's arms. When
something like that occurs Tygar tries to
forget it ever happened.

“There's nothing you can do once the
game is over."said Tygar. “Having a bad
game is a ﬂuke type of thing, i hope.”

The Danes played Brockport to a 3-3 tie
on Saturday, and once again Albany
outplayed their opposition only to come
out without a victory. lsaacs scored the
first goal of the game four minutes into the
ﬁrst period, assisted by Jasmin. in the se-
cond period, Pat DaCosta scored two
goals to close out the scoring.

Albany still has a chance to make the
SUNYAC playoffs. but every conference
game is a must-win, including Saturday’s
game against Potsdam. if the Danes can
play like they did on Wednesday, they will'
be a force to be reckoned with. But the big
question for the inconsistent Danes is

Men harriers hit their stride

The Albany State men‘s cross country
team hit stride last Wednesday when the
Dane‘s trounced Hartwick 17-48 taking
1-2-3 and five of the ﬁrst six places. The
following Saturday Albany soundly
defeated Division 1 Colgate for the third
year in a row, 22-34. This past Wednesday
the very deep Dane squad shut out North
Adams State while many of the team's top
runners rested. The team has now gone
undefeated since its losses at Syracuse a
month ago and has upped its record to 5-3.

Junior Chuck Bronner won the meet for
Albany followed by Albany captians Chris
Callaci and Jim Erwin both of whom beat
out Hartwick’s ﬁrst runner. Senior Torn
Kacandes led the next Dane pack ﬁnishing
fifth overall while freshman Pat Paul
ﬁnished sixth to complete the Danes’
scoring.

The Danes had their best performance
of the last two weeks against rival Colgate
on the Red Raiders' home course last
Saturday. Colgate's Jim O‘Connor had to

place after running a strong race and cross-
ing the line in 26:41. Junior Craig Parlato .
was named runner-of-the-meet for his
outstanding fourth-place ﬁnish. Coming
off the knee injury that had kept him out
of competition for a week and a half.
Parlato ran very smart and outkicked Col-
gate's Neal Durant over the last 200 meters
to ﬁnish in 26:41.

The meet was over when freshman Tim
Hoff and Callaci ﬁnished together in 27:19
to take sixth and seventh place respective-
ly, completing the Dane's scoring.

Coach Munsey’s decision to rest most of
the team’s Colgate squad in the meet
against North Adams Wednesday gave
some of the younger Danes a chance to
shine. Sophomore John Glaser led a shut
out as he kicked past teammate Rami
Hyari in the last mile to ﬁnish in a personal
best time of 27:45. Sophomore David
Blette ﬁnished third in 28:04 closely
followed by freshman Pedro Valerio, who
was fourth in 28:07. Hyari, Blette and
Valerio all ran personal best times. Senior
Jim McGinty finished ﬁfth for Albany and
ﬁfth overall to complete the Danes ﬁrst
shutout of the season.

Tomorrow the team travels to New
Jersey for a three-way dual meet against
host Trenton State, Montclair State and
Queens College. D

still might not be able to answer after

PAWPRINTS: To add to Albany’s woes,
their premier defensive tackle John Red-
mond is doubtful for tomorrow's game
after suffering an injury that forced him to
miss the final quarter of the Springﬁeld
game... Kick returner and halfback
Rogelio Mitchell also will miss tomorrow’s
game because of an injury.

held at Albany last weekend(September
28-29) is any indication of how they'll do
In next weekend's (October l2) SUNYAC
tournament in Rochester then it looks like
they'll win for the sixth consecutive year.
The Danes took the ECAC tournament
and themselves, by surprise, tying for third
outOof 24 teams. The results had St. John's
taking ﬁrst, followed by the University of

Rochester and Albany and

Millersvilie(Pa.) tying for third.

due to the format of the tournament.
Albany's strength is their balance and
overall depth, yet this tournament had on-
ly the number one and two singles and only
two doubles teams playing. Team Captain
Jay Eisenberg said. “it was a great team
tournament. We ﬁnished third, something
to be proud of. The competition was really
great.”

The best performance for the Danes was
by Tom Schmitz at second singles.
Schmitz, seeded sixth, made it to the
semiﬁnals by defeating Kraus from
Niagara 6-0, 6-0 and St. John Fisher's
D'Amato 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 then Hinton of

Wesleyan College 6-1, (5-1. He lost to the
eventual winner of the tournament. Mlke
Vortsman, an excellent player from St.
John’s, where he played number one last
year. Vortsman. seeded first in the touma-
ment. took Schmitz 6-2, '6-3.

The biggest surprise of the tournament
was in number one doubles playIThe Jay
Eisenberg-Mike Dermansky duo. who
haven’t been playing well together as a
double‘s team, also reached the semifinals.
Dermansky said. “For me and lay it was a
really good tournament. We hadn't been
playing that well. We went all out, hit as
hard as we could and things worked out."
in the ﬁrst round, Albany’s combo beat
the ﬁfth-seeded duo from Gannon, 6-l,
6-1. They moved on to upset the University
of Vermont, 64, 3-6, 6-2 and then Univer-
sity of Massachusetts, 7-5, 6-2. in
semiﬁnal play they lost 6-1, 6-l~ to Bates
College. the eventual champions.
Eisenberg said, “It was a good string of
wins. We played really good tennis all
weekend."

Dave Grossman, Albany's number one
singles player was seeded sixth for the
tournament.He beat Bates College’s
Luyrink, 6-4, 6-4, advancing to the second
round. Against Guilmain of St. Michaels,
Grossman won, 6-3, 6-3 to move on to the
quarterﬁnals. University of Vermont's

The Mitch Gerber and Dave Zobler ‘
doubles team won their ﬁrst round by
default. In the second round they played
third seeded St. John's. Gerber and Zobler
' took the ﬁrst set. 6-3 and were ahead 5-3‘in
the second. As Zobler commented, “We
were playing well. It looked like we'd take
it." The turning point of the match came
when St. John's broke Gerber’s serve at »
5-3. "Both of our games went downhill
from there," said Zobler. St. John's wen
on to take the match 3-6. 7-5, 6-0. Zobler
said, "We really both thought we had the
match and before we knew it we lost."

St'. John's finished with so points for '
ﬁrst. University of Rochester had I! and
Albany and Millersvllle. llapiece. New
Hampshire and Bates College tied for ﬁfth
with 12 points and Tufts and University of

seventh.

“The overall performance of the team
was excellent," said Bob Lewis, “I’m very
pleased with our third-place ﬁnish. i didn’t
expect to ﬁnish that high. This team is
playing up to their capabilities. When you
ﬁnish higher than expected you know the
guys are playing well." ‘

Yun shut out Kathy Loomis, 6-0, 6-0. in
the ﬁfth singles match, Nancy Forbes shut
out Mary Helen Russo, 6-0, 6-0 and Nina
Cheung took Dawn Prineau, 6-l, 6—0 to
complete an awesome Albany singles
sweep. ‘

The doubles matches held nothing for
St. Rose as they were swept again. Dane
duo Tischler and Chiodo thrashed Seras
and Boehning, 6-l. 6—0 while Yun and
Forbes took Delzio and Prineau, 6-0, 6-l
in something less than a thriller. Cheung
and Lisa Bahrami beat Loomis and Russo
for Albany's ninth consecutive win.
Although this display of Dane domination
was “good psychological experience” in

the words of Coach Serbalik, it must be
noted of the dire straits that have plagued
the tennis program at St. Rose.

On the other side of the coin is Vermont,
a team that is Division l. a team that is well
organized, and a team that beat Albany
8-]. in ﬁrst singles action, Deb Leffe con-
tinued her winning ways by taking Sue
Stein. 6-2, 7-5. Things went downhill from
there. Sue Lewis easily handled Gerri
Chiodo, 6-l, 6-l. Kathy Dunfee romped
Helene Tischler, 6-l, 6-0 and Marla
Pichon beat Ellen Yun, 6-l, 6—0 to put
Albany in a hole they would never climb
out of. The singles troubles continued as

EGBEAT DANE TRANSCRIPT

Carolyn Brain handled Nancy Forbes. 6-1,
6-0 and Mia Graham won a three-set battle
with Lisa Valens, l-6, 7-5, 7-6.

Vermont continued to show why they
are Division 1 by sweeping the doubles
tourney. Dunfee and Goldsmith edged
Tischler and Chiodo. 6-l, 3-6, 7-6 in a
hard fought net war. Lewis and Brain shut
down Yun and Forbes, 6-l, 6-0 while
Pichon and Graham stopped Cheung and
Bahrami, 6-2. 6-3 for an 8-] Vermont vic-
tory and Albany's second loss of the
season.

Ellen Yun played extremely well and
fought hard before dropping her match to

‘Kerry O'Brien, 4-6. 6-0, 7-6. Nancy
:Forbes, playing well above her caliber,
dropped a tough decision to Natalie Grim,
16-0, 3-6. 6-2. Lisa‘ Valcns and Nina Cheung
also played very well despite dropping
their matches to Dina Rciling (6-1, 6-4)
and Jaclyn Cray (6-2, 6-2). respectively.

Trouble continued in doubles as Parker
and Reiling took Leffe-Chiodo, 8-3, Yun-
Forbes fell to O'Brien-Grim, 10-6, and
gohnson-Cury thrashed Valens-Chcung,

-i.

Head Coach Serbalik felt good about
the match. “We deﬁnitely played way
above our heads considering the condi-
tions," said Serbalik. “With a full squad,
we might have beaten them. With a
healthy squad, we have great depth."

The record stands at 4-3, the squad '
stands thin, and Coach Serbalik stands
pat. The road ahead looks to get rougher
than the road taken.
