Faced with student housing
problems, the need to entice
businesses back to Albany. and
fears of declining neighborhoods,
, . city officials have turned to
l», 1 , several people including SUNYA
m g I professor Todd Swanstrom and
t “I University President Vincent
m; O’Leary for help.

Swanstrom is the staff director
of a committee which is develop-
ing a strategic plan for Albany,
with a goal of helping to ease the
city into l990.

Governments need strategic
planning. according to
SWanstrom, because they tend to
operate by crisis management,
meaning the focus on the pro-
blems of the moment rather than
on long-range goals.

The $75,000 project, co-
“ “ sponsered by the city and
e 5'» SUNYA's Rockerfeiler institute
of Government, includes a com-
mittee of 42 members of the
Albany community ranging in the'
ﬁelds from business to govern-

Swanstrom said.

The task force on housing and
community development has been
studying the issue of student
housing, Swanstrom said. One of
the problems with housing in
Albany. he explained, is that
families are being priced out of
the market by students. Three or
four students can afford to pay

150 each to cover monthlky

costs, but a woman with two
children may not be able to afford
the same rent, he asserted.

Permanent residents of the
Pine Hills area, where many
students live, are worried that
their neighborhood may be “go-
ing down", Swanstrom said.

“We're in communication with

people at the University and the
city--looking for a long-term way
of dealing with the problem. Both
entities will have to do
something", he said. One solu-
tion that has been discussed,
Swanstrom noted, is the building
of more dormitories.

The committee, which has been
meeting since March, will submit
its ﬁnal report to Mayor Thomas
M. Whalen iii in January,
Swanstrom said. The committee's
recommendations are advisory
and non-binding, he noted.

“l'm confident that the Mayor
won’t just put (the ﬁnal report)
on the shelf", Swanstrom
asserted, citing two reasons. First
42 prominent citizens are taking
pan in formulating the‘ ﬁnal
report and secondly, it deals only
with facts, Swantrom said. it will
“only recommend things possible
within existing trends", explained
Swanstrom.

Library" check-cuts to get faster

By Robin Katz

Students can now check-out the
books they need from the Univer-
sity library, supermarket-style.

A “barcode,” similar to UPC
symbols, will be placed on all stu-
dent l.D. cards as part of the
library's effort to switch to a new
computer system which will
enable quicker check-outs and
better access to library resources,
according to Library Director
Josephy Z. Nitecki.

The system, which the library is
paying $462,000 for. will use
"light wands" or sensors to read
the codes off the back of a stu-
dent's l.D. and the book being
charged out. Nitecki said the
money is being taken from both
university and library equipment
budgets.

Nitecki said the new system will
‘be completely in place by the end

of this semester. “Over one
million physical items are in the
library and they need to have bar-
codes placed in them," before the
system can be fully implemented,
he said.

“Each l.D. sticker, (known as)
the barcode, is like a price label in
a' supermarker," Nitecki said.
Barcodes will also be placed on
the books. The l.D. code will be
read by the computer and match-
ed to the code of the book being

Students must repay entire 310 if ID ls lost or stolen

Lost your bus sticker? Tough luck.

Students who purchased $10-a-semester bus fee
stickers will not be given a free replacement if the
ﬁrst one is lost or stolen, according to Megan Bidel,
Assistant to the Director of the Physical Plant.

Association and administration ofﬁcials is that
some students might take advantage of the system
by peeling off the sticker, giving or selling it to
another student, and then replacing it, free of

the way a price of a good is read
by a computer in a market and
matched to the bill," he
explained.

“The new system will speed up
checking out books," said Carol
Anderson, assistant director of
access services, adding, “More
statistical information about
library books will be available.
Data about location of books will
be accessible more quickly.
Automatic blocking devices will
bar students with overdue books
from taking out additional ones.
We can get the books back
quicker with this method."

“New l.D.s are being labeled
but the old ones need the bar
codes as well," Anderson explain-
ed. When checking out books,
students with old l.D. cards are
ﬁlling out registration forms to
receive their barcodes. she added.

“48,000 l.D. cards and I5,000
books have been coded already.
We have to code more before the
system can be effective," Ander-
son said.

“We won't wait till bar codes
are placed in all the books to
begin," Nitecki said. During the
transition period the system will
work more slowly than it will

Nitecki said. “The user will

Many students have already reported that their
bus stickers were stolen, were lost with their l.D.
cards, or simply fell off.

Senior Madeline Caiiendo claimed her l.D. card
and its attached bus sticker were stolen at Satur-
day's Larkfest. When she went to get a replacement
sticker at the Motor Pool, they told her she would
have to purchase another.

"i thought i didn’t have to pay for a replacement
since they have my name on a general list. i was
very angry about the fact that i had to pay $10, as
well as the principle of the thing," she said.

Paula Weiss, a graduate student who lost her
l.D. card and has to pay for a new sticker, said she

sition has ended though,” Nitecki
explained.

A system similar to SUNYA's
new system is already in place at
several other SUNY's, Anderson
said. “it has already been install-
ed in Purchase and at Buffalo.
Binghamton is in the midst of in-
stalling it." She added that
Stonybrook has the system, but
has not yet made a firm
commitment.

SUNYA started a task force
three years ago to search for a
new automated system, according
to Anderson.

Nitecki explained, “All groups,
including library faculty and
technical experts, consulted and
decided that this new system was
feasible. Students were consulted,
as well, to get their feedback
about the plan."

Nitecki noted the possible
future benefits of the system, say-
ing “We have our own computer
system now. in the near
future . . . students might even
have catalogs on computer ter-
minals in their dorm rooms. Card
catalogs might become com-
puterized on the new computer."

“These plans are in the future
but in the long range," he said,

research is advancing maybe not

Disabled students have been
ﬁnding their electric door knobs
missing and pizza trucks in their
parking spaces: as a result Stu-
dent Association officials have
cracked down on vandals, and il-
legal parkers.

University Action for the
Disabled, (UAD), along with SA,
have developed a plan to combat
the problem.

To kick off this awareness cam-
paign. Central Council
unanimously passed a resolution
Wednesday night denouncing all
vandalism to special equipment
and the abuse of disabled parking
spots and supporting “full
punishment for such offenders."
The resolution was introduced by
SA President Rich Schaffer and
other SA officials.

The ﬁve part plan. which was
developed by UAD member San-
dra Lamb and Schaffer, was an-
nounced during UAD‘s interest
meeting Monday and calls for the
support of all SA ofﬁcials and
group leaders.

Lamb and Schaffer’s awareness
campaign inclure letters ,being
sent to the editors of the Albany
Student Press, The Student
Voice, and all SA group leaders.

In addition, UAD will sponsor
awareness workshops with SA
groups. SA will also demand
greater enforcement of disabled
parking regulations.

To combat the parking pro-
blem, UAD will stan its own
ticketing campaign. placing
notices on illegally parked cars in-
forming the drivers of the law.

According to UAD Vice-

President Robert Pipia, a New
York State law permits a $40 ﬁne
to be levied against cars illegally
parked in disabled parking spots.
According to a source in public
safety, however, the ﬁne would

only be $5. consisthnt'with all on-
eampus parking fines.‘

SA plans to remind local as

companies and deliverers
that puking in disabled spots is ll-
lesel. Schaffer said. "if they will
not abide by university regula-
tions, we don't want their
business on our campus.” he ex-
plained. adding that SA will seek
the support of Public Safety and
the university in enforcing the
law.

“We're not going to stand for
any of this," said Schaffer, who
said he had been unaware of the
severity of the vandalism until ap-
proached by Lamb. According to
Schaffer, all publicity of the
situation will reinforce the fact
that vandalism can't be tolerated
on this campus. “Vandalism
shouldn’t even be an issue," he
added.

According to Lamb, recent
destruction of equipment has in-
cluded the breaking of the special
plexi-glass information board on
the side of the information desk
in the Campus Center.

The information board had
been speciﬁcally constructed at
the request of UAD in order that
students in wheelchairs wouzri be
able to see memos usually kept on
top the the information desk.

Twenty~six electric door
openers and disabled telephones
have also been damaged, explain-
ed Lamb. who added that that
plant department is planning to
install more electric doors on
campus. “Cost is a big factor in
repairing the equipment." Lamb
said, adding that it takes a lot of
time, to order replacement parts
and complete the repairs.

"UAD and the (Physical) plant
are working very closely to get
these things repaired," said Den-
nis Stevens, Director of -the
Physical Plant. Stevens estimated
