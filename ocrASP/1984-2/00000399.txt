course "essesitiaiiy designed to teach

students the anthropological approach to

the study of culture and how this approach
is relevant to the professions".

Several anthropology students taking
the course. which currently has an enroll-
ment of more than 430 students split up
between two classes. said they resent the
new emphasis of the couse.

"lt seems like you can't escape from the
Business majors in this school::. said one
Anthropology major taking the course.
“i’m taking this course as a requirement
for my major. its insulting to be told its be-
ing geared toward business majors. if I
take a business course they're not going to

offer a more humanistic approach just for
anthro majors—this is unfair". she added.

Furst acknowledged that this may be a
problem. but added that there are not
many anthropology majors currently tak-
ing the course. which is a requirement for
the anthropology major. "You do
sacriﬁce a little", Furst sid. "but they (an-
thropology majors) can make it up in other
courses".

The proposal to include ANT 200 was a
choice for the pre-Business social science
requirement originated in the An-
thropology Department. The department's
Chair, Dr. Gary Gossen. explained, “We
wanted to expose students to an-
thropology. Many people think of it as a
weird subject dealing primarily with peo-
ple in grass skirts".

The readings and the lectures in the

course have been changed somewhat.
Furst said. Traditionally. Cultural An-
thropology courses examine ethnographies

of different cultures. past and present.

The revised course. Furst said, will focus
primarily on "how different people solve

common problems relevant to our own
technological society”.Fo‘r example,
several lectures will address drinking and
violence. Furst said. noting that in some
cultures drinking does not lead to violence.
According to Nancy Bond. Associate
Dean of the School of Business. the addi-
tion of Cultural Anthropology as a pre-
buslness option is “tatally appropriate".
She said she has many articles in business
journal addressing "Corporate Culture".
Anthropology said Bond “is an in-
teresting way to study dynamics as they oc-
cur in the business world".
including Cultural Anthropology. there
are now three courses which ﬁll the pre-
business social sciences requirement. The
other two are Psychology l0lM and
Sociology il5M. Prospective Business ma-
jors are required to take two of these three
courses.

Anthropology 200 also fulﬁlls the
World Cultures requirement of the
General Education Program. Students can
choose to take the course as a “writing in-
tensive" to fulﬁll that requirement as well.

According to Bond the Cultural An-
thropology course is an important
demonstration of the way departments in
the university can work together. Develop-

Bond noted that business students an.-
"highly intelligent and motivated people
who sometimes tend to be a bit parochial
in their viewpoints." Cultural an.
thropology, she said. should "help
students to adjust to the wide variety or
people they will deal with in the business
world." She described the course as “an

business program."

Your fingers can now do the
walking to campus events.
451-0079. the new Activities Hot
Line, will tell you in 90 seconds or
less what's happening on campus.

The Activities Hot Line is a
tape machine connected to a
phone on which the upcoming
events_ of Student Association
groups will be announced. accor-
ding to SA's Director of Student
Programming Patty Salkin.

“People don't have to read
through advertisements because
the Activities Hot Line will enable
students to listen for upcoming

events." said Salkin.

SA Vice President Suzy Auletta
who made the Activites Hot Line
one of her campaign promises last

spring. said “it's a direct link to

find out what’s going on,

especially for off-campus

'students who are not constantly

banged by posters on the
'um.‘

"l'm sure that once people
catch on and memorized the
number it's become like informa-
tion — 8390. everybody knows
that." she added. -

The tape will run from

IThursdays at 5 pm. until 9 am.
,Fridays and again of Fridays at 5
:p.m. until 9 a.m. Mondays.
Depending on the amount of in-
formation to be announced. the
tapes will run from 30 to 90

seconds. "It will be up to my
discretion to edit the requests."
said Salkin. Only essential infor-
mation will be played and it will
be on a first come. first serve
basis. she added. .
The tapes will run on 11'iursday

nights since. according to Salkin. ‘

"Nathaniel Charney and .

adding, "different people will be‘

People interested in volunteer- ‘

ofﬁce.

“The machine and tapes came

allocated the money to my fund,"
explained Salkin.

Statistics on the system's use
will eventually be compiled.
f‘After the ﬁrst month we will
probably poll an SA funded

out how they found out about the
event."

“Hopefully. people will give us
feedback on it.” added Salkin.

"Suzy and i feel it was an inex-

communication between SA and
students as a whole." Salkin said.

“i think it's extremely
beneﬁcial to students and will
promote school spirit on cam-
