niVersity vote

- the Editor
This is my third year attending SUNY-Albany and I am
ding it increasingly difﬁcult to put any faith in the

licies supported by this University.

i am not a member and have absolutely no association
in ROTC. The discrimination against this vital instru-
nt in the protection of the greatest country on Eanh as
e consequence of supporting the "useless Gay and Les-
an Alliance has me fuming.
The minority of students who are making University
slons do not in any way reﬂect the views of the stu-
nt majority. For reasons of national defense. student
eferencc. and especially. morality, the support of
ALA at the expense of ROTC is a farce. We are sacriﬁc-
g an opportunity to provide our military with qualiﬁed
rsonnel to protect our nation. And i ask you. for what

ll? .
The policies of this University conﬂict with the laws
d policies of our government. it has been determined

. our Judicial System that discrimination against_

moscxuals is not a violation of the law. Moreover. the

mmission of homosexual acts IS against the law.

So by the stand of the University on the subjects of
OTC and GALA we are. in effect, saying we are exempt
cm the laws of our country, and we can do Whatever we
ish.

I propose a University-wide, highly publicized, vote be

kcn on these matters as soon as possible. The whole of

e student body should decide who we want to support
d go to school with. the United States military or the

ays. Lets get back to the American way.

An’ apology — m“

To the Editor: . -

The debate over whether Laura Johnson should have
been approved as a UAS Board member (Central Coun-
cil. Oct. 3. I984) ignored several points that, in my opi-
nion, would have led to her approval. These points are
critical of the lntemal Affairs committee in that it failed
to:

Dunderstand how cultural differences between inter-
viewers and interviewee may impede the establishment of
mutual trust

Dshow ﬂexibility in accepting the viewpoints of other
individuals and groups

Dacknowlcdge that there may have been outside fac-
tors inﬂuencing the interview proccss. such as radio
bllasting in the hall (not the best example, but the point is
c car).

I am convinced that we were an embarrassment to this
University and ourselves to allow the “pigheadcdncss” of
Internal Affairs and oversensitivity of ASUBA, et. al.
push us into a corner where our objectivity became null.
We were seeing things in black and white where there was
a lot of gray area. By God, Rich and Suzy had more
Negro blood in them that night than I did!

In the future. if we are to uphold our stated reputation
as fair, open-minded individuals, let us view the facts and
the facts alone. Clearly, our convictions clouded our
judgement and we lost sight of our objective. As a result,
a competent young lady became the victim of ignorance.

Laura Johnson, on behalf of Central Council. I
apologize.

—Joe Jackson
Central Council Representative

Critical issues

To the Editor:

With only one month till the election, and with so many
critical issues, either pertaining directly to the nation or to
our own university which the Editorial Board of the ASP-
could have written about, the editorial which they did
publish in Friday's paper was just a shame. It was called
“Editorials”, and consited 0f the word "editorial"
repeated two-hundred and four times, and nothing more.

If an editorial board has any purpose, it is to focus and
sustain the discussion or issues. Friday's editorial was
pointless, is the board as well?

—Richard Lerner

Student debate

To the Editor

4 more years? 4 more weeks. Hey hey. he's no good.
send him back to Hollywood. California is a nice place to
retire. We have heard all of the slogans.

This Sunday, October 14, Channel 6 WRGB will be air-
ing a debate held between the SUNYA students for Mon-
dale vs. students for Reagan. At 12:00 noon, grab your
coffee and tune in.

Voting November 6 is essential for the future. An in-
formed choice is not only an obligation but our respon-
sibility — it is our future.

—Ellzabeth A.G. Harris

Different methods

To the Editor:

Last night 1 attended the orientation for the “Don't
Walk Alone" escort service. One of the many speakers
was Japhct Zwana. the Associate Director of Afﬁrmative
Action. He began his talk by telling us that in Zimbabwe
(where he is from) “male superiority is not an idea. it is a
reality." He explained that he was not there to speak
from that point of view. Since coming to America, he
said. he has learned to have "restraint."

He asked someone in the audience for a deﬁnition of
sexual harassment. The woman described sexual harass-
ment as a man or woman putting sexual pressure on so-
meone as a term of employment, etc. Mr. Zwana
responded by asking, “is that so bad?” He then informed
the mostly female audience that “men have to work hard
to get sex . . . I mean. he doesn't Just say ‘lct's have sex’
and the lies down." This got a laugh from the audience.

He went on to tell us that a lot of men and women have
questions about sexual harassment. Hls‘ example was:
“Can i say hello to a girl in a bar? Does that constitute
sexual harassment?" Docs Mr. Zwana honestly believe
anyone in the room would consider that sexual
harassment? '

He then asked, "It sexual harassment is problem? Can

gotten

To'the Editor:

Many students on campus do not understatﬁ effort U I

involved in opening a door, do you? How m I ‘students
take for granted the fact that they can reach th 16p of the
info desk to ask a question? How much cf fort H it take
to leave a dorm during a ﬁre drill, only to ﬁnd'dut it was
pulled by one of your fellow students? ‘ f

These questions and others should be asked by each
:ludent on campus of him/her self. The answers will
:lemonslratc to you exactly the lack of awareness that ex-
:sts on this campus of the problems which face our fellow
students who are disabled. As your student represen-
tatives. we are alarmed at the increasing amount of van-
dalism to projects on campus designed to assist disabled
students.

Over the past two weeks, we have heard of the destruc-
tion done to the new plexiglas on the information desk.
This new addition allowed those in wheelchairs to have
information more accessible to them. Stories have ﬁltered
into our ofﬁce explaining the broken door knobs on our
new mechanical doors. A disabled student cut her hand

on the jagged metal from the broken circular piece. It I»

took many years to win approval for that necessary pro—
ject, thanks to Dennis Stevens and now some uncaring
students must prove his/her stupidity.

Many cab drivers and pizza delivery people pull up and
park in designated handicapped parking spots, without
thinking. Un fortunately some mindless wonders feel they
are above all regulations. The spots were designed to
allow specially equipped vehicles easy access to our
University. The dfeaded false alarm in the middle of the
night must be the most vicious act. Think of thE fear run-
ning through a disabled student’s mind when that alarm
rings with its piercing sound. The only question has to be,
“is it a real ﬁre and will I make it?" Think about it!

We are calling on all students to help us ﬁght this horri-
ble problem. Student Association, along with University
Action for the Disabled is developing an awareness cam-
paign to educate our fellow students. Please think before
you commit a stupid act of vandalism. Report all pro-
blems to your dorm director or R.A., especially with the
mechanical doors. Discouragc your friends or neighbors
from displaying their lack of intelligence upon their
decision to damage a door or wheelchair ramp. "

it is important for each student to prevent this unneed-
cd vandalism. It is both inconvenient and costly to our
fellow students. It can disrupt a student's daily life.
something which many of us'take very lightly. We are
looking for people to help us with this campaign. Drop by
SA and offer your ideas. This, we think, is one campaign
where everybody can be on the winning side.
