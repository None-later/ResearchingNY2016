‘ - to become whole human-beings in

By Patrlcoilonaon

As we journey through life. we _

will encounter many facets of op-
pression and discrimination.
Throughout our history. we have
silenced our thoughts and in-
stincts if they opposed society's
patterns of behavior and thought.

Beyond

the

Majority

We have allowed our true iden-'
tities and beliefs to sleep, in fear
of rebelling against the mm, the
rules, And now that we have

awakened. we need our Inner
strengths and drives in our fight

.a  where we have not
lwrecieved just recognition.

in our many struggles, oft
our path are blocked and we may
become weary. Here is a message

I which serves as a reminder from ‘
where we have come; to take us

through the storms; and to lead us

.to becoming our true selves:

I have seen you at your lowest
When you had a voice.

But no. one considered you
significant enough to listen to
The times you gave it all.
And had none reciprocated
When you cried.

And no one would dry your
tears
And although you were hurting,
Somehow you managed a smile
And you kept smiling, until your
cheeks ached in pretense,
But society has taught you to
master the skill i have seen you
When society was molding you.
until you were made
And taught you to be passive,
when we knew of your

aggression ,
How they painted your face un-

til no one could see the real you, .

i have seen you given dolls, and -

cook books. and conventional

Until you have become, the
socialized “Miss America"

i have seen you mentally and
physically bruised and.
battered.

Until, I also, have felt your pain
i have heard your whispers,
When you wanted to shout
And have watched you publicly

'“PPOI'l. '
When you privately wanted to
condemn

And when you have followed all

traditional patterns,

Afraid to rebel or non—conform,

and be labeled
And if one of us refused to
conform,

Society has taught you to frown.
while I knew deep within, you
envied
But now I see you

No longer afraid to say no. and

You are exploring various fields,
So that you can make your own

You are exploring life's forests.
So that you can find your own

way
i see you releasing your gifts to
inventiveness
And now you are making your
own codes and patterns
You have not chosen to become
a sole follower of tradition
I hear you
Speaking and being heard
You are no longer someone
else's property or possession,
But you are a slave solely to
your inner beliefs and voice
i see you
Resisting the webs of the old
society,
And instead, you are capturing

Capturing all the freedoms the

America has promised us,
But simultaneously has denied us
And although you have been

You lived on
Although you have been
knocked.

You have not fallen
Although you have been left
alone in the cold and darkness.
You have created your own light
And although you have been
stereotyped,

You still held on to your identity
Although you have been
intimidated
You are now intimidating
As you unmask yourself. unviel

You release a woman
A woman ready to win and to

After knowing defeat and the
power of losing too long
Yes, i can see you.

in SA's fight for another on-
campus polling place at SUNYA.
Currently State Quad has a poll-
ing place on the quad, and lndian
Quad and those dorms on Dutch
which lie in the town of
Guilderiand can vote at the Phys.
Ed. Building.

According to Sue Wray, presi-
dent of 'the Student Association
of the State University, (SASU),
the decision means “we (students)
are no longer second-class
citizens.” SASU, she said. was in-
strumental in pressing the litiga-
tion. in cooperation with
SUNYA’s SA and the New York
Public interest Research Group
(NYPiRG).

An important aspect of the
decision, said Schaffer, is that
although Auerbach vs. McKinley
initially applied only to SUNYA
students, the decision now applies
to all students in New York State
at all colleges and universities, not
just SUNY schools.

According to Wray, SASU had
to sue “ecunty by county . . . it's
been tremendously time consum-
ing.” 'which explained the delay
of over three". ears in the decision.
SASU initial facilitated litiga-
tion against boards of election
which discriminated against
students in l98l..

The decision, Wray said, shows
that “students are full-class,
responsible citizens and deserve
the same rights as non-students.”

According to SASU. New York
has become the fortyminth state
to grant students voting rights.
“Only Alaska continues this
discriminatory practice," said
Wray. adding. "you can‘be sure
we'll be calling Alaska."

ntll the results of SA's lawsuit are in.

SA Vice President Suzy Auletta said that
‘we haven’t taken any formal action (on
he no-replacement policy) yet. We have
at discussed an alternative to the policy
ince it just started becoming an issue last
eek." She said SA plans to discuss it
‘soon."

Auletta said she opposes the current
oiicy. “it‘s ridiculous for a person to pay
wice fdr a bus sticker. Once is enough.
- ctually, onceis more than enough. Twice

' s ridiculous," she asserted.

Personally, Auletta said she feels that in
he event of a lost sticker, the name of the
erson who bought the sticker should be
hecked. and then a new sticker should be

put on the l.D. card. “There shouldn't be
any problem," she said.

This week, Auletta said she has seen
l.D. .cards where “it was very apparent
that the bus sticker once was there." Many
of these students. she said, will have to pay
for stolen stickers, a policy she called
unfair.

Although students housed in Alumni
Quad and the Wellington Hotel received
their bus stickers at no charge, they too
would have to pay for a replacement.

When asked if any changes are being
considered for the administration's policy.
Bidel said, “Not that i know of."

Caiiendo concurred. saying. “i doubt
i'll get my ten dollars back, or any
satisfaction." [3

Tentative deadline set for 'grouper law'

ant who asked not to be identified.

According to surveys taken by Karlson's
ffice over the past two years. the average
iii-campus student paid $l25 a month,
ncluding heat and utilities.

Students in the apartments under in-
estigation said Buckman did not inform
hem of the gronpcr law ordinance before
hcy rented the house.

Buckman has a record of complaints
'igainst him on file with the SUNYA Stu-
dcnl Association's Off-Campus Housing
Office. Complaints range from problems
with heating houses to looks in bedroom

' ceilings.

Two of the bedrooms in one apartment
“could be closets," according to the
students living there. They added that only
two out of the five bedrooms in that apart-
ment contain built-in closets.

SA Attorney Mark Mishler said he
“would not classify him (liuckman) us one
of the worst" landlords in Albany.

There probably are more houses. like
the one near Quail Street, that contain 14
or more students, said Mishler, explaining.
“landlords are out to make money."

Mishler, Kurlson and Alvaro all recom-
mended that students faced with an insch-
lion of their apartment or house should
cooperate with the Code Enforcement
iiurcau officials.

Alvaro reported several incidents of
students resisting inspections, and one case
where “students ‘sikkcd' a dog on an in-
spector" who came to their door.

Mishler said students should not view
the inspectors as “enemies.” and that,
“assuming the students have nothing to
hide," they should “show the inspecto
around and point out problems." [J
