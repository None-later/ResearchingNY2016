“lot no help you with the dif-
ference. Mrs. Ferraro. between
Iran and the embassy in
Lebanon." .

“. . .l almost resent. Vice
President Bush. your patronizing
attitude that you have to teach me
about foreign policy." she
snapped.

“. . . Secondly, please don't
categorize my answers either.
Leave the interpretation of my
answers to the American people
who are watching this debate.

Bush said terrorism is “very,
very difﬁcult to stop and l think
everybody knows that.” He laud-
ed President Reagan for accepting
the blame for the bombing of
U.S. installations in Beirut. "But
i think fair-minded people that
really understand international
terrorism know that it is really
hard to guard against."

But Ms. Ferraro asserted the

t administration should have done

. more to guard the embassy. “Are
we going to take the proper
precautions before we put
Americans in situations where
they are going to be in danger or
are we just going to walk away
and throw our arms
up . . . When is the president go-
ing to take some action?"

Bush accused Ferraro of saying
-thc Marines killed in Lebanon
died in shame, but she shot back:
“No one has ever said those killed
' through the negligence of this ad-
ministration dicd in shame."

Ferraro attacked Reagan's ver-
sion of prosperity as well, saying,
“Things are not as great as the
administration is wanting us to
believe in their television commer-
cials." She added that housing
mortgage rates are 14.5 percent.
that 6 million people are below
the poverty level and that 500,000
people have been taken off
disability rolls.

Bush said, President Reagan
“has turned this country
around." He said the administra-
tion of Jimmy Caner that Reagan
defeated in 1980 “delivered 21.5
percent interest rates. They
delivered what they called
malaise. They delivered interest
rates that were right off the
charts.”

Ferraro also accused the ad-
ministration of failing to take a
strong stand on civil rights,
noting atthe same time that she
and her ,running mate Walter
Mondale oppose quotas to
achieve racial equality.

Bush responded by criticizing
I Mondale for “saying everything
is bad. If somebody sees a silver
lining. he sees a black cloud out
. there. Whine on, harvest moon."

Bush also strongly rebuked Fer-
raro's pro-choice abortion stand.
saying “there's been 15 million
I abortions since 1973 and i don't
take that lightly." He said he sup-
‘ ported Reagan's position on
~ abortion and. like Reagan, favors
a “human rights amendment" to
' the Constitution.

He also denied that the ad-
ministration's support of volun-
tary prayer in the schools was a
merging of church and state.

Ferraro argued that the intru-
sion of religion into politics
started in 1980 when Rev. Jerry
Falwell became involved in
Reagan's presidential campaign.

On abortion. Ferraro. a
Catholic. said she could not im-
pose her religious views on others.
“If there comes a time where i
cannot practice my religion and

 

 

.

‘ do my job properly. I will resign
my job." she said. El

 

 

State. law

    

By Mark Mlahlor
Contrary to popular belief.
tenants in Albany are not totally
at the mercy of their landlords. If
the condition of your apartment
is not quite what you
expected. you may It's
have certain legal
rights and remedies. tn

The most impor-
tant law in New York Law
State for tenants is
the “warrant of habitability" law
enacted in 1975 to protect tenants
from unsafe or dangerous condi-
tions in apartments. A “warran-
ty” is a promise. This law pro-
vides that every agreement for the
rental of residential premises is
deemed to contain a promise by
the landlord that the premises are
habitable and contain no condi-
tions which are dangerous. hazar-
dous or detrimental to the te-
nant's life. health or safety. Both
written and oral leases are
covered by this implied warranty
of habitability.

The wording of this law -

dangerous. hazardous or
detrimental to life. health or safe-
ty - is purposefully broad. includ-
ed within its scope are problems
such as inadequate heat. poor
ventilation, defective plumbing.
insect or rodent infestation. poor
security and ceiling leaks. in fact.
any problem relating to health or
safety comes under this law.

One limitation does apply to
the protections afforded by the
warranty of habitability law. If
the unsafe condition was caused
by misconduct of the tenant or
persons under the tenant's con-
trol then the landlord is not held
responsible. Many situations exist
where it is not clear whether the
condition was caused. at least in
part. by the tenants. If such a
question arises, the ﬁnal decision
would be made by the judge hear-
ing the case. While the law pro-

vides an exception for conditions

caused by the tenant's miscon-
duct. there is no requirement that
the condition be caused by the
landlord's misconduct in order to
come within the scope of the law.
Only two factors are required for
the law to apply: (1) a condition
exists which may be dangerous.
hazardous or detrimental to life.
health or safety and (2) the condi-
tion was not caused by the
tenants.

Assuming the existence of a
condition covered by the warran-
ty of habitability law. what can
you do? The statute itself does
not provide any speciﬁc remedies.
but the courts have developed two

types of remedies for" tenants
when the warranty of habitability
isbrcachsd. Flrst,youmaybecn-
titled to a reduction in the
amount of rent which would
otherwise be due to the landlord.
The reduction in rent will reflect
the decreased value of the apart-
ment due to the unsafe condition.
Second. if you have been injured
or any of your property damaged
as a result of the defective condi-
tion then you are entitled to be
compensated for such damage or
injury.

in seeking legal redress you can
choose either a defensive or afﬁr-
mative posture. The landlord can
be sued for damages or you can
withhold a portion of rent and
wait for the landlord to initiate a
suit. If the landlord sues you it is
possible to make the judge aware
of the unsafe conditions in the
apartment by raising defenses
and/or counterclaims to the
lawsuit. Do not take any of these
steps without ﬁrst contacting an
attorney. .

if a condition exists in your
apartment which you believe
creates a hazard to health and
safety you should ﬁrst contact
your landlord and try to resolve
the problem informally. Keep
track of all conversations and cor-
respondence with the landlord so
that you can prove, if necessary.
that the landlord knew about the
problem If the landlord does not
correct the defective condition is

spectlon takes place so you can
point out the problems to the in-
spector. The inspector will
prepare a report and will contact
the landlord if any biolations of
the Housing Code have been
found. The report is available to
you and is helpful as documenta-
tion of the defects In the apart-
ment. if the landlord still does not
make the necessary repairs you
should consider bringing the
landlord to court or withholding a
portion of the rent. Again. do not
take these steps until you have
spoken with an attorney.

Your rights under the warranty
of habitability law cannot be
waived. If you ‘sign a lease con-
taining a waiver of these rights.
the waiver (not the lease) is in-
valid. Leascs often contain two
types of provisions which are at-

tempts to have tenants waive
rights ,undc the warranty of
habitability. Ono provision states
that the tenant takes tbs pranissa
“as is". This is invalid as

to health and satay issout is
not invalid in regard to problmu
that do not have an emu on
health and safety. The second
type of provision states that if any
property belonging to the tenant
is damaged due to a defect in the
apartment. the landlord is only
responsible if the defect wu club
cd by the landlord's ncﬂlgencc.

landlord is liable even in the
absence of negligence or
misconduct.

The warranty of habitability is
but one of many laws in New
York State providing protection
to tenants. Future articles will ad-
dress additional aspects of
tenants' rights. » D
