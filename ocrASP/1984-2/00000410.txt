I admire that."

who scored on the 58-yard return.
Then Russell fumbled the ball on
the second play of the next drive
with Southern Connecticut
recovering on the 27. Four
rushing plays later, the Owls
found themselves up 26-0. The
scoring play came on a seven-yard
keeper by Sirignano.

Owls’ coach Gilbride let
Sirgnano have the rest of the day
off and inserted his second string
junior quarterback Jim Takacs. It
made no difference in their
offense.

On Takac’s first series, the
Owls kept the ball on the ground
for 12 out of 13 plays, and march-
ed 92 yards for a score. tearing
right through the demoralized
Albany State defense with more
proﬁciency than any other club
has this season.

Coach Ford utilized the re-
mainder of the game to look at
converted third string quarter-
back Alan Pedley. Pedley, a
sophomore who started the
season as a running back, got no
assistance from his offensive line
and coughed up the football deep
in Dane's territory late in the
fourth quarter to lead the Owls to
their ﬁnal touchdown. A

Ford is now trying to forget last
week’s nightmare and is concen-
trating on ﬁnding a defensive for-
mula to stop Cortland's premier
fullback Dave Cook. who is less
than 100 yards from breaking the
3000—yard plateau.

“The Southern Connecticut
game is etched in stone," said
Ford, speaking via telephone
from his ofﬁce Thursday after-
noon. “You have to learn from
your mistakes but you can't dwell
on the past."

Ford knows though that the‘
"past" can be useful and he clear-
lY remembers Cook burning the
Danes defense for 185 yards last
season in their 14-7 loss to the
Dragons.

“He's the type of back that you
have to gang tackle,” says Ford.
"He's very compact. has great leg
drive and acceleration.”

Paw Prints: injured QB Mike

Gerber and Sanders.

"Our only mistake as far as
Vermont was we played that
match down a little bit. We were
looking ahead to the weekend,
the SUNYACs. before we even
played that match," said
Elsenberg.

Last Thursday the Danes beat
the University of Massachusetts
6-3. The two teams split in singles
with Schmitz. Eisenberg and Der-
mansky winning and Grossman.
Gerber and Sanders losing. Coach
Lewis was “very pleased” with
doubles play in which Albany
swept Massachusetts.

Albany's strong and consistent
doubles play of late, especially at
Massachusetts. is a good sign for
the SUNYACs where doubles
might decide the tournament.

Eisenberg said. “The whole
team is very confident. We're all
playing good tennis and hopefully
will come out on top again this
year."

 

 

Men harrlers top two in? Jersey”

By Mike Turkady
srurwursn

The Albany State men’s
cross-country team took its
best traveling squad down to
Washington Crossing State
Park where the Dane's ﬁne
scoring runners surrounded
Trenton State's best runner,
shut out the entire Montclair
State team. and broke the
course record as well. The new
course record is now held by
junior lan Clements who
smashed the old record by
twelve seconds as he blew by
Trenton's Tim Gallagher in the
last mile to win in 25:48 over
the fast. but treacherous
5.0-milc course.

Both senior Ed McGill. the
third-place ﬁnisher, and cap-
tain Jim Erwin, fourth, also
broke the old record as well,
finishing in 25:54 and 25:55
respectively. It was Erwin,

however, who led from the
start, taking the top fifteen
runners, most of them from
Albany, through the first mile
in about 4:30 or better.

"There were a couple of
downhills in that first mile. but
it was still very fast," said cap-
tain Chris Callaci. fourth for
Albany and fifth overall.
“Everybody ran as hard as
they could for the ﬁrst two and
a half miles so that they could
get into the woods ﬁrst." ex-
plained sophomore Tim Hoff.
sixth overall behind Callaci.
The dangerously narrow and
twisting trail through the
wooded section of the course
allowed very little changing of
position.

When the leaders came out
of the woods with a mile to go,
Trenton's Gallagher had work-
ed his way to the front. but
Clements put on an awesome

  

surge to win going away while
McGill and Erwin closed on
Gallagher. Clements and Er-
win were named runners-of-
the-meet by Head Coach Bob
Munsey. '

“We had our ﬁve scorers
finish in a pack that was
spread only sixteen seconds'
from front to back. It makes it
very tough for other teams to
score against you when you
when you can dominate a race
as we did this one." Munsey
explained. “l'm happy that the
team is working so well as a
unit. That's important."

The two wins gives Albany a
record of 7-3. with two shut-
outs and a winning streak of
five in a row. Tomorrow the
Danes travel to SUNY Oneon-
ta for a two-way dual meet
with SUNY Binghamton and
host Oneonta. Cl
