“The women were such strong com-
petitors out there,” remarked assistant-
coach Kelly Haskins. “Numerous coaches
from the opposing teams commented
about the team. about how much they
have improved over last year. And they're
right; the womenhave all brought their
times down and are just running super."

“We were second without the aid of two
of our most consistent runners," com-
mented Head Coach Ron White, referring
to Lynn Jacobs (hamstring injury). and
Rachel Braslow (observing Yom Kippur).
“The team. in this meet, demonstrated the
depth l've been talking about all season
long. it means so much when a team can

White was pleased with the individual
performances of his team as well as with
the overall team finish. “Karen Kurthy, in
ﬁnishing third, proved to be a front runner
against top competition. And Kim Pet-
tichord was outstanding out there; she has
really improved over last year." Notable

be Saturday. October 13 at Union College

third consecutive Capital District title.

feels conﬁdent about the meet.

“Last year. we were the underdogs. This

Player suspended for one game In tie to Siena

«a

day's game. when the Danes outplayed
Potsdam only to lose. 3-2. Albany con-
trolled the pace of the game and had may
opportunities to score, but couldn’t
capitalize on them.

Presbie scored early in the first half to
give Albany a 1-0 lead they held until
halftime. Potsdam scored two quick goals
in the second half to take the lead. With 15
minutes left in the game. Cohen scored on
a header to tie the game at two. On the last
offensive rush of the game. Potsdam got
the winning goal.

“We lost to a teamthat we shouldn't have
lost to in Potsdam." said Schieffelin.
“We've been practicing well.-so it's very

disappointing. We couldn‘t even beat
Siena. and they're two rungs below
Potsdam."

The Danes face SUNYAC rival
Binghamton at home on Saturday, which
would normally be a tough game. But with
Merritt, Jeff Hackett and Francisco
Duarte injured, and with Cohen serving a
mandatory one-game suspension, Albany
will have a near impossible task.

“it’s a gross injustice that Scott has to
sit out the Binghamton game.” said
Schieffelin. “He's suspended because of
the stupidity of the referees. Scott and Carl
loos have been mainstays on defense.
Without Scott. we don’t have much quali-
ty on defense.” I3

I we sponsemmn

One of the major problems that
as plagued Albany State's men's
occer team this year has been in-
onsistency; a good performance
5 inevitably followed up by a
or performance.

Only one thing remains fairly
onstant — no matter what per-
ormance the Danes give, they
till can’t seem to win. Tuesday's
-2 tie against Siena extended
lbany's winless streak to ﬁve
nd put their record at 3-6—2.

Last year’s team was primarily
t: defensive team.,.as the Danes
nly surrendered 14 goals the en-
tire season. if the offense could
manage two or more goals a
game, you could count on the
team winning. Quite a far cry
from this year.

“if we let up three goals a
game. we're not going to win too
many." said Tihan Presbie.
“Last year we gave up 14 goals.
This year we gave up seven goals

~ in one game(Plattsburgh)."

Two key losses on defense this
year were Mike Miller and Tom
Merritt. Merritt. two-time All-
SUNYAC goalie. has missed most
of the season with a had back.
Miller, a cornerstone on defense
lav years. graduated last year.

“We miss Mike Miller a lot,"
said Presbie. “He would stop
everything back there. We didn’t
realize how much we needed him
until he was gone.”

Merritt has been replaced by
freshman Howard Tygar. who
after a quick start, has looked
shaky at times. according to Head

Coach Bill Schieffelin.

“Howard's playing like a
freshman," said Schieffelin.

He's good sometimes. ‘ and
sometimes he's not. He gets into
trouble when he tries to think
about what he has to do instead
of just doing it."

Schieffelin took particular of-
fense at Siena's ﬁrst goal. which
tied the game at one. “There was
a long pass that i thought should
have been cut off by Howard.”
said Schieffelin. “He should have
come off the line to 'get the ball.
or at least come up to cut off the
angle of the shot."

But nothing irritated Schief-
felin and his players more thatn
the ofﬁciating. Schieffelin used
words like “horrendous” and
“spastic” to describe the referees.

“The referees had no control
over the game." said Schieffelin.
“They let.some calls go and they
were calling others. If the referees
are inconsistent. the players don’t
know; how they can play. The
heag'coach at Marist blackballed.
this‘.‘one.refcr‘ee years ago; he's
just not capable of reffing college
soccer."

Scott Cohen. Albany's best
player on Tuesday according to
Schieffelin. had mine chriiccr
words for the relcree. For his out-
burst. Cohen was awarded a
yellow card.

“i was frustrated with the way
the game was going." said
Cohen. “Siena is not it team that
we should be tied with. But it was
mainly the refs — they were
awful. l was just cursing in
general, just that it was too

on boaters tie Siena to-extend Win

loud."

There was little doubt about
the yellow card, as Cohen deserv-
ed one. The second yellow card
ws an entirely different matter.
With ten seconds left in the ﬁnal
overtime. Cohen was carded for a
ﬂagrant foul. The contact made
was nothing more than what was
occuring throughout the game.
What made it more ridiculous was
that Cohen had the ball when the
foul was called.

“I had the ball and I was about
to pass it when their guy bumped
me. " said Cohen. “The ref didn’t
even know what was going on. He
saw two guys hit each other and
assumed it was me. The Siena
players were all screaming that it
was my second foul and he listen-
ed to them."

According to Schieffelin. the
ofﬁcials blew a call that led to
Albany‘s ﬁrst goal. “One of our
players threw the ball in early."
said ~the coach. “Siena wasn't
ready. and we scored. The
referees didn't handle the situa-
tion well," The ball was put in by
l’tesbic. the team's leading
scorer.

After Siena took a 2-1 lead ear~
ly in the wcond half. Albany tied
the more With 20 minutes left in
the game. Mike Jasmin hit the
cm' 'cr of the crossbar and the hull
look a lucky bounce into the net.

“We were very lucky to tie
them." said Schieffelin. “With
one minute left in regulation,
Siena took a shot that hit the
crossbar. We should have lost."

This contrasted with last Satur-

the game, failing to capitalize on scoring
opportunities.

Head Coach Amy Kidder said. “On of-
fense. it seems that we're not attacking
well. with one attacker carrying the ball
until she is forced to give it up. Our pass-
ing. which has been improving, wasn’t
working well and our defense failed to pick
up their two best players."

The lack of offensive punch is reflected
in the team's statistics: so far they have
scored nine goals in nine games with the
opposition holding them scoreless ﬁve
times this season. Another factor in the
season has been the team's difﬁcult
schedule. playing tough squads like 'the
University of Rochester. lthaca. Cortland
and LeMoyne.

in their match last Sunday at St.
Lawrence. the team had many defensive
lapses. losing to them by a score of 5-2.
Albany‘s first goal came from Dana Stam
with 2:34 left in the ﬁrst half, assisted by
Kim Kosslek. Kosslek later scored rt goal
with 47 seconds left in the half.

The team was hampered by the absence
of goalkeeper Maureen Keller and was
forced to start Kathy Di Bennédeto for the
first time ever in goal.

“There were some bright spots in the
game for us.” said assistant coach Lisa
Meyers. “Our passing game was better
than it has been in the past and Di Ben-
nedeto proved that she could be a backup
goaltender. We were affected by the
absence of Hulkis and Lozsrides who
didn't travel with us and four others who
were forced to stay home."

The schedule won't get any easier for the
team as they host Kidder’s alma mater Spr-
ingﬁeld College.

Kidder. who is looking forward to play-
ing former school, said. “if we can carry
over our spirit in practice to the game
itself, we'll start to win some games. We
need to relax and have fun during our
games and eventually the talent we have
will show through.”
