EcOnomiCs profs see Reaganomics as Shortfad

(COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE) Though star-
ting their fourth school year since the ad-
vent of “Reaganonmics,” college
economics departments still aren’t taking
supply-side economics very seriously.

“Supply side is a political issue,” claim-
ed Professor Phillip Cagan, head of Col-
umbia University’s economics department.

Cagan, like many of the professors in-
terviewed for this article, said he believes,~
“it will be gone in a few years."

But some supply-side proponents.
notably former Southern Cal professor
Arthur Laffer, contend the theory is in fact
making headway in college classrooms.
“It's being taught everywhere,” Laffer
said “and has become the basic precept of
the (economics) professional journals."

Laffer was one of the first advocates of
supply-side theory, which forecasts that
tax cuts -- not the “pump priming” of
Keynesian economics -- would best
stimulate the economy.

Laffer’s ideas attracted a small coterie
of followers, including a Wall Street Jour-
nal editorialist named Jude Wanniski.
Wanniski’s writings eventually attracted
converts like Ronald Reagan, Sen. William
Roth and Rep. Jack Kemp.

All, of course, eventually helped mold
America’s current supply-side economic
policy. Despite evidence the policy has
helped generate record levels of economic
growth, many campus econ departments
haven’t adjusted their courses.

“Professors have the luxury of being
able to teach obsolete theories longer than
government and business can adhere to
them at the risk of losing money," Wan-
niski scoffed.

The reason it’s not taught is that it’s not
a very good theory, others counter.

The recent economic recovery is explain-
ed better by traditional economic theory
than by supply-side theory. said Professor
Michael Veseth, an economist at the
University of Puget Sound in Tacoma,
Wa.

“The big spending cuts, world recession
and large structural deficits that caused the
recovery have more to do with old-
fashioned Keynesian pump-priming than
vith supply-side economics," he insisted.

Keynesian theory, hatched by British
economist John Maynard Keynes, has
been the basis of American economic
policy since the l930s, when President
Franklin Roosevelt employed it to try to
spark a recovery from the Great
Depression.

Keynes‘ then-radical advice was to let
the government go into debt in order to get
money to inject into the economy, thus
stimulating consumer demand. With con-
sumer demand up, business would begin
producing goods and services again to
meet the demand.

When demand and government spen-
ding sparked inﬂation. Keynes advised the
government to reduce spending.

Until then, most schools taught
“classical economies,” which stressed in-
dividual choicemaking in a society tending
toward full employment, explains John
Sumansky of the Joint Council on

Despite the fact that Reaganomics, cur-
rently a hot topic, employs much of supply
side theory, not one class at SUNYA is
devoted entirely to this theory.

There is nothing new about Ronald
Reagan's supply side economics claims
Economics Department chair Pong S. Lee.

.“Supply side theory has been around for
a long time", said Lee, “what is new is
that it's never been the major basis for
federal policy".

Lee said that supply-side theory does not
warrant a full semester course, because
“there is not enough to talk about".

Supply side economic theory calls for
reduced corporate taxes to encourage in-
dustries to increase capital spending in
such areas as refitting industrial plants and

I building new factories. explained Helen G.

Horowitz, Director of Undergraduate
Studies in Economics.

“Reagan reduced control of industry",
said Horowitz, asserting “that's not supp<
ly side, that's free market”.

Economic Education.

“Studies of the overall economy and
Keynesian theory eventually didn't burst
on the scene,”.Sumansky said. “They
were forced on us by the Great Depression
and attempts to end it.”

Years after the theory became govem-
ment practice, college economics depart-
ments began teaching it. Since the publica-
tion of Prof. Paul Samuelson's landmark
Keynesiah textbook in the late forties,
Keynesian economics has been the stan-
dard emphasis in most departments.

“Colleges are not teaching supply-side
courses," asserted Vanderbilt economist
Professor John Siegfried. "if it's taught,
it's taught as part of another course.
Strong supply-siders were talking about it
in 1968, but it didn‘t have a label."

"it's a very important idea," he conced-
ed. “But now there’s a lot of attention in
the popular press. The increase (in em-
phasis) is not in academic areas."

Horowitz said she teaches little or no
supply side economics in her classes.
"Professors", explained Horowitz,
“follow a mandatory outline and are free
to supplement that outline with whatever
they prefer".

“Most of what I know about supply side
economics, i learned from following the
news", said Doug Lankler. an economics
student at SUNYA.

“Supply side theory means different
things to different people". said
Economics Professor Edward F. Renshaw.

“Supply side theory is a different
thing”, said Renshaw, explaining that “ef-
forts to develop it got bogged down. i
don't know if they will ever agree on it".
he added that from a policy point of view
it is not yet clear that supply can be
manipulated to produce a healthy
economy.

“Generally economists have paid more
attention to product demand than supp-
ly”, said Renshaw. This could be because
the supply of goods is subject to fewer
fluctuations than consumer demand, he

Wanniski attributed campuses' reloc-
tance to teach supply-side theory on’its
own to simple stuffiness. Tenured
economics professors have a vested career
interest in defending “outdated” Keyne-
sian theory. M

Things will change as younger
economists successfully use supply-side
theory to predict the economy's perfor-
mance. Wanniski predicts. .

“Supply siders," for example, “are the
only ones who predicted the current
economic boom without inflation, ” he
asserted.

“Eventually schools recognize" who’s
got the better track record, he said, “and
switch to supply side."

Because nearly all of the nation's 65,000
economists are Keynesians, Wanniski said
he thinks'it may take a generation for col-
lege economics departments to begin em-
phasising supply-side theory. ’13

added.

Renshaw said he spends a fair amount
of time teaching supply-side economics.
“Most classes spend a lot more time talk-
ing about consumer demand theory". he
said.

“Professors are constrained as to what's
in text books", which tend to deal primari-
ly with economic demand, Renshaw add-
ed. Renshaw said he distributes additional
information in his classes, but said, “Sup
ply side theory is (just) beginning to creep
into the books."

“Most text books have something abbot
supply side theory," said Horowitz, “if
only to refute it."

Lee said courses such as
macroeconomics. which give a general
understanding of economics, should be
covering supply side theory for at least two
weeks of each semester.

"Theories behind supply side economies
are still pretty crude." said Renshaw. “It’s
kind of like blood-letting. It will get you
through a recession, but at the cost of los-
ingjobs,” he said. El
