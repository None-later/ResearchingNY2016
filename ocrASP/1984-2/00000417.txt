About 50 wheelchair-bound
people. including five SUNYA
students. got the chance to play
volleyball and go horseback
riding this weekend as part of a
variety.of events featured at the
Third Annual New York State
Wheelchair Sports Exposition.

SUNYA. junior Robert Pipia
led a hockey workshop. as well.

The participants learned ways
to play many sports in workshops
designed to provide hands-on ex-
perience in volleyball, track and
ﬁeld, I. basketball, floor hockey.
weightlifting, archery. ping-pong.
and horseback riding.

“This is one of the few oppor-
tunities we get to demonstrate
these sports." explained Denton
Johnson. a track and field
workshop leader and a member of
the ‘Burke Bullets Team from the
Burke Rehabilitation Center in
White Plains. New York.

“it’s very therapeutic for the
participants,” Johnson said, ad-
ding, that disabled people are
oftenynot used to doing things for
themselves. The workshops in-
spire those who are wheelchair-
bound by showing them how to

  

  

compete. he said. .

SUNYA's Director of Disabled
Student Services Nancy Belowich
agreed with Johnson, explaining
that the workshops 'were both
therapeutic and fun. “When you
are an inactive person, any activi-
ty is good for you." she said.

Disabled athletes need special
training, explained Jennifer
Brown. another workshop leader
and a member of the Burke
Bullets Team. The programs for
wheelchair athletes stress
shoulder and arm development
because that is'where “the most
pressure will be applied." she
said. adding that proper exercise,
diet, and weight training are
essential for a program to
succeed.

According to Jerry Simmons,
who, with his wife. co-owns a
therapy riding school called
Stonehill Stables. horseback
riding is especially helpful in re-
juvenating muscles and
straightening bones.

Simmons, who held a special
demonstration during the exposi-
tion. explained that modiﬁed sad-
dles and specially trained horses
are needed for disabled riders.

get used to braces and
wheelchairs," Simmons said.
Small horses. about ‘5 feet. work
out best. according to Simmons,
who added that “we are always
looking for good, steady horses."

Workshops were led by several
internationally and nationally
recognized wheelchair-bound
athletes. some of who were
associated with the Burke Center.

The athletes were originally
assembled by Martin Ball, a well-
known wheelchair racer, explain-
ed Pablo Negron. Director of
Disabled Student Services at Hud-
son Valley Community College.

The workshops, held
throughout the day, were “aimed
at newcomers to wheelchair
sports,” said Debra Hamilton, a
member of the eXDQsition’s plan-

ning committee.

“This is the ﬁrst time we have
held the exposition during the
school year,” said Negron. ex-
plaining that the event has usually
been held during the summer.
“We wanted more (college)
students to get involved," he
added.

More young children par-
ticipated in this year’s workshops
Negron continued. although he
said the planning committee had
hoped not to place an emphasis
on any one particular age group.

The exposition, attended by
about 50 people, did not include
as many workshops as in previous
years, Negro said. “This is a non-
profit organization.” stated
Negron, adding that the biggest
expense for the event is supplying
hotel accomodations for the
workshop leaders.

“l was not pleased with the
number of participants this
year," said Belowich. a member
of the exposition’s planning com-
mittee. “I felt sorry for the 200 to
300 more people we could have
serviced." she continued. adding
that because the event is held only
once a year it is hard to build a
large following for it.

The exposition was created
three years ago in part by
Belowich. Negron and Hamilton.

According to Belowich, the
goal of the founders was to
“foster interest in health and
fitness" among disabled people.
“We hoped that more programs
would develop in the area," she
added.

The program was funded by
grants from local businesses, the
Faculty-Student Association of
Hudson Valley Community Col-
lege and the Hudson Valley Stu-
dent Senate. D

News updates I

' after recent vandalism.,said Building

Supervisor Darren Fleeger.

student information at the information
Desk at the Campus Center had been

Flccger.

Spring schedules

Midterms have just arrived yet ad-
visors are already sending out notifica-
tion of pre-registrastion for the spring
semester.

are available to students at the Campus
Center information Desk. the
registrar's office, and at the Center for
Undergraduate Education(CUE).

in addition to a complete list of the

spring 1985 courses. the booklet also in-
cludes the academic calendar for next

Charities chosen “

Telethon staff members decided Sun-
day night to devote their fund-raising
this year to the Albany Boy’s Club and
to the Drakeland Daycare Center.

Co-chair of Telethon Eileen Shapiro
said Albany Boys Club was chosen
because it was in need of recreational
equipment and building supplies. The
Boy’s Club already provides a juvenile
delinquency program and hopes to start
a “latch-key program” for children
whose parents work. and come home to
empty houses. ‘

Co-chair of Telethon Eric Dorf said
that Drakeland Daycare Center of Ar-
bor Hill, a newly established day care
center especially for single parent
homes was chosen because it needs
cribs. toys. and shelves to get it started.

Telethon staff members based their
decision on whether organizations were
child-oriented, spent money in the
capital district and had had no previous
major contributions to their need. act.“
cording to Dorf. He added that
“everyone felt very strongly" about the
decision to contribute to the Albany .
Boy's Club.

New JSC‘ adviser

Newly appointed .lSC-Hillel advisor
Jay Kellman hopes thast he can con-
tinue to "promote the SUNYA Jewish
community".through his new position.

Calling.. himself Jewisth “self-
taught," Kellman sees his new part-
time post as essentially an advisory
position. I

“i am there to help students," said
Kellman. explaining. "i believe student
organizations should be run by
students."

Jewish organizations at SUNYA, begin-
ning as director of the Kosher kitchen
on Dutch. followed by 2 years with the
Chabab organization that supports the
Jewish community, to his full-time

New frat at SUNYA...

A colony of the National Fraternity
of Alpha Epsilon Pi, to be known as
Alpha Nu. was started at SUNYA last
month with a record 53 pledges. Alpha
Epsilon Pi is recognized by SA and is
the first completely socially oriented
fraternity on campus. The fraternity
will hold its ﬁrst rush next semester
when it will be accepting new pledges.

 

The current pledges will be travelling .
to Syracuse University in November to
be initiated into the already established
Alpha Epsilon Pi chapter there.

Pledge master Andy Rothstein feels
that the fraternity will play a large part
in campus life. There will be many
Alpha Nu sponsored social functions as
well as a little sisters organization so
women will be able to get directly in-
volved as well.

Another on the way

The largest international fraternity in
the country, Tau Kappa Epsilon. will be
coming to SUNYA next month.

Newly elected SUNYA TKE presi-
dent Barry Pollack said that TKE is a
social fraternity. serving the community
and the student body. and promises to
be “a lot of fun for everyone.”‘

Already recognized by SA, TKE will
offer to its members housing and stu-
dent loans along with various social ac-
tivities, explained Pollack.

Pollack. who joined TKE ﬁrst at
Fairleigh Dickinson College in New
Jersey. said that RPl's TKE has offered
to “help out with whatever they can" in
the organization of the newly-formed
