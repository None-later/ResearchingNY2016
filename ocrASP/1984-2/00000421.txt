“When we approach people on campus

' and ask people to vote, almost every single

one of them Is registered to vote. Very few

I people are unregistered," asccording to

Kann. NYPIRO has registered approx-
imately 3.000 campus residents, he said.
SA_ has registered 3.000 to 3,200
students. Gawley estimated.
Gawley said SA registered 1,600
students during the freshman and transfer

student orientation sessions held last sum- »
~ mer. In April, he said, a drive held during

the campus housing sign-up netted about

I 400 registrants.

“Quad sweeps,” Gawley said, “were

- . really effective." Members of the Student

 March against rape

Rezsin Adams of Albany asserted that

' J “rape. is a major crisis and all women and
I: I ' men are involved.” She attended, she said,
‘  to show her feeling of solidarity.

Tami Noam explained that she had

.._' l come all the way from SUNY Binghamton
 with seven other people. She said she
I" would like to see a march like Albany's

 

rganized in Binghamton.

Action Committee spent two nights each
registering residents of Dutch, Indian and

Colonial Quads, during the sweeps, he ,

explained.

‘Volunteers at Dutch and Indian combin-
ed to register more than 400 students,
while at Colonial, at least 100 students
signed up to vote, according to Oawley.

One-night sweeps on State and Alumni
garnered a total of about 140 registrants,
he said.

The rest of the students registered by
SA, either signed up during “A Night at
the Bars,” when students tabled in five
downtown bars. or at tables in the Campus
Center, noted Gawley.

NYPIRG was also responsible for
registering 1,000 Albany residents who are
not students. said Herrick. II]

Howard Sellers, l3, earned on his bicy-
cle; his mother participated in the march.
“i want to hear what they’re saying, and
it’s right — they know what they're talking
about.” he said.

Overall, participants said, the night was
meant to empower and inspire women and
others to claim their rightful, safe place in
this society. ‘

. “I used to be scared of going out," said
one woman, “but I made a choice, I have
no intention ofIlving in fear.” E]
