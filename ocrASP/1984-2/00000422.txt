Intramural athletics for Alumni quad.
and off campus residents are in the
students' hands now since one of it's
founders, alumni advisor Kingsley Greene
stepped down from his post after more
than 10 years of service.

The program is now run completely by
elected students. The organization is Stu-
dent Association funded. It is a co-ed
groupcoordinating games in volleyball,
basketball, football and softball.

‘ “Kingsley was the head honcho," accor-
ding to Downtown Athletics President.
John Reilly. “ Blondie(Ken Ardvino)
'helped out a lot, too," he addded. '

Greene explained that he stepped down
because he “began to look at it as a
burden...the new mix of students had less
time."

I When Ardvino became involved in his
'business and wasn’t able to help out,
IGreene had to step in and take over the
management. “I wasn’t interested in
that." Greene said.

“When it was time to rake the field.”
said Ardvino, “Kingsley was there with no
students to help him. He gave the program
IO or II years, he couldn’t be expected to
do anything more,” noted Ardvino.

“It was rewarding for me." said
Greene. He said that he has “felt pangs of
regret. remorse and worry" since he made
his decision to resign the responsibilities.

“Greene didn't just walk out on us,"
said Reilly. “We knew the spring of '83
that he would be leaving, so we made some

 

Downtown Athletics facing a
‘shaky future without Greene

changes in '84 to learn the ropes.”
“They're kind of winging it without any
guidance except what I can give," said
Greene. ' .
.“March of last year I spoke to Alumni
Area Coordinator, Tom Gebhart about
finding some faculty advisement for the
group, but because of budgetary con-

straints," said Greene, “he was unable to

provide staffing support."

Greene said he has mixed feelings about
the eventual result of not having faculty
advisement. “There are some good
students running things this fall and I’m
conﬁdent that they can carry it out this
year," said Greene. .

“Depending on effective student
leaders, the program could have irregular
leadership,” said Greene. “Guidance from
professional staff would provide continui-
ty," he added.

“We’ve been getting accustomed,” said
Reilly. “Kingsley helped us get the ball
rolling this year," he said. “We know we
have to do a lot more now and we do it,”
he explained. ‘

“Downtown Athletics has always been a
friendly organization," said Downtown
Athletics Treasurer Guy Sansone. “That
was Kingsley’s way."

“We have a fruitful program that a lot
of students beneﬁt from,” said Greene.
He noted that in forming their own teams
many students have developed fraternity-
Iike groups.

“Many of the ‘oId-timers’ still hang out
together,” said Greene, explaining that
every year Downtown Athletics invites the
alumni back Old Timers Day for softball.

Wisconsin students stage?
. ‘d’rink-in ’,to fight 21 efforts

(COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE) Students
at the University of Wiswnsin-Madison -
joined by disgruntled students from across
the state — staged a mass "drink-in” on
the steps of the state capitol two weeks ago
to protest efforts to raise the drinking age
there to 2|.

“We, as students, understand that we
and our peers will not stop drinking
because the law dictates that we do,” pro-
claimed. Dan Katz, legislative affairs direc-
tor for the Wisconsin Student Association,
which represents student governments
from campuses around the state.

The deﬁance of new drinking policies
expressed by Katz and other students at the
Wisconsin drink-in —— where the day's
motto was “F-ck ’em if we casn’t take a
drink” -— has beenvechoed by students
around the nation over the last month.

While some experts predicted tough new
campus drinking regulations nationwide
would cause some students unease as they
learned new ways to socialize, it appears
that many students are flaunting the
regulations openly and at times even out—
wardly rebelling against them.

At North Carolina State University. for
instance, state alcohol control agents

, . recently busted 36 students in one night for
, alcoholK policy violations at a campus frat
5 party.

“Alcohol-related problems are obvious-
ly taking up more time of campus law en-
forcement agencies these days, and alcohol
abuse is a greater problemhor at least
recognized more," said Dan Keller, direc-
tor of Campus Crime Prevention Pro-
grams and chief of public safety at the
University of Louisville.

“We have two or three major things
happening at the same time that are mak-
ing the alcohol problem greater, or at least
more visible on a lot of campuses,” he
explained.

Fro one thing, “students who may have
been drinking legally off campus are now
transferring their drinking habits to cam-
pus where new policies make drinking
illegal."

In addition, “many states are now rais-
ing their drinking ages to 2l,‘creating
displaced drinkers who have no place to
drink except on campus," he said.

Finally, Keller noted, “alcohol abuse
has replaced drug abuse as the number one
student behavior problem. And all these
problems combined are really making
alcohol an issue at many colleges and
universities."

The whole“”get tough” attitude toward
student drinking, some believe, is only
making the matter worse at many schools.

“Any time you trim back people’s rights
and opportunity, there will be some reac-
tions." said Jonathan Burton. executive
director of the National Interfraternity
Conference.

Just as many students and fraternities
were endorsing new drinking policies and
campous alcohol awareness programs, he
said, administrators and politicians started
cramming new rules down students‘
throats.

Instead officials should be working to

“change attitudes as opposed to legisla-
tion," Burton said.
' “The whole movement might have been
much more effective if the campus alcohol
education programs had been given more
time to pick up speed,” he theorized.
“First comes education, their minds are
changed. and then legislation can be
enacted with cvcryone‘s full support."

And while the new campus alcohol
crackdown is prcoccupying police.
frustrating administrators, and angering
students, it may not be having any effect
on what it was designed to prevent: a A
recent Boston University study found that
raising the drinking age from l8 to 20 five
years ago has had no effect on traffic
deaths or the drinking habits of undcragcd
students in Massachusetts.

The only thing the law has done. says
study author Robert Smith, is foster
among students “a cynicism toward the
legislative process and disregard for law
cul'or'tcrncnt." l.‘

The next night agents arrested 53 more
NCSU students on similar charges.

Police arrested 56 students for liquor
violations at Illinois State University dur-
ing the ﬁrst weekend in September. and ar-
rcstedl47 more violators the following
weekend.

Indiana makes random checks in an at-
tempt to enforce the new alcohol policy on
that campus, where freshmen supposedly
,V believe “that you come to [U to get
 drunk," said Dean of Students Michael
3 Gordon. K . '
' “Some very important people, including
some students, staff. and faculty, are will-
ing to say, ‘Ha. (the campus alcohol
_ policy) is all a very funny joke,"’ Gordon

complained.

That's evidently the feeling of some
Notrc Dame students. who last summer
“kidnapped” a bust of famed football
coach Knutc Rockne to prolcst the
school's drinking policy.

Along with a color picture of the bust
comfortably tanning at a nearby beach,
the Notrc Dumc student paper has rcccivcd
a ransom nolc warning that the Rockne
sculpture won‘t be returned “'til the
students have their beer."

Problcms and complications with
alcohol policies also are plaguing such
schools as Fort Hays State University,
Arizona State. St. Bonaventure. and New
Mexico. to name just a few.
