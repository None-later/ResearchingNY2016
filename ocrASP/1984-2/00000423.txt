year,” she added. “But it's a small

'number of faculty who do It."
The authors found three common types of

. harassers. v
The “counselor-helper" preys on troubled
students' needs for close relationships. The
'P‘power broker" bargains grades and
recommendations for sexual favors. and
the "intellectual seducer” draws personal

, information from students in class.

The authors' ﬁndings are consistent with
those in other harassment studies.

' The University of California at Berkeley

determined in 1979 that 30 percent of its
female students received unwanted sexual
attention from instructors. .

In a I982 University of Washington study.
4i percent of campus women claimed
they'd been sexually harassed. In 1983,
nearly a fourth of Penn State's women
students said they had been harassed.
“Our policy on sexual harassment allows
students three channels for complaints,”
reported Vicky Eide of Iowa State Univer»
sity’s Affirmative Action office. “Infor-
mal complaints go through advisors or
department chairs. Affirmative Action
handles formal complaints, or ‘students

 

the Iowa Civil Rights Commission.’

But few women ever file charges, she
added.

“They come in and discuss options. but
never come back,” Bide said. “At this
time no cases are under investigation.”
THe University of California at Santa Bar-
bara handles about 20 sexual harassment
complaints a year through its University‘
Grievance Officer (UGO) and a number of
other contacts.

Only one formal grievance has been ﬁled
since 1981, said Dr. Harleen McAda, the
current UGO.

THe low numbers of complaints are
deceiving, Dzeich claimed, and can make
colleges complacent.

“An institution can kid itself.” she said.
“But it may not be an environment in
which students are comfortable
complaining."

Informal complaints are easier to make.
Dzeich added, but these aren’t formally
recorded or thoroughly investigated.

A better method, she said, is to confront
the harasser non-aggressively. If he con-
tinues, complain to as trusted advisor,
department head or administrator.

“Keep records of events," she stressed.
“Write him a letter and keep a copy of it.
Document everything."

Ed Rollins, Reagan's campaign
manager. in an interview Sunday on the
CBS program “Face the Nation," said
that, “I think what Mr. Mondale did in the
debate is. he became a credible
candidate."

Robert G. Beckel, Mondale’s campaign
manager. appeared on the program with
Rollins and said the Democratic candidate
gained six points in the polls since the
debate and added, “Walter Mondale prov-
ed himself to be a leader, in command on
the stage with the great communicator.”

According to a New York Times article.
the revival of the Democratic Presidential
campaign has apparently dimmed the pro-
spects for major Republican gains in the
House of Representatives, according to
strategists in both parties.

Party strategists were hoping that Mr.
Reagan would be so far ahead in his own
race by mid-October that he would be free
to devote more time and energy to electing
Republicans to Congress. In particular,
they wanted him to schedule more visits to
marginal House districts and put his in-

fluence ‘on the: line for Republican
candidates.
Vice President George Bush was

V overheard saying that “we tried to kick a

little ass last night," the day after Thurs-
day's Vice Presidential debate. as reported
In the New York Times.

In an appearance on “Meet the Press"
Sunday, Representative Geraldine Ferraro
said that the comments could reflect the
fact "that perhaps they are beginning to
get a little worried when they see the polls
moving.”

Mondale was already pointing toward
their debate this Sunday, telling a national
radio audience that Reagan's “good Inten-
tions" aren't enough to ensure peace.

Elsewhere President Reagan was making
a campaign foray into the friendly political
conﬁnes of the South Monday.

The president's one-day swing into the
region that always has given him strong
support included stops in Alabama, South
Carolina and Georgia.

Four years ago, running against
Georgian Jimmy Carter, Reagan carried
every southern state except Georgia. This
year. Reagan is considered the leader in
every state in the South.

Grad students apply education to

problem of missing course credit

Bvaohn Crawford

Blaming the victim.
Knowledge is power. These twu
cliches are taking life and con-
fronting cach taking life and con-
fronting each other in the School
of Social Welfare (SSW).
Masters in Social Welfare (MSW)
graduate students are using their
education to

The

question the ap-
propriateness of Graduate
Advocate

the School's
current
r i c u I u

Wednesday in

room 002. Richardson Hall at
4:30. All those concerned are in-
vited to attend.

The Problem: The MSW
brochure states, “MSW cur-
riculum is a two year (60 credit)
sequence." The Problem is that
the current curriculum does not
reach 60 credits, it only comes to
59 credits. In the past, many
MSW students. like other grads
throughout SUNY. through their
own choosing, graduated with
more than the required credits for
a degree. However, the SSW
recently dropped a 2 credit course
from its “designcd"scquencc.
leaving the curriculum one credit
short of the necessary credits to
graduate. The School plans to
rectify the problem adding one
credit to its current 2 credit Ficld
Instructions I course. Unfor-
tunately this will not take effect
until the Fall of 85. The problem
then is how to make up the cur-
rent absence of 1 credit for the
students caught in the transition
period.

The MSW grads asked that
question at the School's cur-
riculum committee meeting. The
School administrators recom-

mended that they take an extra 2
or 3 credit course to reach the 60
credit requirement. That answer
did not satisfy the graduate
students.

At two well attended MSW
meetings, the graduate students
questioned why they had to take
an extraneous course when all
they were doing was following the
designed curriculum 7 Why were
they burdened with a mishap
caused by the School of Social
Welfare? How appropriate was a
designed curriculum that
necessitated extra credit to
graduate? And would graduate
students have to pay more titan
necessary to graduate?

Another problem disturbed the
MSW grads. The SSW ad-
ministrators used the metaphor of
a contractual situation binding
the MSW grads to take the extra
course and reach 60 credits. The
grads wondcrcd how legitimate
the “contract” was if the sc-
qucucc did not fulfill its objective
of directing the students to their
60 credits because of an SSW
mishap?

Graduate Students Solution: To
organize and present reasonable
and satisfying alternatives for the
correction of tllc SSW mishap.
Their “adjustments”, following
the education the grads received,
will “provide and equitable op-
portutlity for individual fulfill-
ment" — while the grads gain one
credit. The MSW students reason
that if the class entering ill the
Fall of 85 will be given an extra
credit tacked onto a course they
already passed. why not give the
current grads the opportunity to
organize an interim class or
workshop that can fulfill their 1
credit need.

The grads believe they are just

using their field work education
in a practical solution, that educa-
tion “is founded on knowledge of
social work values and ethical
principles” —- not caveat emptor.
In other words they are willing to
work at an adjustment in a
reasonable way — an adjustment
made necessary by a SSW ad-
ministrative mishap. .

The reward: one credit and
School harmony. Plus, the op-
portunity to witness their mentors
belief in their stated principles.

Simple Answer: Congratula-
tions should be given the MSW
grads for their encrgy and
reasonableness ill the face of
frustration. But this problem is
casin solved. Just use that old
reliable SUNY guide: "for every
rule there is a waiver." Solution:
give one retroactive crcdit to the
affected studcllts and allow them
to graduate us their the recruiting
material stalcs — with sixty
crcdits. Why not let them have an
extra credit for the field Instruc-
tion I course they already passed?
One to rcplacc the one misplaced.

One credit will not make these
studcnts better nor \vorsc social
worker.

A Dream Scenario: During
Wednesday’s meeting between
the graduates students and the
SSW administrators, the ad-
ministrators will stand up and
say, “Congratulations. you have
passed our School's pedagogical
anxiety course. You organized
and reasoned through a
frustrating mishap (injustice?)
and presented competent alter-
natives to a situation you did not
create. Reward: 1 credit.
Welcome to professional social
work.” H
