"‘_l"guess l was disappointed when l
foltnd out Cook wasn’t playing." said
Ford. “We were looking forward to the
challenge. I don’t think the team got more
confident when we found out; 1 think we
might have been a little let down."

Coach Larry Czarnetki would not blame
the team’s loss on the injuries to his two
offensive players. “Cook is the type of
back that not only helps the offense, but
he takes pressure off the defense. But
there’s no excuse. Their coach did an ex-
cellent job. They just destroyed our offen—
sivc team." '

Right from the outset, the'Dancs were in
command. On Cortland's first three
drives. they were unable to manage a
firstdown as the Danes, led by Chris
Esposito's two sacks pinned Cortland deep
in their own territory. The Danes were
unable to capitalize on their great field
position. On Albany’s first drive, they
moved down to the 20-yard-line before
Russell threw his first and last interception
of the day.

Finally, on the Dane’s third possession
of the game. they struck. Starting form the
Cortland 39. Russell connected with Chris
Haynor for a l2~yard gain. Then two plays
later. Soldini ran the veer off the left side
and was able to find room on the outside.
He was pushed out of bounds, but not
before the referees said he crossed the
goaline, with 3:23 remaining in the open-
ing quarter. ' I

The Danes scored two more touchdowns
in the first half to forge to a 22-0 halftime
lead. Dana Melvin capped a 46-yard drive
on a 4-yard plunge on third down with
9:” to play in the half.

On the Dragon’s ensuing possession,
Jimmy Colins made the first of his three
interceptions of the day, as he picked off a
Joe Ruyack pass.

On the first play. Russell unloaded an
aerial to a wide-open John Donnelly. who
caught the ball at the 20 and ran untouch-
ed into the endzone.

“That's a play where l’m isolated one
on one with a linebacker." said Donnelly.
“But nobody picked me. l was wide
open."

The Danes faked the extra-point try and
kicker Dave Lincoln ran it in for 2 points.

The ﬁnal Albany score came at the start
of the fourth quarter following a Wayne
Andersen interception that put the ball on
the Cortland 28. The big play in that drive
was a Haynor l5 yard run on a reverse
pitch.

The drive culminated on a 3-yard rollout
pass to Scott Barker for the score.

Coach Ford put in second-string An-
thony Nozzi to complete the game as the
Danes were content their 28-0 advantage.

Meanwhile Ruyack was having no suc- -
ccss moving the offense. He was under a
rush all day. and completed 8 of 28 passes
before being relieved in the fourth quarter
by Lilliam Murphy. ‘

Jim Valentino once again was all over
the field. accumulating9 solo tackles and 5
assists.

Paw Prints: Albany State is now 3-0
against Division lll schools and 0-3 vs.
Division ll squads this season...Next week
the Danes travel to Vermont to face Nor-
wich University. a Division lll school.

“The big teams are getting all
the exposure. and my team is be-
ing shortchanged," he charged.
adding. “That's just not fair to
my players."

“Numerous, less-prominent in-
stitutions with ﬁne football pro-
grams are now essentially shut out
of any significant participation in
the market for television," Toner
said. creating a “panorama of
diminishing opportunity."

Even Boston College, which
last year earned over $1.5 million
in four TV appearances, this year
must appear eight times to make
5750.000, according to BC head
football coach Jack 'Bicknell.

The new conﬂicts. moreover,
have colleges suing one another
over which teams will appear on
which network under whose TV
contract.

UCLA, Souther Cal, the Big 10
and Pac 10. are suing ABC
because it won't allow CFA
members to appear on CBS when
they play against USC and UCLA
this fall.

The CFA “has offered com-
promises to get the games on
TV,” insisted CFA spokesman
Dick Snyder. “but we can’t abort
our contract with ABC."

Unitl the suit is decided,
schools with different TV con-
tracts may not be able to televise
their games, critics say.

Others can’t even get TV
contracts.

“We checked with the net-
works, Turner Broadcasting.
ESPN, you name it. and none of
them have any intention of cover-
ing" lesser-known college games.
said Jim Delany. commissioner of
the Ohio Valley Conference.
which consists of Division ll
schools.

Consequently, Ohio Valley
members - will lose “between
$400.000 and 3600.000" in TV
revenues this fall. Delany said.

The vchaos has made many
sports ofﬁcials ready to bring
back the NCAA as their exclusive
negotiating agent.

“i think we‘re all giving the
NCAA more credit" than it got a
year ago. said WSUls Walden. “I
hope we can come up with some
new plan that would allow the
NCAA to get us out of this for

El

 

next year."

Boaters loss

The women's soccer team suffered
their eighth defeat in 10 games as the
Danes fell to Springfield. 6-2 on
Saturday.

Five minutes into the game, starting
goaltender Maureen Keller injured her
middle finger, forcing her out of the
game. in her place went Kathy DiBen-
nedeto. who started her first collegiate
game last Sunday against St. Lawrence
in a losing effort.

DiBennedeto hadn’t planned on play-
ing against Springfield, as she felt sick
before the game. Her illness affected
her play, as Springfield scored four
goals within five minutes. They added
another goal late in the first half. mak-
ing the score 5-0 at halftime.

The Danes got on board in the second
half as Joanna Lazaridcs converted a
Sue Frost pass 22:10 into the second
ltalf. Albany closed out the scoring as

three games with three minutes left to
play in the game.

college football season and a new era in
televised college sports began, many cam-
pus ofﬁcials were already complaining
theirlprograms were losing money.

Thanks largely to a series of bitter
lawsuits, battles with television networks
and. ultimately. the June, l984 U.S.
Supreme Court decision to let individual
schools and conferences negotiate their
own TV contracts. the l984 season could
start an era in which football superpowers
permanently eclipse the rest of the nation’s
programs. officials said.

Many already are urging a return to the
old days of 1983.

“it’s a disaster from an economic stand-

point." lamented Tom Hansen, commis-
sioner of the Pacific Athletic Conference
(Pac 10). whose 10 members will gain lit-
tle, if anything. from the new TV
situation.
__ “it's obvious there isn't the money out
there that there was-last year," added
UCLA sports department spokesman
Mark Dellins. “it will take more ap-
pearances for less money to match last
year." he said.

“it's caused the NCAA (National Col-
legiate Athletic Association) and all of us a
big mess," agreed Jim Walden, head foot-
ball coach at Washington State University
(WSU).

The I‘mess" arose from 1982 lawsuit
against the NCAA, which for 32 years had
negotiated TV contracts for all college
football games.

Two years ago the universities of
Oklahoma dn Georgia sued the NCAA.
claiming individual schools had the right
to say when, where, and for what price
their football teams will appear on TV.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June
that the NCAA’s exclusive control over
football TV rights was, indeed. an illegal

 

monopoly.

f Colleges getr'aw TV Ideal,

‘(cotuzoiz mess SERVICE) As the regular ' Now individual schools — or stones}???

 

schools like the Pae l0 and Big l0 can;
ferences ‘—‘ frantically are negotiating their
own deals with major networks, cable,
systems. and regional TV’ stations. Md

most observers fear that when the dust '

ﬁnally settles few teams will be better off
than under the NCAA’s voided TV plaii.

“if everything goes right. we’ll come
close to breaking even" with last year. said
the Pac 10’s Hansen. ’

Nationwide, colleges will lose about $4l‘
million in TV money this year, accordin,
to NCAA President John Toner.

“I think our members are feeling at
economic crunch" as a result of the net
TV plan, NCAA spokesman Dav!
Cawood added.

Toner estimates colleges this year wi:‘
make only about half the $78 million in T‘
revenues they would have made under tht
old NCAA arrangement.

in a kind of exclusive, upper crust ver-
sion of the NCAA, the College Football
Association (CFA) — comprised of 63 ma-
jor football powers — recently negotiated
a $21 million deal to have ABC broadcast
its games.

I The Pac 10 and Big 10 conferences have
likewise signed a SIO million deal to broad«
cast 16 games over CBS.

Other schools — lacking the clout and
popularity of the CFA. Pac l0 and Big 10
teams — are signing contracts with TV sta-
tions and cable networks to broadcast their
games regionally.

WSU. for instance, will earn about
$600,000 in regionaly TV revenues this
year. said coach Walden, $200,000 less
than last year.

And worse, Walden added. because the
superpower teams have scheduled most of
the prime network TV time. “we have no
room to get on (national) TV even if we do
great later in the season."
