Iran launches attack

I r ‘ Iran
(AP) Iran announced an offensive against

Iraq in the mountains east of Baghdad
Thursday. and Iraq said it repulsed the at-

tacking Iranians when they tried to cross.

February, when Iraq said the Iranians lost
50.000 soldiers in an abortive attempt to
occupy southern iraq's‘Huwaizah marsh
and isolate the port city of Basra. V

-However. there was no statement by
Iran to indicate that its asttacks marked
the beginning of its long-expected “final
offensive" to end the war. launched four
years ago by Iraq to regain the rights to
several disputed land and water border
areas.

g free one of the convicted robbers in the

1981 Brink’s armored car robbery — were
arrested early Thursday. officials said.
The nine were arrested in pre-dawn

~ Laster, assistant director in charge of the

New York FBI ofﬁce.

Forty one college campuses
across twenty seven states will be
tied-together November 6, elec-
tion night, by a student radio net-

SUNYA’s WCDB-9IFM.

They’ll be offering a unique
angle of coverage. beginning at‘

towards student concerns and

This is the second time WCDB

will head ENCN for presidential
election coverage, said
Chonigman.

In 1980, 15 other universities
were involved. covering a much
smaller area as compared to the
4| universities across 27 different
states participating this year.

“Stations will be calling in at 90
minute intervals to give reports,"
said Chonigman, “we can then

provide‘

v ‘feedthem information that we’ve

recieved from other stations,” he
explained.

“Obviously we can't compete:

with the major networks." said
Gronich,“but what we can do is
approach the elections from a dif-
ferent direction.”

, Gronich. a SUNYA alumni,
said campus” news staffs will share
reports oriented towards students
concerns. including analysis and
commentary by political experts
at colleges and universities.

-“We'll be getting input from
the education community, people
the major networks don't usually
interview," such as professors
and student leaders, said
Chonigman.

WCDB will use the student
association offices as head-
quarters for the network, with
about twenty people answering
phones there throughout the
night, said Chonigman.

“In 1980 we sent people to par-
ty headquarters in New York and
Washington,”
“This year we have stations there
and we don't have to do that." he
noted.

Chonigman said he is not sure
exactly how much the network is

figures between $300 and $500.

Bush attacked on ‘salt y’remarks, manhood issue.

(AP) In a little more than a week. Vice
President George Bush’s campaign has
become filled with charges about salty
remarks, accusations about shame,
demands for apologies. and now.’ com-
ments about his manhood.

Meanwhile Geraldine Ferraro is using
her campaign appearances the rest of the
week to turn up the heat in her criticism of
President Reagan’s foreign policy and set
the stage for Walter F. Mondale’s con-
frontation with Reagan on Sunday.

The strange agenda of issues has emerg-
ed in what had been a low-key campaign
up until Bush’s debate last Thursday with
Ferraro.

Ever since that encounter. Bush has
been trading fire with Mondale and his
running mate, Ferraro, about his com—
ments both in the debate and afterwards.

Peter Tcelcy, press secretary to the vice
president, said Wednesday he was not
disturbed by the odd twist of
developments.

“We are very surprised that the
Mondale-Ferraro campaign would waste
five days byﬂthrowing bombs at, us,”
Teelcy said.

Bush. whose fatnily nickname is “Pep-.:. ~

py,” seems to be relishing the sudden new
attention he has received since offering this
post-debate assessment: “We tried to kick
a little ass last night."

Calling attention to the controversy.
Bush opened a foreign policy address
Wednesday by saying that he and his wife
Barbara “have been washing our mouths
out with soap ever since" he made his off-
color remark and his wife called Ferraro

, something that rhymes with "rich."

More thah 90 percent of SUNYA’s
undergrads didn't vote in Monday and

tions in which a $6.50 increase in the
yearly mandatory student activity fee
was approved and 32 new student

representatives were

elected. central
Beginning next

semester, students will Council

pay $99 per year for the
mandatory student ac-
tivity fee. The extra $6.50 to be col-
lected from each student each year will
be split between SA funded groups and
campus athletics. with $3.50 going to
the groups. and $3 for athletic funding,
according to SA Controllor Richie
Golubow.

The elections drew 910 voters to the
polls. with 547 students favoring a fee
increase and 363 opposing it.

The fee hike will raise SA’s yearly
budget from $92,000 to $98,175.

SA President Rich Schaffer said that.
although SA is now in the black for the
first time in three years. the extra
money was needed “to cover the

SA was on very tight budget last year,
and had to reduce both the number of
groups it funded and the budgets of
those it did fund. ,

SA ofﬁcials cited student apathy as
one reason for the low’ elections
turnout.

“For a fall election, we usually get
1,200 (students). so it was a little off."
said Schaffer, explaining that apathy
probably has a part to do with it. a lot

unfortunate.”

SA Elections Commissioner Dave
Light explained. “In fall elections very

much more involved than in the fall."

two have resigned.

spring for the position of SA President.

with 57 of the 128 votes cast in that
race. McCann also won a close race for
the only open University Senate’seat,

Teelcy, asked why Bush keeps referring 
to his off-color remark. said, “We were‘
just trying to laugh off the issue. They’re '

' (Democrats) trying to make it a serious

one.”
In the debate. Bush also said that Mon-

.dale and Ferraro had suggested that;

immediately that they had never said that,
and Mondale demanded an apology.

When Bush refused, Mondale said. “He

doesn't have an answer and he doesn't
have the manhood to apologize."
I Asked about Mondale's charge, Bush.
in a somewhat confusing answer. replied.
“I'll lay my record on any forum.
whatever it is, on the manhood up against
his. ['11 just leave it at that."

While responding to questions at a
citizens‘ forum in Portland on Wednes-
day, the vice president was challenged
repeatedly on U.S. policy in Nicaragua
and drew loud boos from some people on
U.S. policy about nuclear war.

Denying an assertion by a women that
U.S. policy says a nuclear war could be
won, Bush said, “Our policy is a nuclear
war is not winnable and must not be
fought."

When the vice president was challenged
by someone else on the same point, Bush
snapped. “I just answered it. I answered it

Ferraro was scheduled to make a foreign
policy address Thursday at the University
of Washington. She'was also scheduled to
deliver a speech on nuclear arms control
Saturday at the University of
Massachusetts.

Both speeches are aimed at appealing to
young voters to back the Detnocratic
ticket. but the emphasis is on Reagan’s
foreign policy. which the Democrats say
has failed.

“We want to leave the week on a foreign
policy note," and lead into the Sunday
debate between Mondale and Reagan, :gid

World hunger problems addressed

By Allc‘la Clmbora

EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

As most SUNYA students were out on the podium Tuesday enjoying the sun, the pro-
blems of hunger were being addressed at World Food Day. But People and Foods Presi-
dent Mary Robinson said the event pulled a “disappointing” turnout.

World Food Day was an all day event held in LC 19 intended to educate people about
hunger. The event was run by People and Food, an SA funded group dedicated to raising

h unger 8W8 I'CIICSS.

A large part of World Food Day was conducted via a live satellite teleconference from
Washington. Television and movie personality Eddie Albert delivered an introduction
and acted as moderator of the teleconference.

A panel of hunger experts, including U.S. Department of Agriculture and Secretary
John Bloch and Ruth Finney of the Food and Agriculture Organization, conducted a
question and answer period where questions regarding world hunger could be phoned In.

Robinson expressed disappointment at the poor turnout. saying that there were no
more than 15 people in attendance at any time. “Hunger is not a big rallying point," she
said, “but even though it doesn't make headlines, hunger affects more than 800 million

people in the world every day."

JSC-Hillel adviser Jay Kellman. and Catholic chaplains Jack Molyn and Nancy
Lenghart of SUNYA's Chapel House ran the closing ceremonies and offered positive
