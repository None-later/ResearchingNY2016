Students should educate
themselves on issues and then get
out the vote. instead ofjust sitting
around and talking about it.
declared NYPIRG Local Board
Chairperson Phil D'Elia.

D’Elia. who spoke at the New
York Public Interest Research
Group Activism Forum Wednes-
day night, said that, "rather than
just going in there (polls) and
voting Democratic Row A"
straight across the board.
students should become ac-
quainted with the different can-
didates, and make an informed
choice.

Speakers called voter registra-
tion "the first step." Students
were urged to “Take the Next
Step" and become more political-
ly involved and informed at the
forum.

The forum, which attracted HO
people. was organized “to
demonstrate the vitality of stu-
dent activism and the important
role college students are playing
in shaping the future.” according
to D'Elia.

"People say that the student
movement is dead." said D’Elia.
“because we’re not doing protests
or sit-ins about war. There’s no
war going on."

Activism is “more
sophisticated" now than it was

Next Step." followed NYPIRG's
'voter registration drive which
ended on October 4th and
registered 5.500 new student
voters in the Albany area.

The forum addressed the need
for students to "take the next
step" beyond voter registration
by becoming more “informed
and involved" in the political pro-
cess. according to D'Elia.

The pervading theme at the
forum was student involvement.
“You've already started by com-
ing here," Meyer announced.

“There was a lot of energy
there." D'Elia said. “no people
showed up in the middle of the
semester. and about 80 percent
stayed around and went to all the
projects“ that NYPIRG ran after
the fortttn to further educate the
voters.

NYPIRG is planning to hold
workshops. discussions. and

to involvement is in educating the
students. particularly in consumer
affairs, because consumer issues
“don’t have the glamour" that
other issues have. By educating
and informing students of the op—
tions, she said. students are “able
to make a choice."

Both D’Elia and Meyer discuss-
ed the evolution of NYPIRG.
D’Elia recounted how NYPIRG
progressed from "six students
hanging out wondering what they
could do." to a group inﬂuential

Meyer also discussed some of

voters throughout the state.

After an introduction by

Comity seeking SUNYA funds to go nationwide

By Allcla Clmbora
EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

Comity, SUNYA's International Affairs
magazine, may realize its goal of expan-
ding nationwide if its staff get the funds
they want from the University. but they
may have to wait a while for their request
to be considered.

The magazine is seeking funding from
the international Committee of Educa-
tional Research and Development. which
falls ttndcr the jurisdiction of Vice Presi-
dent of Research and Graduate Studies.
John Schumaker.

Although it currently has no steady
financial source. the magazine’s editor‘in-
chief Brian Jacobs said. “We want to set
up a financial base and hope that that will
attract additional funding."

The costs of producing Comity are
presently absorbed partly through local
advertising and partly through paid
subscriptions, said Jacobs.

According to the International Commit-
tee’s chair, Joseph Zachek, his group’s
purpose is “to unify the international
elements of the SUNYA campus." The
committee suggests to Schumaker specific
financial allocations to meet their goals.
Zachek said.

Zachek said that since the committc is
new this semester, it will be a while before
Comity's request for funding is actually
discussed, bill “it will be one of the first
items of business."

Zachck stressed that he couldn't predict
the outcome of the request “because it's a
committee decision." but he said, “I‘m

 

One of Albany's most unique
features is the diversity of organizations
attracted by the legislature and the
many events that these groups sponsor.

This Friday and Saturday, En-
vironmental Planning Lobby, the
state's only full-time environmental
lobbying organization will hold its an-
nual convention at the Thruway House,
which is just a short walk across
Washington Avenue from State and
Colonial Quads.

The convention's highlight will come
Saturday afternoon at 1:45, when New
York’s Attorney General. Robert
Abrams. receives the 1984 Environmenv
talist of the Year Award and addresses
the convention.

“Basically he's just been aggressively
enforcing environmental laws." said
EPL's Executive Director. Judith Enck.
She added that Abrams received the
award because he is “the lending state-
wide public official who works for en-
viromncntal issues."

Friday at 8:30 p.m. Gus Spcth. presi-
dent of the World Resources lnstitue
will discuss global cnvirontnental issues
such as land preservation and pollution.
Speth also served as chair of the Coun-
cil on Environmental . ‘Qlllililyh a.
presidential advisory'gr’o'up. during the

 

Environmental conference slated

Carter administration.

The convention, which requires a
$5.00 registration fee. will also include
workshops on hazardous waste
disposal. energy. parks policy. land use.
solid waste disposal. and training ses-
sions on lobbying and handling the
media. Anyone interested in attending
can register at the door.

Enck said about 300 people were ex-
pected. including college students from
SUNY-Buffalo. College of Saint Rose
in Albany. Union College. SUNY-
Oneonta. and NYU. She called the
yearly conference the "major en-
vironmental gathering in New
York."

EPL. Enck said. is a statewide ad-
vocacy coalition of organizations and
citizens. including Audubon Society,
the Adirondack Mountain Club. Clear-
water. the Environmental Defense
Fund. the League of Women Voters.
the National Resources Defense Con-
ference. and the Toxics in Your Corn-
munity Coalition.

Both the Sierra Club and the New
York Public Interest Research Group
(NYPIRG). will be sending delegates.
as well. even though neither sroupis af—
fillatcd with EPL. D

 

 

very impressed that a student enterprise
without systematic funding has produced
such a good quality" product.

He added that, although “university
resources are limited. I think the Universi-
ty — if it can — should give it a hand."

Comity's goal is to become a national
magazine on college campuses across the
country.

According to Jacobs, while the
magazine’s inﬂuence is mainly on this
campus, they have begun a statewide push
to gain recognition from other college
campuses in New York.

Jacobs said that he is not aware of any
publication like Comity on other college
campuses. Copy distribution at SUNY-
Binghamton, SUNY-StonyBrook,
Syracuse, Columbia and NYU began last
Inonth, Jacobs said.

Comin is distributed free at SUNYA
and is geared primarily toward students.
although there has recently been increased
support from faculty through paid
subscriptions. said Jacobs. '

A subscription costs $3 per semester. but
the subscriptions from professors are
“more a show of support for the magazine

than financial support." Jacobs said.

Other backers of the magazine include
the Deans of Humanities, Public Affairs
and Social Sciences departments. who each
contributed money to the production of a
recent isSUe. Jacobs said.

Comity, which presently has a circula-
tion of l0.000. was founded in December
of I983. “We started from scratch and the
magazine had to develop its own credibili-
ty. All things considcfed it worked pretty
quickly." Jacobs said. The magazine is a
publication of the Albany Student Press
Corporation.

If they receive funding. Comity‘s staff is
hoping to set up an advisory board con-
sisting of distinguished national and inter-
national professors to "help establish
more crcdibiltiy." said Jacobs.

“We have the opportunity to do
something very innovative — to bring even
more prestige to the University." Jacobs
said. He added that he hopes the commit-
tcc “will consider the strong support of the
faculty" in making their decision as to the
extent of funding.

“At some point the moral support of
this campus has to turn to financial sup-
port." Jacobs said.
