As future social workers, Masters in
Social Welfare (MSW) students plan on
facing lots of red tape during their careers.
They got a sneak preview of this
bureaucratic problem last Wednesday
afternoon at a meeting of MSW students,
administration. and faculty. .

The goal was to discuss. and possibly
solve. the School of Social Welfare’s
(SSW) recent controversial revision of the
MSW program. However. at its end.
students were left virtually unsatisﬁed.
“We haven’t come up with anything new
at this meeting." said one student.

The MSW program revision included
the removal of a two credit course from
the required course list, and the addition
of one credit to the two credit Field in-
struction l course. This was done so that
students would be able to satisfy the 60
credit graduation requirement.

Although the two credit course was
dropped this year, Field Instruction 1 is not
going to beworth three credits until fall of
1985. leaving this year's students with the
possibility of being one credit behind at
graduation time.

Associate Dean John Oliver explained
the reasons for these changes, saying the
two credit course was dropped from the
program because the administration felt
the series of required courses was “ex-

hausting" to the students.

The students caught in the transition
period between the two and three credit
Field Instruction course said they had a
serious problem in obtaining just one. more
credit, as no one credit courses are of fered.

They requested to meet with Oliver and
Dr. .Ron Tosner. Chairman of the Cur-
riculum Committee. to address the pro-
blem. Wednesday's meeting was theresult
of their request.

According to Larry McGrath, a member
of the Graduate Student Committee, they
had perviously discussed the problems
among themselves, and with the Graduate
Student Union. Vice President of
Academic Affairs Judith Ramaley. and
Student Association Attorney Mark
Mishler were also consulted, he said.

Vince Marrone. a representative of the
Social Welfare Student Committee,
presented Oliver with letters and petitions
from students who were unable to attend.
“Our goal today is to work together and to
be able to work hand in hand with the ad-
ministration to solve this problem," he
said.

Oliver first explained the process any
policy change has to go through. Changes
are first discussed among the Curriculum
and Education Policy Committee, which
includes both students and faculty
members. If approved, it is sent to the
Dean of the School.

academic requirements. If it is, the dean
appoints a designee who presents the idea

need to graduate.

He said students can take two credit

SSW and other departments. or obtain
