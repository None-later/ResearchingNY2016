,By Noam-Eshkar

‘.'At the risk of federal pr‘oséCution,
members of the Albany Friends Meeting
House have been providing sanctuary since
late September for two Salvadoran
refugees. Both are illegal aliens. ’

According to Ellen Flanders. secretary
of the Sanctuary Committee for the
Albany Friends Meeting, Pedro Ramos, a
journalist and a member. of an indepen-
dent Human Rights Commission, and his
wife Sylvia. fled from political persecution
in El Salvador. and have been staying in
the meeting house since September.

The house, she said, is part of a national
network of over 150 churches. and
synagogues that provide sanctuary for
Central American refugees.'The network
was begun in I982 and has grown quickly

sanctuary activity to the underground
railroad that helped blacks escape from the
South during slavery.

Ramos has been very visible, holding
press conferences and interviews, since his
arrival in Albany.

He has spoken of repression and brutali-
ty under the U.S. backed Salvadoran
government and has been highly critical of
U.S. foreign policy.

His wife, Sylvia Ramos. has not allowed
herself to be photographed publicly
because of the danger to relatives still liv-
ing in El Salvador.

The immigration department, according
to ofﬁcer Henry Brattlie, is “not going to
get involved during the heat of the hour 'in
an emotional media event."

“I'm not saying we won't get to him."
Brattlie continued, but understafﬁng and

recent trouble with banana boat

he said.

Since 1979. about 40,000 civilians in El
Salvador have been killed and at least
500,000 have ﬂed the country according to
Church ofﬁcials.

The immigration department added that
there are now 22.314 asylum applicants
from El Salvadorans pending in the
Federal Courts. In I982, I4.078"illegal
Salvadorans were arrested and 4.883 of
those were expelled.

“We are aware that our government has
declared that aiding such refugees is
against the law." said Flanders adding that
the Society of Friends has notiﬁed the'At-
torney General that they are harboring il-
legal aliens and they are willing to go to
jail. if necessary. to protect the sanctuary
system.

Brattlie. however, said. “They have
made public assertions that he is an illegal
alien, but we have no documentation of ‘
that fact." '

The Department of Immigration is not

likely to get any documentation soon
,because, Brattlie explained. “I have three
.investigators to cover 20 counties in my
jusisdiction. Our number one priorities are
with criminal aliens. Murderers, muggers .

' the apprehension of people like that has

such a more important societal imqu
than, say, apprehending a dish-washer."

The Immigration Department does not
apprehend non-criminal aliens in chur.
ches. schools or private residences unless u
search warrant is issued. Brattlie said ,ad_
ding that most apprehensions are made at
places of employment.

To the best of his knowledge, Bran“.-
said, no church officials or Central
American aliens have been apprehended in
a church sanctuary. However, he said, a
few Americans have been prosecuted for
transporting aliens to sanctuaries.

Brattlie disputed the Church's Claims
that other nationals get sanctuary while
Salvadorans do not, by citing statistics that
indicated that the proportion of
Salvadorans expelled was comparable to
the proportion of Polish nationals expell-
ed. The U.S. has openly committed itself
to the assistance of Polish refugees.

In I980, Congress adopted United Nu-
tions Protocol on Refugees, which grants
asylum to nationals who cannot' return to
their homelands for fear of persecution
because of their ideological beliefs. Tlte
U.S. will now grant asylum to refugees
who show “well—grounded fears that they
will be persecuted in their home country on
the basis of race, religion. political activi.
ty, or because of membership in a group,"
Brattlie said. i '

New lights to cut SUN YA energy bill by $30, 000

’ By Barbara Abrahamer

The incandescent lighting in the
SUNYA" biasenierits “of "buildings
on the academic podium will be
replaced next semester with
ﬂourescent lights to save SUNYA
approximately $30,000 a year in
energy costs.

According to Facilities
Engineer Charles Estey. the base-
ment corridor lights will be
replaced probably starting
January. and at a cost of approx-
imately Sl00,000. Bids are being
accepted until November 14, he
added.

The funds will be taken from
the SUNYA Maintenance and
Repair budget. Estey said. which
SUNY Central allocated for
speciﬁc projects.

lead to a reduction in energy
usage. less maintenance. and
possible savings of $30,000 per
year. he said. adding that it
“seemed like a relatively easy job
that wouldn't offend anyone."

Estey said that
about how to avoid disturbing
classes held in the basement had
not yet taken place. but one
possibility was to have as much of
the work as possible completed
during intersession break in
January. “It‘ll be one of the first
things we talk to the contractor
about," he promised.

Accordittg to Estey. incandes-
cent lights draw about 300 watts
of current while ﬂourescent lights
draw only abpout l00 watts. He
added that although the incandes-
cent lights are decorative, they
“don't give off a lot of light and
they use a lot of electricity.“

Estey said maintenanca costs
were a major factor in the deci-
sion to install the new lights. He

discussions f

explained that incandescent lights
have a' life span'of only about
2.000 hours. but ﬂourescent lights
can last as long as I6,000 hours.
Estey said he foresees a decrease
in the need for workers to replace
lights from two or three times at
year to about once every two
years.

The halls of upper levels in the
academic buildings are not
scheduled for any lighting
changes in the near future.
Although the upper Floors also
have incandescent hall lighting.

Van Grol tens What’s wrong "I

with U.S. politics, business

By Rick Swanson
l‘tJl‘l'URlAl. ASSISTANT

When Brian Van Grol. collected for
UNICEF as a child, he was told that every
25 cents collected would
save 25 children from cat- '
ching colds, and he thought Fr'day
this was good. Prome

But when Brian Van Grol
grew up. he was told that the world’s
military budget would spend the UNICEF
budget in only four hours, and he was not
pleased.

Van Grol’s bright red hair. sharp
features, and flamboyant style of dress are
as unusual on this campus as his politics.

Van Grol, a SUNYA student and a
Democratic Socialist. often wonders about
the world's economic and social condi-
tions. and wonders how he can help
remedy them. He doesn't like what he sees.
and hopes to change thittgs by educating
people. especially about the oppression of
the lower classes.

An example of oppression. Van Grol
said. is the way U.S. business people buy
grain from farmers at a low price and sell it
on the market at a large profit. Third
World countries who cannot afford to pur-
chase the grain at these inﬂated prices, ac~
cording to Van Grol. must go without the
food.

Van Grol sees this as greed. and, decor-
ding lo him, greed motivates business peo-
ple of all types to conduct business in a
cold, callous manner. strictly for profit.
and seldom for altruism.

“Creed is not a proper incentive for
moving society forward.” said Van Grol.
noting that most of the wealth in the U.S.
has been amassed by only a few people.

“A lot of the amount of wealth coming
ittto this country is from exploiting people
from other parts of the world." said Van
Grol. itt his distinctive Rochester uccént.

U.S. business people drain wealth from
poorer countries. Vun Grol asserted, by
purchasing minerals from tltc earth (i.c.
gold. colbalt. diamonds) at a small cost.
and then selling the minerals on the market
for a large profit. According to Vnn Grol,
this is ttot fair to those who tnincd the land
at low wages to prodttcc these minerals.

“I believe that the minerals of the earth,
the raw materials of the earth belong to the
people of the earth.“ said Van Grol. Innin-
tnining that all that comes from the earth

News Updates

Confidentiality urged

Central Council recently made a
resolution that a student‘s choice of
S/U grading should be confidential bet-
ween the student and the registrars
office.

The present policy is that instructors
are informed which students have opted
for S/U grading. which could lead to
concious or unconcious discrimination
against these students.

SA is supporting a system where in-
structors will assign all students A-E
grades and the registrar will make the
cltangc to S/U where appropriate.

The resolution urges the University
Senate and the registrars office to adopt
this policy.

Ugly students data

At Indiana University of Petiti-
sylvnnia. the homecoming queen. Kllllc
Ncihold, will show up for the
homecoming parade with a bag over her
head nnd it is said that the queen and
her blind tltttc. lirucc Morgan, will be
ugly enough to stop trztl'l‘ic. according
to it Times Union article.

Morgan and Ncihold are the winners
of n contest to pick the ugliest collcgc
man and woman itt America. Their date
is intended to raise money for the fami-

 

should be shared. not hoarded up by the
wealthy.

Van Grol‘s outlook on the U.S. is not
bleak. however.

He said he believes that once people ac-
tually see the oppression in the world. they
will be tnore willing to change the poor
conditions. As of now, though. the op-
pression still goes on in underdeveloped
countries. and “people just don't look at
that." said Van Grol.

The Democratic Socialists of America.
an organization within the Democratic
party. hopes to bring about changes in-
society by peaceful means, through the
channels of government and bureaucracy.
said Van Grol, citing DSA members
already within the government.

“Creed is not a proper incentive. "

Van Grol said. however. that change
cannot come about througlt legislation.
When blacks were freed from slavery. ltc
said. they were still as poor as ever; when
women were given suffrage, they still had
little chance to hold public office; and
ttgnin, when blacks were givctt civil rights
in the (i0s. discritninutimt kept tltctn from

Socialism in North America differs. he
