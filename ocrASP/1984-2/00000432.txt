Plagued by a constantly in-
creasing pile of paperwork. Stu-
dent Association officials found
themselves. faced with two
choices: either be completely
buried under files, letters. bills.
proposals. and other documents
or spend $3,095 on a. new
microfilm system. They chose the
latter.

Central Council allocated the
funding for the system during its
summer meeting at Camp
Dippikill.

No one is exactly sure when the
new microfilm system will be in
operation or even when it will be
installed.

The problem with setting an in-
stallation date, according to SA
Media Director Stacey Young, is
that the SA files ltave to be
“weedcd out”. Much of the
material tnust be reclassified, and
ttot all of the material in the files
will be kept, she said.

Of the $3,095 allocated to the
project, $1,595 is being spent to
purchase a reader, along with a
printer to make paper copies of
the information when necessary.
The remaining $1.500 will be
spent putting back records on to
microfilm. explained SA Presi-
dent Suzy Auletta.

included on the films will be in-
formation about past SA ac-
tivities. rallies. and events which

student group leaders will be able
to access for further information.
Auletta said.

SA has not yet actually bought
the equipment. Young said. and
will not do so until the files are
ready to be put on microfilm.

SA's present filing system is'

messy and inefficient, according
to Rita Levine, director of opera-
tions for SA. she added that the
installation of the microfilm
system will dramatically cut down
on the space needed to store the
files. Right now, she explained.
the files take up a great deal of
space.

Young said that some informa-
tion must be kept for a certain
number of years and can then be
discarded. All correspondences.
sch said for example, must be
kept for two years. By filing all of
last year’s ‘respondcnce on one
film, the information can be
discarded all together when SA no
longer needs it.

The microfilm site said. “will
help us not only use our records.
it will help tts maintain our
records."

By using the tnicrofilm, Levine
said. SA is less likely to lose im-
portant records. and can also be
run tnore efficiently.

Auletta said the system is im-
portant for administrative pur-
poses. “It‘s one of the best ideas
we‘ve come up with in a while.
We're improving our office struc-

ture," she said. Neither Young
nor Auletta would predict how
long it would take to put the
microfilm in operation.

Auletta said she hopes the
system will be in use soon. “Right
now we’tre working on getting so-
meone who can organize data."
she said. Once that is completed,
she noted, the films will be
available in the SA office to all
students.

the system is ready, she added.

The microfilm - idea was
originally Young's. Auletta said.
and the project will be under her
jurisdiction.

However, Auletta added, there
will be no increase in Young’s sti-
pend, because. "There, will be
some extra work, but no more

undertaken." ;

SA’s new system will not be the
only one on campus. University
Libraries already stores back
issues of many publications on
microﬁlm. Also, just last year.

storing its records on miocrofilm
