I can’t dance. .

I can listen well, though.

And lately, what 1 find myself
spending most of my time listen-
ing to are local bands; bands at
$288 Lark when I can get there,
bands on vinyl when I can find:
the record. But local music.

Why? Well, partly because this
Long Island boy finds a certain ap-
peal in the Capital District's musi-
cians — enough of one to turn a

rabid Verge fan. _

Frightening, isn’t it?

Partly because there's a certain
appeal to live music; or to a
record, when you know that this

street at any time. It might depend
on how you handle Albany itself;
those who loveJhe city will find it
easy enough to begin to like, de-
fend, and support the local bands
—— the music is such an integral
part of the city that it seems to in-
spire loyalty.

Likewise, those SUNY-ites who
hate Albany will find it just as
easy to be disdainful of the music,
to sneer at Capitle and the Plague
and then go back to listening to
Huey Lewis and John Cougar
Mellancamp.  - I

t’s tough going to see Lou Reed

these days, it really is. Like the

radio advertisement says: "It’s been
a long time since Lou Reed shook us upside
down with Transformer...it's been too
long. ” Exactly.

Reed’s show at the Palace Theatre last
night proved how long it's actually been,
not just since Transformer, but since I 969
and the Velvet Underground. Reed mat-
tered because he brought, as Lester Bangs
put it, "Dignity, Poetry, and Rock-n-Roll
to smack, speed, homosexuality,
sadomasochism, murder, perversity,
suicide, and destructive passivity.” But
more importantly he brought it to a world
in upheaval, a generation of open (if naive)
minds ready to experiment and embrace

' the different, the new, the intense; ready to
get involved.

The crowd: a wholesome staple of
painter's-cap collegians balanced off by a
motley crew of post-punk-nco-psuedo~
Beat-Bowie intellectuals. Leatherskirted
just-think-about-it legs strut past why-am-l-
here stares on l-know better-but-don't-care
faces bobbing nervously from seat, to

' bathroom, to water-fountain; to girlfriend.

"Oh Hi, yeah, they suck, yeah.”

"Hey, who forgot the bong?"

"lt's okay, I brought a frisbee."

Ex-hippie biker-earring types (Hell's
Angels meets the Beaver) glint tough-eyed
bare-chested at the crowd, their chubby
friends bloating plaintivcly nearby, lapping
up scraps of confidence. Short guys flex
baby biceps in leather vests ("Oli, geez,

. should I be a skinhead or a biker, damn")
while quiet middle-aged couples nod
knowingly: "Yes, we were reading Bur~
roughs at Berkeley, of course.”
I ain't even gonna count the Jordache Jean-
er. She bobs her ass off-time like the Ar-
chies at Pop's and her vacant eyes wander,
checking out the makeup and clothes. Ex-
pressionless, emotionless, feels neither
pleasure nor pain. Feels a Cadillac though,
or a rabbit-fur coat or a house in the
suburbs ("Wow, big dorm bash when we
get back, I gotta get to a ladies’ room").

 

 

 

Good thing I was smart enough to show

 

their interest too, or else picking

up and moving to more
hospitable areas. Fear Of
Strangers (a band, to my
everlasting regret, before my

time) once considered the pick of

ter is considering a move to the ci-
ty; and the Plague, I’ve been told,
has broken up also.
It’s pretty depressing —
especially when you can’t dance,
either.
Anyway, that's what this
dancing, but local music.
Spotlighted in the centerfold
(which kicks‘ off what will
hopefully 'be a series of articles
spotlighting local bands) are
French Letter, a band of old
Albany veterans that contributed
a cut to the Live At 288 album,
and have made a few carts for
WCDB; and Kilgore Trout, a new
and slightly undefinable band
who’ve just hit Albany, and are
looking to make their fortunes
here.
There'll‘be more articles on
local bands coming, too, so just
read. ‘ 'l '

Enjoy, a 
ll's easier than dancing, no?

Reed Walks. The MildSi‘. tie  V.

up after the warm-up band. Caught the last
strains of a cheap cover ofa wimpy Billy
Idol song. A band from Atlanta, Georgia.
(Athens? No, Atlanta.)

Lou opens with Sweet-lane, a sure thing,
but right away I can tell the band is off.
timing and vocals are too heavy,
ponderous.

The band's looking old and greasy, like
sixties leftovers. But Lou looks fit and
muscular in black leather pants and black
T-shirt, he looks good. Too good. Where’s
the pale aura of heroin? The stink of
transvestitism?

Some classics: I’m Waiting for The Man,
Sally Can't Dance, Walk on the Wild Side
,,(thank God he didn't save it for the en-
core), Street Hassle, Satellite of Love,
White Light, White Heat (a very good ver-
sion), and Coney Island Baby (a great, great
version). The guitars are good-Robert
Quine(lead) and Fernando Saunders(bass)
from the Live in Italy album- but the drum-
Iner’s only got one beat, you know: whum-
pa, whumpa, whumpa. so if the song hap-
pens to fit the beat, it sounds good. lf it
doesn't fit the beat, it sounds bad. Crowd

doesn’t give a shit what it sounds like
anyway:

"Yeah Lou! Alright! Yeah! Lou! Yeah!"

"Hey, why issen he wearin’ shades? lt’s
nightime."

"Yeah! Lou! Yeah!"

The problem was that Reed's
iconoclastic brand of hypnotic decadence
was doomed to fade. The archetype he
created was eventually buried by the in-
evitable onslaught of imitators, the worst
of which was Reed himself.

To his credit, Reed eventually
discovered the possibilities behind his
Velvet scenarios and set out to explore‘;_
.‘hern. The best of thelater- albums- delve in-
to things that matter, that always Iiave:
friendship and fear; the glory of love that
can get you through (to use his own
words); and the. rediscovery of dead
dreams that were never really alive in the
first place, hurting more the second time
than they did the first. Reed’s prophetic
power as Poet of the semi-dark nestled
with its bedfellows, perversity and sancti-
ty, and was reborn.
