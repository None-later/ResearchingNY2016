. ' hird world ‘caucus

To the Editor:

Y My name is Michael L. Edwards. 1 am a graduate stu-

dent at the State University of New York, College at
3Brockport. i am also the Chairman of the Third World
Caucus of SASU and Student Assembly. What’s that.
’1» nd so what?

" Well, the Third World Caucus is a state level student
’un organization. its intended purpose is to be an ad
ocate advisor and representative for people of colour
 ithin the SUNY systemuThe Third World Caucus is a
‘ ubdivision of two organizations; SASU, the Student

ssociation of the State University and the Student

. sscmbly.

. All sixty-four campuses within SUNY are members of
he Third World Caucus. That's right. your school is
.' lready a member school. This is because all schools are a
.. ember of Student Assembly. if your particular campus

a member of SASU, then you are a double member. All
ASU schools are automatically a member of the Third
orld Caucus. I

5y cruitment and retention, aparthied and corporate
' ivestment from South Africa. sensitizing faculty to
hnic differences, voter registration and developing
litical awareness.
Locally we can help campus Black Student Unions,
'n American Student Unions and international Stu-
cnt Associations with their relations with Student
' ssociations.
in essence, we are troubleshooters, problem busters.
. ou’ll find, if you participate. that the TWC can be very
neﬁcial to your campus. With Hispanic, Black and in-
rnational student leaders coming together, sharing pro-
cms, concerns, solutions and ideas. it becomes exciting
see what develops. This coupled with the support of
ASU and the Student Assembly makes the Third World
aucus an organization with the power to institute
ange.

Unjust committee

To the Editor:

Last year, as a member of State Quad Executive Board.
l was Editor of the State Quad Newsletter. One of the ar-
ticles i wrote last semester was on the controversy over
the illegal party run by Ross Abelow.

A recent ASP editorial admonished Central Council
for appointing Ross to a position on the U.A.S. Board of
Directors in light of that incident. For whatever reason.
Central Council decided to ignore Ross' past and gave
him the position.

i ﬁnd irony in the fact that having applied for a posi-
tion on University Student Judicial Committee, l was
denied even an interview. According to U.S.J.C.'s ad-
visor. Wes Cable, the reason was the article i wrote.

Mind you, i wasn’t the one to actually commit the of-
fense, i merely reported the facts. yet the long-term
ramifications seemed to negatively affect me more than
they did Ross himself. .

My point is that the means by which my application
was judged were unfair. According to Wes, my applica-
tion was “fine” but “that Ross article didn’t help (me) at
all.". which leads me to believe that the qualifications of
my application were ignored. and the subjective personal
feelings of the selection committee played a major role in
the selection process.

Wes and his Board should find a more professional
way to screen their applicants. it is ironic that a Judicial
Board would act in such an unjust manner.

-Michael Peteroy

Divided we fall

To the Editor:

When will the college students of the United States
become involved in the anti-nuclear movement? Men and
women from all walks of life, doctors, lawyers. scientists,
liberals and conservatives have become active; however
the college student is conspicuously silent. in Western
Europe college students are at the center of protest.
Perhaps they see more clearly that nuclear weapons are a
threat to the existence of mankind. They recognize that
their education and career have little value if the arms
race continues and Europe is the battle field in a
“limited” nuclear war. We Americans must also
recognize that even a limited exchange of warheads in
Europe'or the Mid-cast would have a serious impact upon
this country as the environment is damaged. Any major
exchange would cause the immediate death of millions of
persons and create a world environment unable to sup-
port life.

We represent the leadership: lawyers, scientists,
businessmen of tomorrow. ironically, if there is to be a
tomorrow we must become involved today. isolated we
feel alone and powerless, united we may speak out by
petitioning the leaders of the United States and the Soviet
Union to acknowledge our fear, to abandon the arms
race. and to seek a bilateral nuclear disarmament agree-
ment. We must not remain inactive and silent.

——George A. Lane-Laumann

Business, school

To the Editor:

Once again the editorial board of the ASP has proved
itself to be ignorant and nearsighted. i am referring to the
editorial of Tuesday. October 16, where the evil, power-
hungry business school attempts to take over the world.

As 21 Finance major, i personally resent your
statements and accusations. The editors attempt to por-
tray all business students as money grubbing, self-
ccntered individuals. They further portray us as totally
uninterested and unknowlcdgeabie of anything outside
the Business Administration building. The school suffers
from an "inability to teach students anything besides
business ——- like reading comprehension, basic com-
munication skills, and interpersonal relations”?! How
dare you make such an asinine. general statement. 1 sup-
pose students ofall other disciplines have an innate com-

' mand of these skills?

When are you people going to wake up and realize that
students in college learn whatever they want to learn,
regardless of their major? A student leaves college after
four years as a well-rounded individual with a variety of
skills because that is what he or she set out to do. A per-
son’s major has absolutely no bearing on the level or
variety of skills acquired: it depends on the individual.
For the editors to state Otherwise is sheer folly. -

l

   

i also differ with the editors' opinion that theAn~ ,
thropology department is going down the tubes because
of the inﬂux of some business students. i advance the
hypothesis thatone of the editors is an Anthropology ma-
jor and resents business students on his or her “turf.”
“Some of the students have complained..." is “some.”
one of the editors? So what if the professor has altered
the readings— they are not better or worse. just dif-
ferent. Who says Anthro majors have lost an education as
a result. and who said they will have to play catch up later
on? Let’s see some facts. not one sided opinions. Use
those “basic communication skills" you non-business
majors possess in such great quantities. You also neglect
to mention that Anthropology majors are beneﬁtting
from the addition of a new course, the Anthropology of
Work. i suppose mentioning that fact would have reduc-
ed the scverity of your hatchet job.

The entire editorial relies on stereotypes. Stereotypes
are used by the ignorant as a defense against the
unknown. As they fell back on such a device. l contend
that something is seriously lacking in the educations of
the editors. if you had used your excellent, “basic com-
munication and interpersonal skills," you would have
found a business school substantially different than the
one you portrayed. “Business majors eat, sleep, and
breathe business. and don't know much of anything out-
side of it."? A person becomes worldly because they want
to. not because they have a particular major. Business
“students need a more humanistic touch in their educa-
tion"? Did you ever look at any of the management
courses offered? “Ruthless, proﬁt-obsessive, exploitivc
barons"? You should give Karl Marx proper credit for
that statement. Although there are undoubtedly excep-
tions, if the narrow-minded editors were to look at cor-
porate cultures today, they would find a manager quite
different than the one portrayed. May i suggest a look at
Peoples Express Airlines, Hewlett-Packard, or even that
corporate leviathon. iBM.

i do agree with one statement in your editorial. Yes,
people do come to college to get degrees and jobs.
However. i disagree with your feeling that a career orien-
tation and a meaningful education are mutually exclusive
goals. l contend that an intelligent and dedicated student
can attain both goals.

You also state that learning about business shouldn't
be important, and that. “making money belongs as an
afterthought." First of all, who are you to dictate morals
to society? Secondly, do you really think that a business
majors' curriculum is geared solely to the objective of
making money? Once again, had you investigated before
pontificating, the copy of the editorial would have been
different.

it is very easy for the editors to portray business majors
in the way they have, since all they have to do is sit at their
desks and relay the stereotype that is in their head to the
paper that is in front of them. i think it is the responsibili-
ty of the ASP's editors to do some meaningful outside
research before publication. in order to avoid the
perpetuation of negative stereotypes. To do anything less
would be negligent. and a disservice to the readers.

Abortion an issue

To the Editor:

in the interest of newsworthiness and in light of the re-
cent outburst of controversy over the abortion issue, i
feel it is imperative that this issue he addressed by the
ASP.
' There are probably many students, for example. who
have not been thoroughly briefed on this issue and who,
for lack of better understanding. are perhaps quite ig-
norant 0n the subject. Abortion is an area of concern
where college students especially should be well-
acquainted with both sides of the issue.

in the past weeks, the ASP has given more than ample
coverage to a number of relevant topics (i.e., the Grouper
Law. Pornography. Sexual Harassment), in addition to
other topics. it seems ironic that as pertinent as these
topics are to college students, abortion is an issue that will
personally affect at least one out of every eight students
this year - and has not been given attention to by a stu-
dent press!

in view of the upcoming elections and the intense con-
troversy surrounding this heated arena, it would un-
doubtedly be in the best interest of all SUNYA students to
be more well-informed. i would hope that in the future
the ASP will recognize this and give the proper attention
to an issue which very much deserves it.
