hicve the necessary credit. “The per-
utations are just staggering," he
.sertcd.
After explaining the policy and cur-
culum change system. Oliver said. “We
e willing to do anything under current
niverslty guidelines we can.” When the
cor was open for questions. one student
kcd about the awarding of one retroac-
' {ve credit for a course previously taken.
liver replied, "The university does not
, ave a policy of retroactive credits" and
id a retroactive credit would be unfair to
me students. '
He also maintained that the curriculum
’ hange was made in the students' interest,
‘- ut that in helping some students, others
ould be hurt. “Often starting at one
'int places you in the position where it’s
at fair across the board," he said.
' “it (the change) was not as accurate as it
ould have been. i don't think we as the
udent body have to pick up the pieces,"
iticized Esther Greenberg.
, Marrono added, "if there is no policy of
etroactive credit, one should be
eveloped.” Both Oliver and Tosner said
_'y at it would take far too much time for a
I cw policy to be enacted, and expressed
oubts that it could get past all the
ecessary review committees.
. One student suggested the development
- f a one credit course for 1984 just to work
ut the problems. Tosner responded,

n Dear Andrea,

“That just wouldn’t fly. If I ever brought
that to the council they would laugh me
out of the room."

.Theresa Gil thenr referred to the stu-
dent's session with Mishlcr. She said that
he did not think that the students’ sugges-
tions were very radical and that perhaps

.the council would approve the change

before May. Since credits are not awarded
until May, the additional credit could not
be retroactive, Gil suggested.‘

Tosner'repe‘ated that it wouldn't be ap-
proved by the Graduate Academic Coun-
cil.-"lt (the council) is Very stubborn and it
(the retroactive credit idea) won’t ﬂy." he
predicted.

“Why don't you tell us what to do in-
stead of saying it can't be done?" asked a
frustrated Marrone.

One student expressed her anger that
Oliver and Tosner said that every sugges-
tion would be smothered by red tape. “I
didn't hear anyone say ‘I'll check that
out’," she declared.

Tosner concluded the meeting by saying,
“We really don’t know what to tell you to
do."

Even after leaving the meeting with
nothing solved, the Social Welfare Student
Committee is not giving up its ﬁght, Mar-
rone said. He commented, “We are disap-
pointed, but we have to sit back and
reassess the situation. We may be barking
up the wrong tree. We appreciate Dean
Oliver's position but we still believe
something can be done.” CI

‘van‘ Grol's politics '

1.-

In Europe. said Van Grol, people suf-
fered greatly from the world wars, and
after all the devastation the people told
their leaders, “enough is enough."

North Americans have been slower to
appreciate socialism, said Van Grol,
because they believe they are well off.

In Ronald Reagan's campaign against
Jimmy Carter, Reagan said the middle
class pays too many taxes and accepts too
much of the burden of social programs,
said Van Grol.

Upon election, instead of reducing mid-
dle class taxes, Reagan cut social programs
from the budget and gave tax cuts to the
wealthy, Van Grol said.

“There are no signs of anything trickl-
Ing down yet," said Van Grol, referring to
Reagan’s trickle down theory. The rich,
Van Grol contended, are not as willing as
Reagan thought they would be to
distribute their wealth among the needy.

Democratic Socialists see that this pro-
blem can be solved only by government in-
tervention, in particular, through taxation,
said Van Grol. In today’s tax system,

social security is collected from every
wage-earner, no matter how little the per-
son earns, he said. Social Security taxes
stop rising at an income of $37,000, he
said, allowing persons earning $100,000 a.
year to pay the same social security tax as
those earning $37,000 a year.

The Democratic Socialists’ solution to

the uneven tax burden would  not to tax
anyone earning a meager income. in par-
ticular. below $9,000, said Van Grol. '

Taxation is one of the main concentra-
tions of the Democratic Sociallsts of
America. Another is the nuclear arms race.
Van Grol calls the arms race “a proﬁt for
the U.S. and at the same time an economic
drain on the USSR." explaining that U.S.
induStries receive proﬁt from producing
more arms. "‘

On, the other hand, the USSR spends a-
large percentage of their gross national
product on arms, and cannot afford to in-
crease that percentage much more. “If the
USSR were smart." said Van Grol, "they
would freeze the arms race," noting that
the move would be good for propoganda,
as well as the Soviet economy. It would
make the U.S. look like a war-mongering
country. and the USSR appear more
peace-loving, said Van Grol.

Van Grol said his personal crusade for
socialism in the United States has just
started. “I've felt this way ever since I was
‘15," said Van Grol. 1 adding that his
socialist feelings have grown stronger over
time. He hopes to press his socialist ideas
further in either public ofﬁce or as a
lawyer. And he insists that Democratic

‘Socialists of America are realistic, not

idealistic. Their ideals can become realities
through public awareness. according to
Van Grol. adding, “the most I can do is
educate people."
