“This case is far from over."
said Lawrence Slade, president of
the Broekport Student Govern-

student suits.

Ronald Sinzheinter. the

argued that requiring students to
attend a hearing puts undue

they are students.

.Auletta denied that ROTC's
rights were being violated, saying
that, “The denial of a~permit by
Patty Salkin. SA programming
director, does not automatically
deny a group the right to solicit,
ROTC can still go to the Universi-
ty for an appeal. The resolution
was essentially a political state-
ment by the Student
Association."

Prior to the Supreme Court
‘meeting, University Vice Presi-
dent Lewis Welch said, “The fact
that SA has approved or disap-
proved something is inconclusive.
the decision is reveiwable by the
University, particularly if it deals
with such issues as fundamental
rights under the constitutuion.”

SA President Rich Schaffer
promised, “I’m going to bring
this up in University Council, I
don’t know why we even bother
with solicitation permits if we
don't have the authority. We
spend money on the forms and do
the paperwork."

As Auletta left the hearing, she
was confronted by John
Newman. a SUNYA,student who
has completed ROTC training.
who told her, “I wish you would
get the facts right. You represent
me when you go in there and you

should be better informed.”

Later Newman cited Army
