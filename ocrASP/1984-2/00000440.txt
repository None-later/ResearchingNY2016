. What recourse exists if your
v ndlord refuses to return the
'curity deposit after your tenan-
t has ended? Many students
v ave experienced the frustration
f dealing with a

diord who retains "'5
e tenant’s security
ithout cause. For- the
nateiy, New York
tate law provides Law
me protection for
nants regarding return of securi-

deposits.
Security deposits are sums of
oney, usually equal to one
.onth's rent, paid to the landlord
' the beginning of the tenancy.
lutside of New York City, and
e counties of Nassau, Rockland
rid Westchester. where the
eposits cannot be more than one
1onth's rent, no limitation on
lmount exists. The purpose of the

eposit is to protect the landlord

bligations under the lease.

tion to maintain the apartment in
the same condition as when they
took posession.

Legally, the security deposit
continues to be the tenant's
money during the tenancy. The
landlord is holding the money in
trust for the tenant until the end
of the tenancy. The deposit must
be kept separately by the
landlord; it is not to be mingled
with the landlord's money. if the
security deposit is combined with
the landlord’s money, the
landlord may lose the right to
claim any part of the security at
the end of the tenancy.

if there are six or more apart-
ments in the building, the
landlord must place the money in
an interest bearing bank account.
At the end of the tenancy, the te-
nant is entitled to the interest
earned minus one percent, which
the landlord is entitled to keep as
an administrative expense.

in buildings with fewer than six
apartments, the law does not re—
quire that security deposits be
placed in bank accounts.
However, if, in fact, the money is
placed in the bank then the tenant
is entitled to the interest as
described above. in any event, the
tenant is entitled to know the
name and address of the bank
where the money is being held.

Security deposits are used
primarily to pay for repair of any
damage to the apartment caused
by the tenants, although the
deposit may also be held by the
landlord for unpaid rent. Under
most leases, each tenant can be
held liable by the landlord for un-

paid rent or damage caused by
any of the tenants.

it is not proper for the deposit
to be used for repairs required
due to the ordinary wear and tear
in an apartment. The landlord is
responsible for all cleaning and
repairs which are normal or
reasonable in between tenancies.

in some cases it is difficult to
determine whether the repairs
were required due to ordinary
wear and tear or whether the
damage was sufficiently out of
the ordinary to permit use of the
security deposit. if a dispute
about the use of the security
deposit exists, the tenants can sue
the landlord in Small Claims
Court for return of the deposit.

The tenants should be prepared
to prove the following points in
court: the deposit was paid; the
tenancy is over; no rent is owed to
the landlord; no damage was
caused to the apartment above or-
dinary wear and tear; and that the
deposit was not returned.

Even if the landlord proves that
the tenants caused some damage,
they are only entitled to retain the
amount required to repair the
damage. in other words, an entire
deposit of $200 cannot be
withheld by the landlord because
the tenants broke a window which
cost $50 to repair. The landlord
will be required to prove that
repairs were actually made and
that the damage was above or-
dinary wear and tear.

The best protection for tenants
is to try to avoid a dispute .with
the landlord by taking certain

\Vote to make a difference; regrets
 afterwards won’t change anything

y Patrice Johnson
it was an early morning in

imself in his Lazy Boy recliner
nd cried endlessly. i tried to

crying about —
but my efforts

Majority

cried with such a deep intensity
unlike anything i had ever
witnessed before.

Nothing ever upset Mr. X to
this extreme, or if it did, it was
hidden by his tough exterior.
What was it that disturbed Mr. X
50 and triggered this strong .

- display of grief?

I ﬁnally brought myself to ask
him what it was that troubled him
so. “Ronald Reagan has become
president again," he said in his
low, h’usky voice. "Oh," i said,
"I guess you voted for Mon-
dale.” His head slowly began to

- ,7 rise and i could see the tears for-
ming endless pathways down his
cheeks. “i didn't vote at all."

He said this in a voice that
would normally evoke a sym-
pathetic response. instead. anger
and disappointment took me.
“Stop crying! You are partially to
blame for your own tears, Mr.
X," i said in a voice that did not
conceal my anger. Mr. X insisted,
“Didn't you hear what l said — i
said Reagan is president." l
countered his puzzled face, com-
pletely revealing my anger,
“Have you ever thought for one
moment that perhaps if you had
voted Reagan would not be presi-
dent? Cease your crying, Mr. X,
and blame yourself!" in my
anger, i left.

As i walked home I felt bad for
the way i had spoken to Mr. X.
Would he ever forgive me? I
resolved my feelings of guilt as i
told myself that he got what he
deserved and i bet he’ll vote next
time around.

At this very moment we must
stop incorporating mythologies
about our voting power into our
minds if we are to make progress.
As minorities (including women,
who are numerically the majority,
but still a minority in terms of
equality), many of us believe that
our votes do not count and if we
were to vote, it would likely have
little determination on the results.
With this def eatist attitude we can
never triumph and victory shall
remain a dream. imagine if every
single citizen who never bothered
to vote did vote '— there would be
a dramatic change and greater

. chances for underdog candidates.

As minorities, we owe it to
ourselves, to each other, and to
our future to vote now. It is we
who hold the keys to promoting
or demoting our growth. The
power to vote is our key. Once ex-
ercised, our voting power can and
will bring'about changes that will
affect our lives in the long and
short runs.

it is time that we made a sincere
commitment to press upward, for
we cannot remain at any one posi-
tion too long. Progress is ours on-

ly if we claim it. By voting we .

demonstrate our claim to pro-
gress. By voting, we choose the
governing of our lives. By voting
we prove not only to ourselves,
but to each other and to the world
that we will no longer sit back and
passively become the product of
the unforgetten.

it is time for us to stop display-
ing Mr. X’s behavior and to get
up and vote. Let us vote for our
communities and our nation, for
our born and unborn children,
and 'or ourselves.

We can no longer wait for so»
meone to water us. We must
water ourselves if we are to grow
and blossom.

Don't let our dreams forever
remain dreams — we must
capitalize on these dreams. Once
capitalized on, these dreams can '
become our reality; our lives. it is
good to dream healthy dreams,
but even better is knowing that
the dream of progress can be our
reality.

Let's vote. Let's make a dif-
