According to recent statistics,
the acceptance rate for 1984
SUNYA graduates applying to
law school. dental, optometry. or
pediatric medicine was loo per-
cent. Tcrenzini added that “the
typical graduating SUNY senior
applied to two graduate schools
and got into one of them."

When 1980 SUNYA graduates
were surveyed. two-thirds said
they were satisﬁed with theirjobs.
while 20 percent said they were
not. 60 percent of the 1980
graduates going on to graduate
school said they were planning to
continue their studies in the same
field as their undergraduate ma-
jor. or in one closely related.

Of those 1980 graduates work-
ing full-time. 67 percent said they
had‘taken a full-time job in afiqld
the same or closely related to their
undergraduate major.

Choosing a major is a difficult
task. Often, students say they
find themselves faced with a

    

choice between the practical ma-
jor and something they’re in-
terested in. ‘

“People are always asking me,
‘so what are you going to do with
Philosophy?“ And I always
answer. ‘l'm going to open a
philosophy store’." said
Philosophy major Ben Adler.

Adler, a senior who plans to
graduate in May. is not concerned
about what he is going “to do"
with his major. “I don't thing I'm
as anxious as the average student
about making money when I get
out of school. i want to live well
but my main concern is my hap-
piness," he said.

Adler said he plans to take time
off after graduation and travel in
Europe for a few months. “i
might get a job.” he added, “in
another city i haven’t been to just
to see what it would be like to live
and work somewhere else.”

He said he is thinking about go-
ing on to graduate or law school

Last spring, Rozelle had hinted
that legal action might signal the
death throes of the USFL.

“You will know when they are
on their last legs. They will bring
a lawsuit against us," Rozelle told
The Boston Globe after the NFL
meetings. “This will be how they
try- to keep the owners from jum-
ping ship. They will hold out their
suit as a way of getting their
money back if they stay around.”

Donald Trump, owner of the
USFL's New Jersey Generals,
disagreed. "l predict we’ll be vic-

has totally placed itself in a

said. “The NFL has taken control

“You will know when they are

——Pcte Rozelle

 

The USFL suit asks that NFL
contracts with the three major
television networks be voided and
that the NFL's “monopoly” on
player contracts and stadiums be
broken.

ABC spokesman lrv Brodsky

'were named as defendants in the

$440 million suit. Under antitrust
law, the award would be tripled in
the event of a favorable ruling.
The USFL was formed in 1982
as what its founders said was a

.summer alternative to the NFL.

/

The USFL came into being with
two-year television contracts

estimated at from $18 million to:

$22 million.

Last season, the league expand-
ed from 12. to 18 teams and
several of the franchises were
sold. leaving only six of the
original owners. it also spent
millions to sign college stars like
Steve Young. Herschel Walker
and Mike Rozier and finished last
season with losses estimated at
$63 million.

The suit stated that the USFL.
since its first season in 1983. has
been forced to play a spring
schedule “given the monopoly of

the NFL member clubs" in the

fall season.
