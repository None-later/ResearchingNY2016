leads theteam with seven interceptions in—

touchdown. He also has done a'credible
job returning punts and kicks.

played so 'well is because of our whole at-

was more indiyiduality. I had a .lot of in-
terceptions but that'couldn't have come
without the pass rush or the help from Ray
(Priore) or Jimmy (Collins).

Though the Dane’s secondary considers
themselves a unit, there will be a lot of eyes
focused on Anderson's performance dur-
ing tomorrow’s game at Norwich. The 5-I

named Beau Almobodar, who averages 10
catches per game:

Lawrence University, Almobodar caught a‘

79-yard pass in the opening minute of the

and implement a man-to-man defense.
Anderson's man is Almobodar.

Earl is another punishing runner the
Danes’ will have to look out for.

The Cadet defense is not as valuable as
its offense, but Ford still respects Nor-

their whole team is in great physical

Freshman quarterbaék Jeff Russell will
be making his ﬁfth start and is coming off

“That game was a big conﬁdence

Men’s cross country

Ever since then appearance at the
NCAA Division lll Championships last
fall, the Albany State men’s cross coun-
try squad has been “a team to watch".
The Danes finished 18th in the nation
last year and lost no seniors to gradua-
tion. The team ran very well during the
dual meet season, compiling a 9-3
record and losing only the season
opener against Division I powers Army
and Syracuse,’ and Division ll East
Stroudsburg. After romping over most
of their Division III competition in nine
straight wins since the opener, the ques-
tion is now “How far will they go?"

Senior Ed McGill put it this way,

- “We have so much potential, we don't

know what to do with it. This team
could be tops if the right things
happen.” _

Now the NCAA agrees. Recently. a
poll of coaches in Division III listed the
top l0 teams in the nation ranking only
one New York region team, St.
Lawrence, among the ten. However
three other New York teams, the
University of Rochester, the Rochester
institute of Technology, and Albany
State, were among the six teams receiv-
ing Honorable Mention status.

Head Coach Bob 'Munsey com-
mented, “Of course we’re honored to
be recognized as national class by the
NCAA, that’s great, but what’s it
worth? We’re not going to let it swell
our heads because in cross country it all
comes down to about a half hour of
running and beforehand you can talk
all-you want."

Men boogie-59

Defeated in double overtime, 53

By Dean Chang
Assocla r5 smn rs canon

You couldn’t ask for a better perfor-
mance from Albany State's men's soccer
team. The Danes' offense was productive,
their defense was‘ solid. and their goalten-
ding was spectacular at times. The only
thing Albany didn't get was a win, but ex-
tending Oneonta State to two overtimcs
before losing, 5-3, was an accomplishment
in itself.

Ranked fourth in the state in Division I,
Oneonta is in a strong position to gain a
playoff berth. A loss to Albany would
have been disastrous to their post-season
chances, and the Red Dragons knew it. To
lose to a sub-par team (Albany’s record
stands at 3-7-2) would be unforgitablc at
this stage of the season. But the team that
Oneonta faced on Wednesday was not a
sub-par team.

One of Oneonta’s coaches said that
“Albany played the best ofany team we’ve
seen. it was one of the best games that
we‘ve seen all year.“ Considering
Onconta's tough schedule which includes
nationally ranked teams, the compliment
becomes more significant.

“We are. not a 3-7 team," said Albany
Head Coach Bill Schieffelin. “From what
I’ve seen at times, especially yesterday, we
are a much better team. Just ask Oneonta.
They'll tell you that we are the best team
they’ve faced all year."

But the Danes are 3-7', in spite of their
talent and latest efforts. Against quality
opponents, Albany rises to their level and
plays them closely. Against inferior op-
ponents, the Danes can‘t seem to maintain
their high standard of play.

For the women's soccer team, this
season has been one in which they learn-
:d each other‘s moves and learned to
complement each other on the field. Un-
fortunately, this is a time-consuming
process as the Danes learned on Tues—
day, losing to Hartwick by a score of

The loss lowered the team's record to
2 - 9 but Assistant Coach Lisa France
commented, “The record doesn't mean
that much to us. What is important is
that we are learning how to play
together. Also the attitude of our
players is super. They haven't written
the season off and they‘re playing hard
in every game."

The Danes did suffer the loss of
goalkeeper Maureen Keller for the re-
mainder of the season. She was hurt in
the Danes' game against Springfield and
x-rays showed she suffered a broken
finger.

“I dove for a hard shot and the finger

The women's soccer team was beaten 3-0 by Hertwlek on Tuesday. Their record

"i don’t know what it is," said Jerry
lsaacs. “We deﬁnitely have the skill, but
something is not clicking. I guess we have
different attitudes for different games. It's
one thing to say we'll do well, but we've
got to go out and do it."

Losing to one good team after another
despite playing well has to be frustrating
for Albany. The team is obviously capable
of better things. despite their record.

“it's unfortunate when you play a great
game against a top-quality team that we
have to |ose,"said Schieffelin, “because
we definitely frustrated the hell out of
them."

Albany had two excellent opportunities
to score during the last five minutes of
play. Mike Jasmin had a breakaway on the
tight side. Onconta's goalkeeper came out
to challenge him as Jasmin chipped the
ball over the goalkeeper’s head and wide
of the net.

lsaacs was a victim of the “bad breaks,"
as his shot with only minutes remaining hit
teammate Scott Cohen.

“That shot summed up our frustrations
for the year," said Schieffelin. “Those are
the breaks sometimes. One little quirk of
fate can determine the outcome of the
game."

The first overtime period saw the re-
emergence of goaltender Howard Tygar.
Tygar started the season with two
shutouts, but his play has been unsteady at
times. With two-time All-SUNYAC goalie
Tom Merritt out for the year, Tygar’s ﬁne
play was a welcome sight. -

Tygar has been criticized by Scheffelin
for thinking too much instead of letting his
reflexes do the job. Against Oneonta,

just snapped,” explained Keller.

Her replacement, Kathy DiBennedet-
to, has done an excellent job at
goalkeeper according to France. Keller
explained, “This is her first year in goal
and i think she has adjusted very well to
the position.”

The Hartwick game was a reflection
of the Danes’ .' ‘Ison. They started slow-
ly, .tnd Hartwick scored three times
before the Danes could recover.

“in the second half,“ noted Coach
France, “We played our best half oi‘thc
season. On defense, we frustrated them,
and didn't allow a goal, while on of-
fense we had opportunities but were
beset by bad luck. Three of our shots hit
the crossbar and bounced out. We got
our chances but itlck wasn't on our

 

Looking to the remainder of the
schedule, the Danes play Plattsburgh to-
day and Castlcton here on Monday.
Coach France said, “Our attitude and
spirit is up, the girls are getting better
with each game."

Tygar accomplished his task.

“i didn't think about the mistakes that I
could have made," said Tygar. “i didn't
feel shaky at all; I psyched myself and just
played the way i know I can."

With several members of the team play-
ing with injuries, the length of the game
chopped away at the Danes’ efficiency.
The second overtime period saw a tired
Albany team unable to execute an offsides
trap play, which led to Oneonta’s fourth
goal. '

“I told the players between the two
overtime periods that i didn't want the
team to make mistakes," said Scheffelin.
“We should have been more conservative
on defense."

Albany got their first goal when lsaacs
took the ball down the left side and crossed
it to Jasmin, who put the ball in at the far
post to tie the score at one.

After Oneonta regained the lead, Cohen
intercepted a clearing shot by an Oneonta
defenscman and shot through players that
screened the Red Dragon goalkeeper to
make the halftime score 2-2.

Oneonta wasn't able to put the Danes

g away, as Albany answered each Oneonta

goal with one of their own. They tied the
score at three as Warren Manners took a
pass from Carl loos and drew the
goalkeeper out of the net. As the
goalkeeper closed in on Manners, the Dane
chipped the ball over the goaltender and
into the net.

Albany tried to play a semi-defensive
game with nine men ready to fall back on'
defense. Scheffelin praised lsaacs and
Tihan Presbic on the offensive side, as
they set up goals just by being offensive
targets.

“The way i look at it, we played even
with an excellent Division l team," said
Scheffelin. “It's been the little twists of
fate that‘s been affecting us all year."

The team's objective now is to have a
sustained performance for an entire game.
The Dames play Vassar on Saturday, the
lOth-ranked team in New York in Division .
lll. Schieffelin thinks that Vassar is a team
Albany can beat.

“Vassar's caliber of opponents is not
the same as ours," said Scheffelin. "They
won’t play anyone with the players that
Union. Binhamton, or Oneonta has. We
can win." [3

Women spikers split pair '

By Doug Israel
STAFF WRITER

The women's volleyball team split their
matches on Tuesday night at the Albany
Gymnasium, beating Cortland and then
losing to Colgate.

Against Cortland, the spikers lost the
first game by the score of 9-15, but storm-
ed back to take the next two, 15-6, 15-2.

The emotional high of their comeback
victory was not enough to carry them past
Colgate, who won l4-l6, l0-lS. The team
should be commended, however, because
they were forced to play without one of
their most valuable players, center and co-
captain Terry Neaton, who twisted her
ankle in practice the previous day.

Stepping in her place was Donna
Vipulis, who came off the bench and did a
great job. The whole team was forced to

bear down because of Neaton's absence.
Jean Colaio, who normally sets one posi-
tion, set two and the team's main hitter.
Patty Munhall, set an incredible four posi-
tions. Freshman Chris Hoffer led the team
in blocks and sophomore Liz Praetorius
played well off the bench. Also deserving
mention is Karen Truss who played a great
game and co-captain Rhonda Rogerstwho
had to take Neaton's place in the area of
team leadership.

Coach Dwyer, despite the defeat to Col-
gate, feels the team is in an upward swing
as they enter the ﬁnal leg of the season
before the NCAA playoffs begin.

Next Tuesday the Danes play a tourna-
ment against Russell Sage, Union and
Oswego in the final home matchup of the
season. Game time is 6:00. The team’s
season record is now l7 wins and 6 losses.
