Regents Calls for aid

, I Syracuse, NY
(AP) Expanded student aid programs and
more 'money for graduate education are
needed at colleges and universities in New
York state in the next four years. accor-
ding to the state Board of Regents.
The board proposed a wide variety of
programs Monday in its four-year plan for

higher education, which will be submitted ‘

to Gov. Mario Cuomo.

No cost estimate was made in the re-
quest for new programs.

Among projects regents said they would
like to see were: .

-A program to give students ﬁnancial
aid in exchange for public service work.

-Special'efforts to recruit women and
minorities for programs in the sciences.

(AP) Former State Sen. Joseph Pisani
has been charged with taking part in a
scheme in which a bogus child-abuse agen-
cy allegedly was established as a way of cir-
cumventing state gun laws.
In a petition ﬁled in the Appellate Divi-
sion of state Supreme Court in Brooklyn,

*the Westchester Society for the Prevention

of Cruelty to Children claimed that the
other group never investigated a child-
abuse case.

Albany, NY
(AP) A state survey estimates that 83 per-
cent of 7th-12th grade students in the state
have used alcohol and that l3 percent have

The survey, released Monday, found
that 40 percent of l2-year-olds drink occa~
sionally and that 2 percent are heavy
drinkers--drinking at least once a week and
consuming 5-12 drinks on each occasion.

In addition. 10 percent of the students
surveyed said they had driven a car after

NAT opposes plan

~ New York
(AP) The secretary-general of NATO said
Monday he opposed the alliance promising
not to use nuclear weapons ﬁrst because
the promise would make conventional war
more likely.

“A policy of no ﬁrst use of nuclear
weapons seems attractive. no doubt, from
the moral point of view," said Lord Carr-
ington of Britain, who took over as
secretary-general of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization in June.

"And it also has the merit of protecting
us against nuclear blackmail by preserving
an effective deterrent in that respect. The
disadvantage, which to my mind Is an
overwhelming one, is that it weakens the
equally important deterrant against con-
ventional war."

SUNYA gets record $20Mgfori‘re

By Beth Fi‘nneran .

A record 520.264.653 in grants
and external funding for research
was given to SUNYA last year.
accrding to coordinator of Spon-
sbred Programs. Frank DiSanto.

Several departments each at-
tracted over one million dollars in
outside funding, including the
biology, chemistry, and
psychology departments.

The Atmospheric Sciences
Research Center, the Center for
Women in Government, and the
Rockefeller College of Public Af-
fairs and Policy also garnered
over one million dollars. DiSanto

said this represented substantial
increases from I983.

Much of the funding was sup-
plied by state agencies. industry,
and private foundations. SUNYA
was the third highest recipient of
outside funding in the SUNY
system, behind only Stony Brook
and Buffalo, DiSanto said.

The rise in funding, a 21 per-
cent increase over 1983, is im-
pressive, he said, because most
grants are reserved for health and
engineering programs, which are
not available at SUNYA.

DiSanto also said that the in-
crease demonstrates the “conti-
nuing strength” of SUNYA’S

departments faced stiffer com-
petition for external dollars due
to decreases in federal aid.

ln l973. DiSanto said. the cam-
pus received eight to ten million
dollars in research funding. The
fact that this has doubled in ten
years is partly the result of “the
university’s efforts to bring to the
campus faculty members that are
not only excellent teachers but
who have excellent research
capabilities," DiSanto said.

“It’s not just one or two new
large grants," DiSanto said. “but
continued research by quality
faculty members from many
disciplines that has sustained this
growth in external funding."

The Michael J. Hindclang
Criminal Justice Research Center
which is affiliated with the
University this year. acquired for
the first time, $471,000 in grants.

State agencies supplied 24 per-
cent of the funds. "A part of the
increase is (due to) the public
policy mission of this campus,"
DiSanto said. citing a $3.3 million
contract between Rockefeller Col-
lege and the Governor's Office of
Employcchelations for advanced
training of professional state
employees.

Federal sources provided 66
percent of the money industrial

university’s career planning and placement

draws anywhere from six to thirty SUNYA
students to its recruiting session each

James Fitzgerald, the CIA's recruiting
representative to SUNYA said. “The past

year.”

The CIA, Fitzgerald said. is interested in
students with degrees “ranging from the

USSA leads

{By Ilene Welnsteln
STAFF WRITER

SUNYA students will soon be able to
lobby for a federal bill that would prohibit
private schools receiving federal student
aid from discriminating against minorities.

A lobbying campaign supporting the bill
is being planned by the SUNYA Chapter
of United States Student Association.

The bill, titled the I984 Civil Rights Bill,
seeks to close a loophole in the I964 Civil
Rights Act which allows private schools
receiving federal student aid funds to
discriminate against minorities in all areas
except financial aid.

The loophole was revealed by a US.
Supreme Court case, Grove City College v.
Bell. which has been in litigation since
1972 and was ruled on this year.

As a result of the ruling. explained new-
ly elected USSA delegate Eric Bowman.
the court has dropped all the pending cases
concerning discrimination by private
institutes.

The l984 Civil Rights bill, passed earlier
this year by the House of Representatives
352 to 32, was introduced to make it illegal

work for the CIA.”

Jobs within the CIA cover a wide range
of career possibilities. he said. There are
openings for computer systems analysts,,as
well as. intelligence analysts._ln addition.
opportunities are available for people 'to'
do research and writing for the agency. Of
course, Fitzgerald said, there is also a need
for overseas intelligence ofﬁcers, a job any
spy enthusiast has probably fantasized
about

“The application process on the
SUNYA campus begins with a general in-
terest meeting,” said Christine McKnight
from the University News Service. “The
placement ofﬁce has lists of the various
companies that come in...The CIA is one
of them." she explained. This year’s in-
terest meeting will be on November 1. Ac-
cording to McKnight the interest meeting
is open to all students. After the meeting
students can make appointments for
interviews.

To get a job with the CIA, Fitzgerald ex-
plained. students ﬁll out application
forms, go through interviews, and take a
general aptitude test. Studentsgmusl. also,
take a security_test as part of the applica-m

'tibn process. he added. t

The starting salary for a CIA profes-
sional is “7,138. according to a recent
Times Union article.

The CIA once faced a great deal of op-
position from students at many campuses.‘
the article said. However, Stewart said.
SUNYA was not one of those campuses.
“I was here during that time but the CIA
didn‘t have any trouble; other companies
such as Bell did, but not the ClA,”she
recalled.

“The CIA does not have the stigma as
being involved in things that students are
all stirred up over today or not to the
degree they did in the late '60's...l suspect
that they do have the stigma to some
degree for involvement in Central
America. if nothing else, but it is not

.
something that students are that concerned,
about," said RPI American history pro-
fessorJack Batter,;.in the Times Union
 7.4. .- .-i to L,. . ‘3.  ‘i .‘ -‘V,'-..7

Apparently there are still some negative
attitudes ‘towa'rd the CIA. At Union Col-
lege. for example. the CIA draws only
about a dozen students compared to the 60
to 80 who sign up for the popular
recruiters. such as Kodak, New York
Telephone. Digital and IBM, the Times
Union article said.

“The SUNYA campus treats the CIA
just as we would treat corporate recruiting
ofﬁcers or recruiting ofﬁcers from any
other government agency," said
McKnight.

During the Vietnam War era, four thou-
sand students turned out to protest the
CIA interviews at the University of
Wisconsin at Madison. But according to
CIA ofﬁcials quoted in the Times Union
article, the protests never reduced the
number of applicants. f3

'campus efforts for ’84 civil rights bill

 

 

USSA delegate Erlc Bowman

He says the bill is “necessary.”

for private colleges to discriminate in any
way against minorities if the school receiv’
ed federal financial aid.

Bowman said the bill was necessary
because of the recent Supreme Court
decision.

According to Bowman, the primary op-
ponents to the bill were Senate Majority

Leader Howard Baker (R-TN). and
Senator Orrin Hatch. (R-UT).

Baker “washed his hands" of the bill
and prevented it from reaching the Senate
floor until the end of the last session.
Bowman charged.

When it did reach the floor. the bill was
tagged on to an emergency appropriations
resolution that the govarument needed to
continue operating. The civil rights bill
was withdrawn, after much controversy, In
order ensure passage of the appropriations
resolution. It was then tabled. .

USSA chapters across the country have
been carrying out letter writing campaigns
against Baker since early September, in an
effort to get him to bring the bill to a vote,
Bowman said.

Ross Abelow, also a newly elected
USSA delegate. explained that “USSA has
paid lobbyists in Washington, D.C. who
are in touch with all the Senators."
Abelow said the letter writing campaign
would be continued until Congress meets
again in January.

Efforts to raise campus awareness will

also be made. Bowmansaid. explainins.

that “most students are unaware of the
Civil Rights Act and what it entails."

“If a few key Senators change her
minds. the bill will be passed." \Ltltl
Dwayne Sampson, a SUNYA delegate to
the National Third World Coalition.

The next'U.S. president may also effect
the bill's future. Sampson said, because
there is a great deal of interaction between
the White House and Capital Hall.

“President Reagan has shown he is
against the bill. He hasn't called any
Senators seeking their support for the
bill," Sampson maintained.

Bowman agreed. saying that where
Presidents Carter and Ford lobbied for
changes in the Civil Rights Act to protect
against a decision like Grove City College.
Reagan has lobbied in support of the
Grove City College limitations.

“They (Hatch and Baker) didn’t want it
voted on before the (presidential) elec-
tion,” said Bowman, adding that “they
didn’t want it to seem that the Republicans

, had opposed it." '
