The new program is outlined in a docu-
ment recently published by the National
Institute ovaorrections called Directions
for Community Corrections in the 1990's
based on O’Leary and Clear's l983 book
Controlling the Offender in the
Community. .

Clear. a former student of ()‘I.eary‘s at
Albany’s School of Criminal Justice. said
that current correctional methods are
“designed to exact a symbolic punishment
rather than prevent a crime." which. the
article'explains. is\"a vision of offender

rehabilitation that today is seriously
flawed." '
The new program is currently being in-

itiated at correctional systems in Col-
orado. Vermont, and Oregon. A fourth
program is already under-way itt Delaware
under the guidance of Tom Quinn.
another SUNYA graduate. The projects
are being supported by toSJOi).0()O grant
from the National institute of Corrections.

O‘Leary and' Clear's plan proposes
establislting different levels of supervision
for parolccs depending on tile risk they
pose of committing new crimes.

Those most likely to cottttrtii new crimes
would be most closely supervised. while

context.

The tnost essential factor. O‘Leary and

. Clear say. is that criminal justice agencies
take an “organic approach to change." By
this they mean that correctional systems
should form task forces to conduct com-
prehensive research and to ntonitor
systems. to supplement the training of
their officers.

it's not an easy job. Clear admitted. btrt
the limited risk control model is realistic
because it “begins by admitting the limits
ot' our knowledge of how to work with this
tnassive public problem." he said.

criminal sentencing guidelines. has just

Howard Nolan

By James O'Sulllvan
ASSOCIATE ~cws Etztmu

Demonstrating a split record on
common student concerns. State
Senator Howard Nolan. currently
running for re-election in Albany
County. said he voted for abilllast
year to kill SUNY tuition hikes,
but he will actively work towards
a 21-year-old drinking age.

In an interview last Thursday in
WCDB-9l FM’s studio. Nolan
explained why he co-sponsored a
Senate bill to raise the legal drink-
ing age from 19 to 2|.

Calling the statistics “stagger-
ing.” he said that if the problem
of drunk drivers is to be solved.
young people must lose the right
to drink. But Nolan also said he
sympathized with those who
would be affected adverser if the
drinking age went up. “Unfor—
tunately a lot of people have to
pay for the sins of a few." he
said.

Nolan said the issue was often
raised at home by his seven

children, aged 16 to 23. He said

he agreed with their arguments
that not all l9 and 20 year olds
abuse alcohol. but. he said. “Un-
fortunately in our .society you
have to make laws for the better
of everybody and I know any law
you pass there are some groups
within society that maybe are un-
justly affected by it."

In addition to sponsoring
pro-21 legislation. Nolan said that
he would wprk to repeal the man-
datory seat belt law which New
York State Governor Cuomo
signed this summer. He also said
he expects that the 21 drinking

well. He called education the
most important government
function. r

“We have to do as much as
possible to increase student
assistance." he said. but admited
he did not know where the extra
funding could be found. “The
ideal way is to fund the increased
costs through revenue attained in
the general budget. in other words
the tax revenues that we receive as
a result of the myriad of taxes we
have in this state." Nolan
explained.

The senator rejected any fur-
ther taxes on industry to help sup-

 

port SUNY. "I have a problem
with tues as for as business is
concerned. not because of
business (pressures) but because
we have to compete with 49 other
states."He said he believes New
York State's business taxes are
too high to attract new industry.
"We've fallen behind a lot of
other states on that basis." he
added.

The fairest tax possible. Nolan
said. is the federal personal in-
come tax because people can't
escape it by moving from state to
state.

Nolan said he supports a state

 

age will pass this year. r ,
with the possibility the state will
be denied federal highway funds
if the drinking age stays at I9.

Senate who graduated from
Albany Law School in 1957. said
he voted in favor of a bill that

increases last year. and that he

STAFF WRITER

The Republican state senatorial
candidate for Albany County.
Joseph C. Frangclla. said in an in-
terview Monday that he opposes
SUNY tuition increases. but fail-
ed to reveal what measures he
supports to avert such increases.

who is trying to unseat the 10 year
Democratic incumbent. Howard
C. Nolan, cited the efforts of
Republican senators to prevent
cuts in TAP. but did not state his
own position on changes in TAP
beneﬁts.

He'said he favored. but did not
give specifics about. state aid for
higher education. “I'm for easing
the burden on students and
students' parents so they can have
a college education." he said. He
also said he can “relate” to finan-
cial problems students and their
parents face because he sent his
children to college.

Frangella was emphatic in his

support for maintaining the 19
year old drinking age. l‘If you
raise the drinking age. you’re go-
ing to drive drinking
underground," he claimed. He
said he wouldn’t support a law
“that my own kids wouldn't
obey.”

He said he would not favor a
legislative mandate to move
SUNY'S sports programs to Divi-
‘sion I or to impose an administra-
tion rather than student controll-
ed athletic fee. Last month the
SUNY Board of Trustees rejected
both proposals. Members of the

Student Association of the Statem

University (SASU) had opposed
the proposals.

“I would respect the wishes of
the SUNY Board and the
students.“ said Frangella. “Why
should the Legislature or anybody
else force them to do something
they don"t feel is in their best in-
terest)” he asked.

He said he supports the Equal

The death penalty should be us-
ed only in "limited instances." he
said. citing the murder of a prison
guard or a policeman. as possible
examples.

A person who is convicted of
murdering two or more people or
who has committed murder while
on parole for a previous murder
conviction should also face the
death penalty. he added.

Frangelia did not take a firm
stand on having SUNY Central
divest its holdings in corporations
with investments in South Africa.
Student leaders have repeatedly
called for this measure because of
alleged apartheid in South Africa.

“The people in charge would
have to see what is most beneﬁcial
lu SUNY." the 56 year old can-
didate said. If SUNY ofﬁcials
think divestiture is not beneﬁcial,

they should not be forced to
divest. he maintained.

Frangella did say he doesn’t
“approve of government prac-
tices in South Africa.“

The problems facing the

Long Island are “pretty much a

primarily interested in the 42nd

Help available for students facing writer’s block

By Andrea Corson

Victims of writers block. or students panicking about
term papers can find the help they need in SUNYA‘s

Writing Center.

Rather than proofreading and correcting grammar. the
Writing Center. located in Humanities 140. tries to help
students by focusing on what they do when they write.

“Four things that we focus on when a student comes in
with a paper." said staff member Meg Seckendorf. “is
the message. or what the student is trying to say; the pur-
pose, or why are they writing this;

the student writing to; and their

student trying to be in the piece and ltow are they presen-

ting themselves.“

According to Seckendorf “You learn a lot rttore this
way rather than by handing in a product and having so-
meone correct it." Seckendorf said she has been helping
students with their writing for 3 years.

Not only does the Writing Center help people with
papers or essays, but also with applications to law school.

times. at each stage of a paper. The Center also works
with a lot of graduate students. Seckendorf said.

“We want to make better writers. not better writing,"
said Seckendorf. She said site would rather do this than

teach a course.

 

Assistant Director Gerry DiCarlo said. “It’s fun. tutors
just want to have fun. It’s really interesting because we
deal with so ‘many different people and they have dif-
ferent writing styles." Center Director Steve North said
he brings in his own papers to talk about with other

"We are a good humored bunch." reported DiCarlo.

The Writing Center itself has no funding. but the staff
is paid by the English department, according to North.
who said that the department has always supported the
Writing Center.

All those who advise in the Cettter work ll hours a
week and "make the equivalent of what a part-time per-
sort makes for teaching one course," according to
Seckendorf.

Due to the tightness of the University budget the
English department has not been able to provide corn-
