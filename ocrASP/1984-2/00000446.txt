RiSing elderly crime 'perpIGXing court~s,=prisonsf

' By Jackie Clark

, “Ten years ago we weren't
reading (in the media) about 63
year-old women rolling drunks;
we weren’t reading about 78 year-
old doctors selling drugs; (and)
we weren’t reading about 83 year-
old men murdering their wives."
said one of three SUNYA resear-
chers who have documented a
growing trend in criminal ac-
tivities: Grandma the hood and
Grandpa the bruiser.

It's all part of the growing wave
of crimes committed by the elder-
ly. or the over 55 years old
population. according to SUNYA
Professor Donald Newman.

Mr. Newman. who recently co-
authored Elderly Crima with
SUNYA Professor Evelyn
Newman and Mindy Gerwitz.
said the book was written to call
attention to the unusual problem
of crimes committed by older
people, and to point out the need
for more research on the subject.

They point to two cases which
illustrate this problem: A
Baltimore woman, 63. was charg-
ed with robbery. kidnapping and
assault with intent to murder in
January. I983. Police said she
lured"elderlyand defenseless men
to her car, drugged them with
spiked drinks. robbed and later
dumped them in ditches."

An Albany physician, 78, was
fined $22,000 and barred from
writing prescriptions for controll-

"because they are going'to starve.
The things they steal. by the large.
are luxuries: shaving lotion. per-

. . .elderly crime is “a phenomenon
that we as a society ought to
understand. ”

—Evelyn Newman

Police "didn't know what to
do with (the case).',’ Mrs.
Newman said. “so they did
nothing." '

“ As far as we know." she said.

. “he is still living where he was liv-

ing. Now suppose a 27 yearold
had murdered his wife. They
wouldn't say ‘we don’t know
what to do'with that.”

Mrs. Newman cited a second
case. that of an elderly woman
who was arrested for growing
marijuana. She was let I'ree. said
Mrs. Newman. while her grand-
son. who was growing the drug
with her. was sent to prison.

According to Mr. Newman. the

According to Elderly
Criminals the number of total air-
rests of elderly people has
undergone a 5.7 percent increase
between the years 1964 and I979.

However. the book said, this
percentage represents an increase
of I48 percent in major felony ar-
rests within the elderly group in
the past decade.

According to Mr. Newman,
shoplifting constitutes a large part
of the crimes committed by the
elderly. but. he said, the elderly
are not stealing necessities.

Mr. Newman said that the
elderly are not shoplifting

shoplifters polled owned their
own residence. 52 percent had at
least a high school education and
40 percent had an average income
of oyer $10,000 per year.
According to Mr. Newman. the
aged are involved in all types of
crime. including shoplifting.
homicide and sex crimes. He add-

ed that the major problem is.

elderly offenders. Mrs. Newman
cited the case of an 83 year old
man who axed his wife of 50 years
to death when she bought home

of bagels.

designed for the elderly. so there
are few programs in place to deal

.with the problem. For example.

he said. a short sentence of only a
few years may become a life
sentence for an elderly person.

Treatment and housing of
elderly criminals are problems
which Mr. Newman noted. ad-
ding that New York State has a
special voluntary unit for dealing
with elderly criminals. However.
he said. there are few existing pro-
grams that deal with elderly
criminals. According to Mr.
Newman. wardens like to in-
tegrate aged criminals with
younger ones because of a calm-
ing influence the elderly inmates

may exert on the younger
inmates.
However. he said. the elderly

' are often afraid of the younger

criminals.

‘ Mr. Newman sald.special pro-
gramming for elderly criminals
may be‘a solution to some pro-
blems. One suggestion he noted
involved an elderly justice system.
similar to the juvenile justice
system. where the court could
"act in the best interests" of the
accused. ‘

However. he pointed out that
the elderly criminals themselves
do not want a separate system.

Many elderly do not want to be
considered as teenagers are. he
said.

According to Mrs. Newman.
most elderly people remain law-
abiding citizens. “We don't want
to make the claim." she
said."that all elderly are going to
a no-good end."

Mr. Newman said that there is

an increase in the elderly popula-‘

tion which will partly explain a
probable increase in elderly crime
in the future.

According to Mrs. Newman.
the whole criminal justice system
will have to begin to consider
elderly criminals. She said that.
regardless of the statistics. elderly
crime is “a phenomenon that we
as' a society ought to unders-
tand.” [I]
