GSEU seeks fiscal beneﬁts
but not a scholasticfunction -

By John Crawford

“The reasons for a Graduate Student
Employees Union (GSEU) for Graduate
Assistants, Teaching Assistants and
Research Assistants sound ﬁne, but I don ’t
want it to come between me and my
professor. ' ‘

The reasons and rhetoric for unions
should be translated into 

e

everyday situations in

order to access their

beneﬁts. Will the osau Graduate
members suffer because

the Union will interfere Advocate
in the student/mentor

relationship? No. The GSEU will not play
a scholastic role in the member's academic
degree program. In fact, the GSEU‘s goal
is to make the scholar/mentor relationship
more comfortable.

The GSEU wants to raise the economic
standing of all GA/TA/RAs to the point
where their livelihood and family financial
obligations do not interfere with their
academic success. Graduate employees
should have a reasonable salary to support
their tenure at SUNYA and not have to
secretly moonlight in order to meet their
obligations.

We are at SUNYA to engage in our
:t‘holarrlic interests, and to perform our
educational w,- ' 't. for SUN ‘r' \Vri are not

Hi the tr"il U is to l'l't't‘ up our

‘ financial situation and not have to scurry

around in secret to find moonlighting jobs
that fit into our schedules. instead of com-
ing betwen graduates and professors, the
union can acquire come collegial comfort
for the scholar/mentor relationship at
SUNYA.

Furthermore, some of the primary goals
of the GSEU are also the goals of depart-
ment Chairpersons. Like the OSEU, they
want to keep all current GA/TA/RA lines.
they would like to give us higher salaries.
they want us to shine as young academics
and excel in our educational services at
SUNYA. If these goals were fulﬁlled, then
SUNYA departments could continue to at-

tract the best students with a recruiting
package that-could compete with its na-
tional peer institutions.

Currently Chairpersons are frustrated
over their inability to acquire these
beneﬁts for graduate employees. Their
demands are smothered under layers of
bureaucracy within schools. then with
SUNYA, then in SUNY/Central and then
the state itself. The GSEU. on the other
hand, knows its 4,500 members will have a
better chance at these goals when we
directly bargain with SUNY/Central and
the Ofﬁce of Employee Relations.

What if an individual professor dislikes
unions? If a professor would propose
obstacles to any of us trying to better our
standard of living through our own
efforts-~tlten we really need a union. if a
citizen in their 205 and 305 is inhibited
from making decisions effecting their
lives, then the GSEU will be a liberating
experience for that individual. Additional-
ly the union can support any informal ef-
forts to correct non-public grievances. Or.
it can take the lead in formal grievance
procedures to correct institutional in-
justices and bureaucratic mishaps.

Remember too, that all our mentors and
educational supervisors receive lrcncfils
from their own union. They are orltani/cd
tor their own economic interests within
:iUNY. “/’\.‘.‘sir;tant\" on the. other hand.
are the last unorganitcd prut'wsionals on
the filiN‘x' campuses. Marry professors
believe it is long overdue for “assistants”
to organire and assert their own influence
on SUNY policies. Unquestiuntrhly, they
see :I lilzt‘mitttlcd hut unique ally in campus
rttl‘aits.

Far from undermining the scholar men-
tor relationship, the ('lSlTU can add to the
collegial atmosphere of the campus and.
probably ally our own union with that of
our mentors and educational supervisors.
As they protect their own interests, we can
protect our own interests through the
Graduate Student Employees Union.

Addendum: Regarding employee status.
On October 13. 1984 at the Hotel Hilton in
Albany, the United University
Professionals’(UUP-the professors'
union) Convention passed this resolution

without dissent: “Be it resolved, that UUP
supports actively the principle that
teaching, research, and graduate assistants
are employees entitled to seek collective
rights."
