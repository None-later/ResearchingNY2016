Final debate -
«Front Page

Mondale argued during the
debate that he remains committed
to a strong defenée and a military
budget “which would increase
our nation's strength by - in real
terms - by double that of the
Soviet Union."

But he acknowledged that he
has opposed the 3-1 long-range
bomber, saying. “for 15 years the
Soviet Union has been preparing
to meet the B-l. The secretary of
defense himself said it would be a
suicide mission if it were built."

Reagan said. “it's always been
easy to argue for reductions in
defense spending, just as it's easy
to pretend that one can call the
Soviets leaders, as myopponent
has proposed, and persuade them
in a minute to alter the course
they have followed for decades."

On the issue of nuclear arms,
Mondale said he supported a
mutual and veriﬁable nuclear
freeze, “because this ever-rising
arms race madness makes both
nations less secure, it is putting a
hair trigger on the nuclear war.
This Administration, by going in-
to the Star Wars system, is going
to add a dangerous new
escalation. ' ’

President Reagan attacked this
by saying it is “far more
humanitarian to say that now we
can defend against a nuclear war
by destroying missiles instead of
slaughtering millions of people."

He also said he is willing to
share this technology with the
Soviet Union so they can sit down
and discuss how to get rid of all
nuclear weapons. The President
also accused the Carter Ad-
ministration of unilaterally disar-
ming which Mondale did not
refute. but instead said there
would be no unilateral disarma-
ment during his administration.

On the issue of Lebanon,
Reagan said the peacekeepers
withdrew because they were not
able to complete the mission they
were sent to do. A

But Mondale charged that the
administration had reports prior
to the attack on the Marine bar-
racks that claimed 24l U.S. lives.

in the closing statements, Mon-
dale stressed domestic issues from
the previous debate, th esyrength
of the United States, and the
possibility of nuclear war. “it's
time for America to find new
