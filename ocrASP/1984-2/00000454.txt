Don't close the cofﬁn yet. A seeming-
ly lifeless corpse known as the Albany
State women's tennis team wielded it's
winning head again to annihilate
Amherst 6-0 for their ﬁfth victory.

The Danes resurgence was no easy
task. A tough Amherst squad, weaken-
ed in the same manner that Danes have
been. through injuries. provided com-
petitive tennis in six singles matches.
The doubles matches were cancelled to
allow the Amherst players to have
valuable study time for their mid-
semester exams. Another case of student
athletes in Division til: academics over
athletics.’ ’

battle before overtaking Erica Cicero. '
4-6. 6-2, 6-4. The SUNY surprise, Geri

Nancy Farbes surprised Cyndi King

mances on the court. -

Lisa Valins and Nina Cheung were in-
volved in close three-set victories that
displayed their ﬁne resistency and new
found experience. Valins overcame Ann
Ballantino, 7-6. 2-6. 6-2 while Cheung
handed Audrey Frisch. 6-1. 4-6. 6-2
losses to give Albany a 6-0 sweep that
locked up the match without the doubles
competition.

"it was a great psychological lift for
the team." said coach Jim Serbalik.
“They really played well andnhopefully
this will be an indication of the rest of
the season for us."

Following the SUNYACS. the Danes,
meet Union and then on to the State

Last weekend’s performance against
highly-regarded Oneonta State would lead
you to believe that Albany State's men's
soccer team was ready to break out of its
seven-game winless streak against Vassar
on Tuesday. Unfortunately for the Danes,
logic seldom prevails for a losing team.

Against Binghamton and Oneonta.
Albany finally gave back-to-back solid cf-
forts. Despite losing both games. the
Danes showed that they were a team to be
reckoned with. Practices this week have
been crisp and efficient. and the players
were thinking that they could beat Vassar.
thc lOth-rankcd team in the state in Divi-
sion lll. Given these facts, guess who lost
to Vassar. 2-17

"i thought we had it licked," said
Albany Head Coach Bill Schieffelin. “We
played well in practice but we reverted to
playng down to their level. This week has
been indicative of the season we‘ve been
having. We’re not very productive against
weaker teams."

The question is why; why isn’t Albany
beating teams they should be beating? it's
certainly not because of a lack of talent.
nor is it a lack of desire. These players
want to win more than anything. So what
is it?

“1 don't know what goes on in those
kids’ heads." said Schieffelin. “They cer-
Iztinly didn‘t go in with the same attitude
they had against Oneonta. They have to

play with more motivation and intensity to
win."

Yet the Danes played well enough to
beat Vassar. dominating at both ends of
the ﬁeld. What Albany lacks is a killer in-

All season long, the Albany State
women's cross country team has been
competing admirably. surpassing almost
every previous achievement of the teams
before them as well as every goal of their

Dominating is one thing. but putting the
ball into the net is another. Posts were hit.
balls were overrun. and saves were made.
If bad breaks are supposed to even out.
then Albany is due for an outpouring of
lucky breaks for their last three games.

‘_‘I thought we played well." said Scott
Cohen. .“1 don't think that attitude is the
problem with us. Me. Carl (loos). and
other guys were psyched for this game. We

"The offlclalsand I don't seem to 
getting along,” said Cohen. “The yellow”
card wasn't deserved, and l was lucky I V

wasn't red-carded. There were times when
I took the ball.away cleanly’but the guys

would go down. Those are usually called

for yellow cards. The referees should have,
given the whole team a yellow card just to
save time. They were pretty awful." ‘
Schieffelin had stronger words for the"
officiating. “That had to be the worst of-
ficiating l’ve ever seen. We didn't play:
particularly well. but the officiating cer-
tainly set the climate for the game." ' V'
Michael Jasmin got the Danes their only'
goal 42:42 into the first half on a freak
play. Jasmin kicked the ball toward the.
goal. expecting Vassar goalkeeper Scott
O‘Brien to make an easy save. O’Brien
nonchalantly bent down to pick up the
rolling ball. only to have the ball sneak
between his legs. '

Vassar tied the game at one as Alex
Ooms scored at 3:34 into the second
period. Ooms added the winning goal less
than 12 minutes later.

"This was a game that we could have
and should have won." said Schieffelin.
"We've been letting games get away from
us. It‘s very disappointing when you_lose
to a team you should beat." ' _ "

Coming up on Saturday is a game
against RPI. The Engineers have beaten
teams that Albany has lost to. and‘have
been winning their last few games.

“I consider RN to be at a similar level
to Vassar." said Schieffelin. “With a little
more motivation. I would expect it to be a
much better game." D

juries are minor. and White is optimistic
for their quick return to the regular line-
up.

While the tczun that competed on Satur-
day did not quite live tip to the standard it
lllld set earlier in the season, it was by no
means without is own fine performances.
Out of the 77 athletes that completed the
