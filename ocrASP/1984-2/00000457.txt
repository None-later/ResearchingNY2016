WheelChairatlilete Sports a long list of activﬂ'

By Christopher Blomqulst
STAFF WRITER ‘

’ With a hockey stick taped to his
wheelchair, a seven year old boy suffering
from severe paralysis. took a shot at play-
ing hockey last week. t

His instructor was Rob Pipia, a junior at
SUNYA, who was participating in a sports
exposition at Hudson
Valley Community
College. ‘ ,

The boy, said Pipia.
left a lasting impression.
“He couldn’t control
(the chair) that well, but
he tried. It was a form of therapy, mental-
ly and physically, to build up his syn-
chronization.He was'really enjoying it,"
Pipia recalled. “Then you think if .these
programs didn't exist, maybe the kid
wouldn‘t get the chance," said Pipia, who
is a wheelchair athlete.

“If you can't expand on the positive
things, the negative things just consume
you,” says Pipia. Pipia is attempting to ex-
pand on the positive by getting involved as
Vice President of University Action for the
Disabled (UAD), working as an intern in
the accounting office, being a member of'
State Quad’s Judicial Borad, and worship-
ping Don Vito Corleone, the main
character
Godfather. .

While St. Elsewhere silently played on
his color t.v., Pipia, clad in a grey and
white plaid shirt, bluejeans, and a pair of
Nikes, sat in his electric wheelchair and
discussed himself and his involvment with

.the world so far.

Although UAD’s general purpose is “to
make things on campus a little more ae-
cessible to the disabled student," Pipia
said his main interest with the organization
is building up the program of wheelchair
athletics. In his freshman year, he joined
the UAD hockey team and "played for a

really long "ne, tnen became captain."

Last lyear the team played the State
Quad RA's, an event Pipin hopes to repeat
November 16. “I would like to make this
an annual event. Students get closer to the
RA's with this game, and it gets students
and RA's more in touch. It‘s a way to br-
ing RA’s and disabled students together,"
he said.

Under Pipia's influence, UAD is look-
ing to open up more sports to the disabled
community. Pipia is now working on
adapting the bowling alley for wheelchairs.
All that is necessary, he said, is to build a
ramp, which he estimates would cost about
$l00. “What I would like to do is get
something started so when I leave there
'will be something more for disabled
students," he stated. .

Pipia went to a high school for the
disabled near his Elmont, Long Island
home. The hockey players there “were
really into it," he said, adding that last
week's sports exhibition at Hudson Valley
Community College was a good oppor-
tunity for him to tncet with young kids
who never had the opportunity to par-
ticipate in wheelchair athletics.

Wheelchair hockey is not as popular as
other sports for the disabled, such as
basketball or football, but Pipia said he
expects this to chattge. He explained that
hockey is there adaptable than other sports
because the stick can either be held or at-
tached to the chair. In other sports where
hand coordination is necessary, such as

‘basketball, quadrapelegics and other
disabled people cannont play.

Because hockey can be played by more
disabled people, Pipia believes its
popularity will increase. “It builds egos
and helps kids develop mentally," he
added.

Pipia’s involvment with UAD goes
beyond athletics. “This year we're
shooting for a major campaign of

awareness,” he stated. One concern is
preventing vandalism to the facilities for
the disabled on this catnpus, an issue UAD
is apparently ttot lighting alone. “This
year we've gotten great support from (SA
President) Rich Schaffer and SA,” Pipia
said.

“Students here generally have a good at-
titude (toward the disabled cotnmunity),
but there's always lessons to be learned. If
we can break down some of the barriers
it's best for everyone," he said.

Pipia said he believes these barriers are
more physical than social, meaning that
more adaptations for‘ wheelchairs such'as
electric doors are needed.

However, he said that the SUNYA cam

Discovering ancient cities in the
jungles of Latin America doesn't
sound like everyday work for a
University professor, but when
SUNYA areheologist Richard
Leventhal found one this summer
it wasn't quite the same as a
Hollywood action movie either.

Leventhal, a Harvard graduate,
has been conducting research in
Latin America for the last ten
years. He is involved, he said,
with many projects, and is also
organizing his own expedition,
“The Southern Belize Ar-
cheological Project." It was while
working on this project that he
discovered a missing link in his
regional study of the Maya
civilation.

According to Leventhal he had
been to the sight of the discovery
at least ten times before and never
noticed it. “This is due to the
thickness of thejungles,” he snid,
“you generally can't see more
than ﬁve feet in front of you.”

“A discovery like this one is
fairly rare in occurence,“ he said,
comparing it to “finding
Rockefeller Center in New York
City and then being able to ex-
pand from there.”

The city, which villagers and
expedition members named ‘Ux-
benka’ for “old place" or “an-
cient place," dates back from
about 400 AD. to 800 A.D.,
Leventhal said, and is located
near Santa Cruz, not far from the
Guatemalan border. The city, he
said, is filled with monuments
and tombstones glorifying the

: Prat finds ancient May

rulers of the Mayan culture.

Leventhal said that only 30 per- 0

cent of the hieroglyphics found
can'be thoroughly read, and that
another 30-40 percent can be
'generally understood, while the
rest is undecipherable.

Leventhal said he is not a
specialist in hieroglyphics and his
interest is to “focus on civiliza-
tion from an archeologic perspec-
tive." He said “the writings are
very important because they were
found in context and you get a
much more thorough understan-
ding of (Mayan) culture when it is
found this way."

“It’s a rarity to find (a site) in
context, even when an ar-
chaelogist gets to it it has usually
already been looted," said An-
thropology doctoral candidate
Peter Dunham, who accom-
panied Leventhal.

Looters find a site first,
Dunham said, because they have
more money for exploration since
they sell the rare objects they find
at great profit.

The discovery is of significant .

importance in a theory that
Leventhal is working on, which
entails studying areas as small
regions and then analyzing the in-
terdependence regions have with
each other.

This particular city is one of
five or six cities within a ten to fif-
teen kilometer range, Leventhal
said, making the region a good
case study of regional
civilizations.

The unusual thing about the
Maya civilizations is that no

single city is more dominant than

'any of the others. “There is no

central city," according to Leven-
thal, "It is like having five or six
Albanys within a 10 kilometer
range."

“Since there is no dominant ci-
ty we have to begin to examine
social, political, economic and
religious interaction between the
cultures," 'he said. Such a study|
Leventhal believes, would reveal a
part ofthe Mayan culture that has
been hidden from modern

'studies.

Leventhal said that although
the discovery may make his work
sound exciting, “In reality ar-
cheology is a lot of drudgery and
hard work." Living conditions in
Latin America can take getting
used to, he said, noting the lack
of bathrooms and electricity, as
well as having to learn to sleep in
hammocks.

According to Leventhal an ex-
pedition can go on a hundred

something worthwhile is found.
Occasionally ﬁnding something
keeps the group motivated, he
said.

Leventhal has applied for a
$150,000 grant from the govern-
ment funded National Science
Foundation and said he hopes to
continue his project this spring.
But if the grant is approved
Leventhal will not be working on
Uxbenka. Instead, he will con-
tinue to work his way through the
other cities to be researched D

Pregnant college women often opt

By Jacquie Clark

"It seems that if they (women) are col-
lege students and they are pregnant, they
are more likely to get an abortion than to
continue the pregnancy,” — Planned
Parenthood official, Albany.

According to statistics gathered by Plan-
ned Parenthood in 1980, 45 percent of
pregnancies in New York State atnong
women ages 20-24 were terminated by
abortion.

Planned Parenthood literature reveals
,hat of the L6 million women who got
abortions in I980 in the U.S., one third of
them were between the ages of 20 and 24.
One staff member at Planned Parenthood
asserts that the largest bracket of clientele
which they serve is the 20-24 age group.

An abortion “is any procedure or in—
tervention that results in the termination
of a pregnancy," according to Planned
Parenthood literature.

Technically. said Sandra Walek-
MiMura, Director of Community Services

for Planned Parenthood, the process is an
extraction of the contents of the uterus. It
is an uncomfortable process, she said, and
anesthesia is administered.

According to one SUNYA student who
had an abortion and asked not to be iden-
tified, the process was, in her case. very
painful, although it wasn't supposed to be.
She attributed the pain, in part, to the
shape of her uterus. ‘

The operation was performed during the
first tritucstcr of her pregnancy and took
between IS and 20 minutes, she said. in-
cluding time for the anesthesia. She said
she was given a local anesthesia and was
charged $190 for the operation.

Another SUNYA student who found
out from a SUNYA infirmary pregnancy
test that she was pregnant said she was
referred to an Albany-area gynecologist,
who was “very nice" and helped her a
great deal.

She said that the doctor, knowing her
financial difficulties, charged her $200 —

half the price for her abortion.

The process. with a local anesthesia,
caused a lot of pain but took less than one-
half hour, she said. According to the stu-
dent. she was ‘Iuid-up’ for about one day,
and suffered no “radical” changes in her
system following the operation.

She was a freshman at the time.

According to at least one women who's
had an abortion, the best place for preg-
nant women considering abortions to seek
guidance is a doctor or Planned Paren-
thood. Never trust classified ads. she said.

In the Albany area, Planned Paren-
thood. 259 Lark Street, is one place where
pregnant women may be advised on all
aspects of pregnancy. The Upper Hudson
Division of Planned Parenthood handles
pregnancy tests and discusses options with
pregnant women.

If the woman decides to continue the
pregnancy, explained a Planned Paren-

Ithood staff member, they can recommend

doctors who offer pro-natal care services.

Clark declares U.S. compulsory education ‘faceless’

By Johanna Clancy

Rather than making career decisions at
18 or 2], students should have to make
:hoices when they are younger so they
don’t grow bored with school and drop-
out, said UCLA Soeiologist Burton Clark
in a speech at SUNYA Tuesday.

"A 15 or l6 year old should have a
choice of education," said the world

rcknowned specialist in comparative
higher education.
Clurk culled compulsory educntton

“faceless,” because only a common
education is taught. He said more speciliz-
ed schools permit a higher qualitiy of
education, and cited the Bronx School of
Science as an example.

American college education offers
enough variety, Clark said, because it of-
fcrs open access, functional programs, and
[research programs together.

Likewise, he maintained. primary
education serves its purpose in the U.S. by
adequately providing a general education.

Therefore, he argued, secondary, or
high school education is the weak link in
the American school system. “We're not
doing something quite right In the handl-
ing of education," he said, explaining that
secondary education in the U.S. serves as
an extension of elementary school, rather
than as a link to college.

In Ettropc, Clark said, secondary educa-
tion serves as a time for exploration, when
students can decide their own educational
direction.

Some European students choose to go to
vocational school to learn a trade. In
America. these schools, Clark explained,
are thought of as dumping grounds. While
75 percent of European students prefer
vocational school. he said, only 24 percent
choone that same path in the U.S.

 

 

Burton Clark
Make carotir choice at 16

for abortion

If adoption or foster care is chosen as an

option, the staff can recommend a proper .

agency. In the case of a woman who wants
an abortion, Planned Parenthood recom-
mends an area doctor. '

Payment, said a Planned Parenthood
staff member, is based on a scale in which
high school and college students pay less
than full-time professionals. The
spokeswoman said that Planned Paren-
thod would never deny services to anyone
unable to pay. Their prices are generally
lower than gynecologists', she added.

After the options are discussed, Planned
Parenthood refers the woman to a doctor,
said the staff member. The doctors have
their own fees, she said, but they generally
vary between $200 and $500, with abor-
tions involving hospital stays costing ap-
)roximatcly $l000.

According to Planned Parenthood
literature, the average price for abortions
.n the U.S. in 1980 was $190.

The Schenectady division of Planned
Parenthood currently is a "health care
center that provides abortion services,"
Walek-MiMura said.

Planned Parenthood also offers con-
fidential clinical services, including
)regnnney tests, on the SUNYA campus,
the noted.

On campus pregnancy tests are available
at the Student Health Services building. A
pregnancy test costs $4.50 and can be ob-
tained by making an appointment. All in-
formation is eonfidentiai and results are
available the same day. If a pregnant
woman chooses to have an abortion, Out
Patient Services will recommend an
obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN).

_ Albany Right-to-Lifc Party spokesper-
son Rita Burke said the group, opposed to
legal abortion, was seeking to have restric-
tions such as parental consent and no
Medicaid funding for abortions put in
place.

There are also groups existing that sup-
