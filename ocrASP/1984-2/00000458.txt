Big hurricane damages foretold

until people, nature can coexist

By J.c. Hayden
Humanity must learn to live

with nature and not try to control

it if hurricane damage and injury
is to be held to a minimum, accor-
ding to National Hurricane
Center Director Neil Frank, who
spoke Tuesday as part of a
SUNYA lecture series.

The National Hurricane Center
is responsible for tracking storms
in the Caribbean and on the
Eastern seaboard of the U.S., and
is responsible for trying to deter-
mine the path of the storms so
authorities can be alerted of the
dangers“

Sciences Research Center and the

vironmental Conservation.

Frank used a I938 storm to il-
lustrate how dangerous hur-
ricanes can be. This particular
storm was spotted off the east
coast of the Bahamas. andI thirty
hours later ripped across Long
Island with 60 mile per hour
winds.

Other hurricanes have ventured
this far north, including three
storms which washed away parts
of Long Island in the early 1800’s.
All three occurred within a IS
year span.

Hurricanes, Frank said, are
caused when a large, cold air mass
comes down from Canada and
combines with a warm southern
air mass in the tropics.

They are comprised of three
major elements: wind, rain and
storm surge. Storm surge takes
place when waves rush up on the
shore, excavate sand, and pull it
back out to sea, Frank explained.

The monster storms can reach
as far North as the Canadian
border, Frank said. “Maine is
susceptible.” he added, “but not
as likely as the southern New
England states," including New
York.

destruction during a hurricane are
wind and rain, but. Frank said,
along the coastal areas. in addi-
tion to” the wind and rain,
residents are also confronted with
the problems of storm surges.

Most beachfront properties are
built on piers made of either
avood or concrete as opposed to a
slab concrete foundation, Frank
said. This means of construction,
he explained, leaves the building
highly susceptible to damage.

Storm surge, said Frank. can
remove sand from beaches to a
depth of IS feet. When the sand is
removed. the building is left sit-
ti-..g on sticks, and waves can then
knock the piers over and the
house is reduced to ruins.

Frank said he is not opposed to
on beach properties. but that he is
opposed to building codes that
allow the construction of these
homes without any precautions
against hurricanes.

He also said people should not
be permitted to build homes
directly on beaches. If the homes
were built further from the
water’s edge the potential danger
and loss would not be as great, he
said.

During the late 19605 and early
19705 a number of ﬂoods occur-

Inland, the major forces of

Rape seen as violent crime; expert
urges caution even among friends

By Laurl Cole

Speaker: When you think of the word 'rape,’
what words come to mind?"

Audience reply: "Violence." "Fear." “Force.”
“Restraint. ' ’

The audience. in this case. gave what profes-
sional Rape Crisis Counselors consider to be an ex-
:cllent response, considering the fact that most peo-
ple regard rape as a sexually based crime. This is not
so, the speaker asserted. ,

Rape is a violent crime — a crime of anger and
hostility according to Barbara Moynihan, Director
of the New Haven Rape Crisis serving in
Schenectady.

Speaking last Thursday about “Rape on Cam-
pus.” Moynihan told the audience at Schenectady
County Community College, that one of the main
problems concerning rape is society’s lack of
understanding of the crime. To illustrate her point.
'she described the attitudes of some sex offenders
she’d spoken to.

“Rape is a crime of violence, (it's an) intrusion
of the most personal kind, second only to homocide
in its effects on the victim," she said.

Many people consider rape to be a sexually based
crime. This is a myth according to Moynihan, who
has worked with sex offenders in a maximum
security prison. Sex offenders often speak of their
victims as objects, she explained. “They seek to
degrade, humiliate and» overpower their victim —
|most can never describe their victim after the
crime." Many are sexually dysfunctional at the
time, as well, she said.

Rapists do not discriminate, either, she said, ad-
ding, “What a person has on has nothing to do with
the possibility of their being chosen as a victim by a
rapist." Although the act may be pre-meditated.
the victim chosen is not. "They are selected on the
basis of opportunity.” not sexual preference, she
said.

Moynihan suggested being self-aware and being
assertive as two ways of combatting sexual nssuuit
before it happens. When a student is walking on
campus, and a stranger approaches from the op-
posite direction, the student should look the
stranger In the eyes. Let the stranger know they‘re
alert — do not daydream, recommended
Moynihan. Vulnerability is what you want to avoid,
she said.

AccOrding to statistics in Connecticut. the
highest number of rapes occur beginning at 4 p.m.

and continuing until after 2 a.m. In spite of this.
she said, “We tend to be less careful during the day
than at night." »

People between the ages of IO and I9 are the
most vulnerable to rapists. The second most
vulnerable age group is between 20 and 29. The
most common age for offenders is between 20 and
29. The next most common is 30-39.

Since typical college aged students fall into both
these sets of categories, students ofall ages must be
wary. And since it is also reported that at least 60
percent of all rapes are acquaintance rapes.
students should use caution in who they befriend
while walking late at night.

Moynihan suggested that students think ahead.
They need to remember that this crime “can hap-
pen to anyone," she said. Moynihan recommended
that students make “a plan to deal with the
possibility of being accosted ."

“There IS no specific prescription for resistance
-— each situation must be judged individually. but
whatever you do, you should not compromise your
life," she said. Since the offender is used to using
weapons, the victim must be sure of his or her own
proﬁciency with a weapon.

Moynihan recommends trusting intuition in a
precarious situation. Take responsibility for
yourself — “trust people very selectively." she said.

Perhaps the most alarming and hostility—
provoking topic Moynihan addressed is the fact
that women are now forced to re-arrange their lives
to make provision for safety. “This threatens
women’s educational opportunities.” she said.
When women have to arrange courses, tests.
meetings and studying time around the issue of
staying safe, "they are being denied some of their
most fundamental rights as human beings," she
asserted.

Moynihan recommended many possible campus-
wide programs. Some of her suggestions were:
escort services, self-defense courses, emergency
phones, better lighting. rape crisis hotlines and
educational talks at orientation time.

In addition, Moynihan urged faculty members to
“be perceptive." Approach a student who seems
disorganized, bruised or severly anxiety-ridden.

According to Moynihan. administrators often ig-

Inore the ever increasing problem of sexual assualt

on campus. Non-acknowledgement “reinforces the
notion that its only rape.’ '
