Disabled students achieve goals
through perseverance and pride

 

By Patrice Johnson .
“Prejudice paralyzes the heart
And, it is this numbness
Which denies all feeling of

life."

You have inspired and
spiritually uplifted many in-
dividuals by
progressing and
succeeding in
various areas of
your life. You
are not allowing
your physical
inconveniences to restrict or stunt
your social, spiritual and educa-
tional growth. In a society, where
you have been labeled a minority
because of your disability, you
have learned to struggle and
strive; knowing the negative
powers of defeat. Although you
may have encountered the many
dark facets of life throughout
your journey, you have retained
your ﬂames of perseverance and
pride.

There is no doubt that our
society is composed of many in-
dividuals who tend to overlook
the forgotten. And sometimes,
you may have encountered this
selfishness, feeling that in-
dividuals are out for themselves.
But somehow your inner
strength has carried you through
the thick of the night. and you
have not accepted defeat. Realiz-
ing that one of the many pro-
blems you face is adjusting and
adapting to the mainstream of

Beyond
the
Majority

society, I praise you. Not only
have you illustrated the power of
adjustment, but in doing so. you
have portrayed character as
you’ve become a more productive
member of society.

Accepting your physical im-
pairment, has not stopped you
from maximizing your potentials.
Your being here at SUNYA con-
ﬁrms it. As you seek to enrich
your life academically and
develop new relationships, you in-
itiate growth. A growth that no
physical condition can ever han-
dicap. As you openly participate
and involve yourself in many ac-
tivities, you share yourself while
portraying your will to be
recognized. You have not chosen
seclusion, b"' you have given up
your seat in me corner and have
actively included yourself.

Although our walks of life may
differ and our roads may vary. I
understand the prejudices that
lurk in the hearts of people. I
know what it is like to be an
underdog and non-recognized.
Yet, I know the power of action.
You have not waited for someone
to water you in order for growth,
but you Itave watered yourself.
Therefore, it is you who must be
responsible for your inner life in a
society which strongly depicts
literal selfishness.

Sometimes, as most minorities,
you have been treated unjustly
(just because you are a minority).
[t is you who must right the
wrong. It is you who must con-
tinue to just the unjust. You must
dare when others don't, and live
when others die within. As stated
sometimes, life “is the survival of
the fittest,” and only the fit-
test/strongest will survive. You
are responsible for your survival.
Before we can depend on others
we must know how to rely and de-
pend on ourselves.

You ltave given me a picture;

'wanted to

an insight to the beauty of life, as
you project determinism. In pro-
gressing, you have inspired me to
progress and press forward. Your
genuity has taught me other

aspects of truth. Your reaching' '

out to establish social variations
and relationships has encouraged
me to welcome others who may
ethnically differ from me and
who’s lifestyle varies.

Your inspiration has encourag-
ed many minorities to submerge
their passivity. As you attain your
goals of optimism, but realism,
you inspire others’ instincts to
achieve. I praise you, not only for
your power to win at life, but

because you have not allowed'

some physical inconvenience to
handicap your mind, and
moreover, your heart. When I
think of the handicapped. I don't
think of you, but of the many
who search for outer beauty in-
stead of and before searching
within. I think of those who have
yielded to the prejudices and
discriminativeness of their hearts.
I think of those who incorporate
mythologies and negative
stereotypes of people into their
minds, which constitute negative
attitudes and behaviors. I think of
those who do not make some
aspect of their lives available to
others who physically or cultural-
ly differ from them. They are the
handicaps, for their lives are crip-
pled and shut off until truths and
pureness are no longer available
to them, instead. ignorance.

I praise you. I praise you for
the power and beauty of life you
give to all those who have shared
your discriminations and ex-
ploitations. I praise you for conti-
nuing when you sometimes
stabilize. Unlike,
disability, you have proven abili-
ty. And unlike disable, you are
able. And very much nble.
Thanks! I‘l
