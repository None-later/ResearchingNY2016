'ow often have you walked out of a
concert-feeling that you've not only
seen an incredible musical perfor-
‘ ance and had a lot of fun, but experienc-
d something that inspires your spirit and
akes you feel better about the world.
hat's a lot to ask for, but last Saturday
ight at the Troy Music Hall the Paul
inter Consort delivered

 

 

  
 
 

Louis Lewis

 

Paul Winter has for years composed and
played a unique brand of music that brings
human beings closer to nature. During this
‘oncert he called upon his stock of
haracters — whales, wolves, birds, the sun
and the winter solstice, some on tape and
others just in the imagination — to mystify
and delight the audience.

Musically, the Paul Winter Consort is
hard to classify. It's a unique kind of fusion,
that brings together folk, classical and tradi.
tional music with the sounds of jazz and

pop. What runs through all these different
E elements is a deep sensitivity to the sounds

of nature and the talent to express these

sounds to the appreciation of human ears. _

"Ti/i,

‘ ble joined in, and soon the audience caught
_on and began howling too. Suddenly the
music hall exploded. with hundreds of peo-
ple howling over the the sounds of the lone
wolf. When the piece came to a close with
a last burn and howl, the audience broke
'out in laughter and applause.

Winter had certainly made his point
about appreciating the wolves and their
sense of ritual.

Animal music was not the only thing

that made this concert special. The musi-
cians playing with Paul Winter were ex-
ceptional, both for their skill and their
sensitivity.
' Many of the pieces played during the
show were from an upcoming album of
music inspired by the sun. One of the more
unusual pieces, Sunshine and Shadows,
was an attempt to balance out the bright
and cheery (as in sunshine) theme of the
album. Before he put his lips to the reed
Winter warned that what was about to
happen was "totally spontaneous.”

Suddenly a deep sound arose from the
back corner of the balcony. Unseenp a
'haunting, bluesy contrabassoon (which
'sounds something like a bass saxophone)

i

It’s a unique kind of fusion, that brings together folk,

i" classical, and traditional music with the sounds of jazz

 

The cars in the Music Hall were especial-
ly appreciative Saturday night. The Troy
music Hall is reknowned for being one of
the most acoustically perfect concert halls
in the world. Combine the intensity of the
hull with the intensity of the Paul Winter
Consort and you have the makings of an
extraordinary experience.

One of the highlights of the evening was
the music which combined recordingss of
animal sounds with human improvisation.
After the opening song. Winter introduced
a piece called A Lullaby from the Croat

' r\ lather Whale for the Baby Seal Pups.

A Lullaby opened with a recording of a
Humpback Whale blowing. The sad. haun-
ting sound is echoed by Winter's soft
soprano saxophone. Winter's improvisa-
tion evokes the beauty and pathos of this
bizarre giant creature.

The whale blows. spanning milions of
years and miles with a cry that pierces and
hypnotizes the still audience, An interplay
begins with the whale and Paul Hally. the
‘onsort's pianist. The fast, rhythmic piano
vcaves in and out of the whale's drawn out
‘ries. Hally's playing is a kind of free-form

» ’lassical sound, both blending with and

’ontrasting to the Humpback‘s call.
Another remarkable composition in-
pired by the animal kingdom was Wolf
yes. Winter introduced the piece by
iscussing some of the reasons for humans
) appreciate wolves. He explained that
olves are not dangerous to humans. and
but from their howling we can learn to ap»
rccialc the sense of ritual that binds us to
to natural world. Wolf Eyes arose out of
1 experience he had when finding himself
cc to face with a wolf, an impression he
id he would never forget.
Like the whale music, Woll'Eyr-s opened
ith a chilling recording of a wolf howling
r the night. Winter be {an to improvise on
e fading howl, blowing a slow, heavy
. ues melody. His wilting sax filled the hall
ith bittersweet notes that seemed to wrap
)und you and draw you into the Wolf»
olate night.
' fter an improvisation by the t‘ltltt't‘
'inble. the howling faded back in with
~no accompanirm‘nl. Winter began
ing, almost chanting in tune with the

ra minute of this, he looked out and
’ nd how long has it been since
good bowl,” and began howling
the wolf. The rest of the ensem-

 

began a haunting improvisation which cap-
tuer the sense of mystery and anticipa-
tion, the dark and seemy underside of the
cheery sunshine. With the acoustics of the
hall, every note was heard, and the au-
dience was transfixed by this blues coming
out of the dim and distant shadows.

Back on stage. Winter's soprano sax join-
ed the deep bassoon in a duet improvisa-
tion. Winter danced playfully around the
deep and powerful bassoon; creating an in-
terplay of blues. The piece shifted into a
solo improvisation by Winter. whose
sweet. jar/.y playing and pure sound was
exquisite in that way that only great jazz
can be.

Winter was joined by Eugene Freisen's
boppy walking cello. Frcisen is a gifted
musician, who did just about anything to
make sound with his cello. His playing was
probably the most outstanding of anyone's
in the group. He plucked melodies with
lightening fast fingers. bowed long and
gentle, or fast and violent. snapped strings
into the cello for dramatic rhythms and
harmonies, and somctuncs slapped and
honor ed the bow oil the strings to become
tln‘ Pt‘t't ussion settion of the ensemble. in
cycry facet he was .i gilled musician and
irnprovisor.

The fourth member of the Consort is
French Horn player John Clarke, The horn
is not really a soloist's insrurncnt. but the
rich, mellow sound. although subtle. added
a different musical dimension to the
performance.

One ol the last songs performed. called
Midnight. brought out the true spirit of the
Paul Winter Consort. A village song from
West Africa. AIR/night quickly became an
ecstatic singva-lung with the entire
audience.

Midnight, like the animal music. and like
."l Winter's firm/n. a song inspired by a
winter «irlslitc‘ in the Soviet Union and
written with the idea of transcending
political differences through nature,
demonstrated what Paul Winter sung in
the tliorus ol the ilosing song, Common
(inn/nil:

In a circle of Ir'ir'nds
In .r circle of sound
.‘\l/ our voices will blend
When we touch higher ground

Musically. intellectually and spiritually
.rn evcning with the Paul Winter Consort
in the Troy Music Hall was about the most
one could expect from any concert.

Heller’s God Doesn’t
Know Any Good Jokes

he word which rises most quickly
I to mind at the end (and the beginn-
ing. and the middle) of Joseph
I'lcller's newest novel. God Knows (Alfred
A. Knopf. [0.05) is self-indulgent. Thé
critically acclaimed author of Catch-.72
may have something to say with this latest
work. but if he does, he soon finds himself
too bogged down in egotism and one-liners
to make it either very clear. or very
meaningful.

 

John Keenan

 

God Knows is the story of David, ("yes.
that 'David.” the bookjacket burbles en‘
thusiastically). David, King of the lsraclites.
slayer of Goliath et.al.

It seems. as the novel relates. that David
is near death. and his two sons, Adonijah
and Solomon, are jockeying for the suc~
cessorship. David himself touldn't care
less; he's awaiting an apology from God
for killing his first son by Bathshcba. as
punishment for David's adultery (the book
really goes much more smoothly if the
reader has some knowledge of the Old
'l‘estarnent.)

The David Heller presents us with is a
bitter one, who has sort of an overview on
the whole history (and future) of the
world, a neat dcvicc which enables Heller
to give him lines like "I'll let you in on a
secret about my son Solomon: he was dead
serious when he proposed cutting that
baby in half. that pull. [swear to God, The
dumb son of a bitch was trying to be fair,
not shrewd."

 

Yes, the book is funny. sometimes very

funny, but it's always the snickering type
of funny usually associated with a dirty
joke. There are some prime bits in there
that you might want to remember, so as to
tell your friends ( My favorite, for exam-
pie, is when God tells Moses that he's go-
ing to destroy the lsraelites. and Moses
begs him not to. pleading that God would
look really stupid back in Egypt for taking
his chosen people this far and then destroy-
ing'them. Since God doesn't want to look
like a laughingstock back in Egypt, he
ielents): but there are bits in Truly
Iirsteless lulu-s that you might want to tell
your friends about, too. and that book
doesn't ttlllll‘ with lowph l ir'llr‘r"~ prestige.

Maybe llclli'r fell he‘d nussed out on a
career in stand-up tourmly: the string of
onc~liners and "Ill Old testament jokes .uc
annoying both in their smugne» and their

'stupidity. David rs .rn intretlrbly hip

llcbron htttg‘ he seems to have stepped out
ol the inner tity, (humtcri/ali'on is ig»
norcd: David the character \l\'\\‘t‘\l'ltl the
mod depth. r~ ultimately .h unfinished .1»
the others. Neither Rathshcba nor Solomon
is given any time to really develop; and
Solmon. in one of the strangest quick-
changes in history. becomes a moron, in-
tent on being king most of all because he
want “peacocks and apes" for his palace.
The most important thing we learn about
David's trusted lieutenant loab is his fond-
ness for the fifth rib.

Overall, the impression left by God
Knows is an unpleasant one, funny in a
smarrny sense, but neither deep or even in-
teresting enough to salvage it from being
just another National Lampoon.
