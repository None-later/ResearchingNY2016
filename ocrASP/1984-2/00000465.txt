“The endowment funds are
held by investment companies
who make investment analyses
while holding the funds in
banks," said SASU Vice Presi-
dent of Community Colleges An-
drew Chin. -

“SUNY gets endowment funds
through donations, 'the majority
of which are from Buffalo State
when it was still a private
school," Chin said. “These funds
are managed by the two invest-
ment companies MacKay and
Shields. and Reich and Tang.
MacKay and Shields holds its
funds in M & T bank of Buffalo,
and Reich and Tang holds its
funds in Marine Midland," he
explained.

Many of the largest single Fund
investments are in companies that
are active in South Africa, accor-
ding to SASU. The largest
holding of the Fund in a private
corporation is $3.8 million in the
stock of IBM, which. has served
the South African Departments
of Prisons, Interior. Defense and

w National Education, as well as a.

Senior Cliff Niebling said his
first concern is “who is my ad—

" visor." He explained that his

department (Economics) is
undergoing a lot of changes and

I with a constant flow of adjunct

professors and visiting pro-
fessors, he has to “check a new
advisor list every time."

Niebling added, “I expect that

‘ ill make Some stupid error. or go

into something blindly, that they
(his adviser) will point it out to
me." This has not been possible,
he said, since his advisor has
changed every semester.

llarry Geffner, a senior with a
double major in English and

_ Communications, claimed, "Ad-

visement in this school is a joke."
He said he is dissatisfied with

‘ both of his departmcnls' :Idvisc-

mcnt prognuns.
“The Communications depart-
ncut is not bad if you don’t mind

Other major holdings by the
Fund include General Motors and
Ford, which held the second and
third largest direct investments of
all U.S. ﬁrms in South Africa and
Namibia in 1983.

“SASU has brought the issue
before the SUNY Board of
Trustees for several years. Their
response has always been the
Sullivan Principles," Chin said.
The Sullivan Principles are a
voluntary code of conduct
drafted in SouthAfrica in i976. It
calls for non-segregation in the
work place and fair employment.
These priniciples, according to
Chin. “are only principles, have
no form of enforcement, and
make no demands for change in
the fundamental structure of
apartheid."

“Presently, the strategy (of
SASU) for this year is to work
with student governments and
groups to divest, even symbolical-
ly. like not using lBM com-
puters," Chin said. “Two days
ago SUNY Binghamton's SA
passed resolutions in favor of
SUNY divcstments and in con-
damnation of Marriot Hotel,

'which runs the food service
there," and which Binghamton
SA President Margie chfter has
accused of supporting apartheid.

"Main campuses like New
Paltz and Oswego are aware, but
most (SUNY) campuses aren't
really aware" of the issue of
divestiture. Chin said. SASU is
arranging for speakers like Jor-
dan and others to go to various
campuses to “raise con-
sciousness." In addition, he said.
SASU is planning a lobbying day
on a divestiture bill sponsored by
Buffalo Assemblyman Arthur
Eve. .

Another long term project at
Buffalo. McAlevey said, is to
have two banking machines in-
stalled on campus that would pro-
vide access to Gold Dome and
other banks as well as M & T and
Marine Midland. "We can't kick
Marine Midland off campus.
These machines will allow
students to divest themselves —
we want to give students the op-
tion and then run education cam-
paigns," McAlcvey said.

In a June I984 letter to
delegates of the SASU Con-
ference, Chin stated, “Apartheid
is an authorized institution of

discrimination on the grounds of_

skin color, commanded by statute
and integrated into every facet of
life. Divestment is our most effec-
tive weapon against apartheid and
we must become adept in its use."

advisement quality

is staffed this semester by I0
department faculty members,
who advise students in place of
serving on academic committees,
according to Judy Barlow, Direc-
tor of Undergraduate Studies in
the English Department.

"Obviously 550 majors can not
be advised by to people." she
said. and shc pointed out the im-
portance of the informal advise-
mcnt than students are urged to
seek out among professors in the
department.

Some students did choose this
route on their own.

Junior Mike Herder is a
Physics major. Instead of going
to an assigned advisor. he said. "I
got advice from different teachers
and put it together on my own."

Howic Lindcnbaum said advice
from peers is also helpful. “I got
better advisement from students
that I know; \vho’wcrc already
majors (in business)." However,
he cited no specific problems with
his adviser.

Dorf, the senior who wanted to
know what advisement is. ex-
plaincd that his sessions with his
zidvisor usually juSt involve the
signing of his program curd. Hc
describch his first meeting with
his assigned advisor in the
Psychology department: “The
first thing he said was 'unlcss you
have some very specific questions.
let's not waste your time or
mine.”’

Since then, Dorf said, "I have

do us Don Corleone.

Pipia said he once made a
friend by reciting an entire scene
from the movie’s script with him.
They then read passages of the
book aloud daily and held a
"Murio Puzo Octobcrl‘cst Party"
last year. A photograph of Pipia
and his friends dressed as "the
mob" stands on his bedside table.
THE DON is also the name on
the back of his hockey jersey.

During the interview Pipia's

school and who has the same

spoken to other professors who
have given'me some advice. As
far as regulations. I find them out
on my own.”

Another student defended
faculty advisors. although he
would not name his own depart-
ment. He said, “It's not theirjob.
They feel they have other respon-
sibilities and they don’t have the
time.”

He accused the administration
of using professors as advisors as
a “cheap way out" and asserted.
"We should have professional.
paid advisement."

According to Gibson, CUE ad-
visors go through a concentrated
training program each year. while
faculty advisers are supplied with
the Undergraduate Bulletin along
with a copy of the Undergraduate
Academic Policy manual.

Howcvcr, sophomore Michele
Besslcr said she believes "a facul-
ty advisor will know the courses
and the level of difficulty." and
would be able to give “more in-
sightful advice."

Scott Brcuncr, :1 scnior in the
History department said. "From
what I‘ve heard most faculty ad-
visors just sign the card." His ex-
perience, however. was with an
advisor "who was concerned, and
made sure I had courses that
fulfilled my requirements." [3

telephoned. When the talk was
over, Pipia said. “We’re helping
each other through this. He
boosts my confidence and l boost
his. It's not corny though, it's
something we have to do."

He later returned to the topic
of friends. “I have so many
friends. The only way I’ll make it
is to have the greatest friends.
Your friends really make you.”
he said. He added, “If I was to
list all the friends I have here, you
