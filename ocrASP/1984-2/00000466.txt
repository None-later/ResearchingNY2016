New Council rule to crack dewn

By Andrea Corson

Central Council members who miss
more than ﬁve of their committee meetings
without an excuse will now lose their
Council seats under a rules amendment ap-
proved Wednesday night.

This expulsion can only be overriden by
a two-thirds majority of vote of Council,
according to the
amendment.

Under the previous central

policy, members with poor '
attendance records had to councl'
be impeached, and a hear- ‘
ing had to be held before a decision could
be made regarding the member's status.
- According to Council Chair Mitch Feig,
this change was made because every now
and then there are some Council members
who don’t show up to their committee
meetings due to their “lackadaisical at-
titude.” Now it has been made “more
possible for negligent council members to
be impeached,” said Feig.

The previous policy on committee
meetings, Feig said was “very vague." It
“really had no rules on absences," he
asserted.

The amendment was passed by a vote of
25-5-0.

The regular policy on Council meetings
was not changed during this meeting, but,
Feig said, it most probably will be changed
during the next meeting.

The policy as it stands right now, ex-
plained Feig, is that if a Council member
misses more than three full Council
meetings in a row or a total of five, that
member would be referred to Council’s ln-
ternal Affairs Committee, which would

then bring the matter to Council. There_

must be a majority of Council present to
move to impeach the member. At the hear-
ing, the Supreme Court Chief Justice
presides and the member must be found
guilty by a two-thirds vote of Council.
As part of the same set of amendments
to policy and bylaws, Council’s Student
Services Committee was expanded to en-
compass broader issues. The new commit-
tee is to be called the Student Community

on committee meeting absences

Committee.

The first issue the committee will face is
a resolution on a nuclear free zone for
SUNYA, which Council referred to the
committee Wednesday night.

In the nuclear free zone resolution.
Council's Student Action Committee call-
ed for the SUNYA administration to ban
from the SUNYA campus, all nuclear
power and weapons projects, “with the ex-
ception of those used for scientific pur-
poses and/or associated experiments."

The resolution was referred to the Stu-
dent Community Committee, because, ac-
cording to Feig, it should not have been
presented by the Student Action
Committee.

The new Student Community Commit-
tee, Feig said, was created to expand the
services that Council provides. The com-
mittee will now work on such issues as
minority concerns and off-campus student
problems. Feig said the committee will
“widen its scope to deal with tnost aspects
of student life that aren't covered by other
committees."

Central Council also voted down a pro-
posal to make tax sticker distributors at
Spring pre-registration salaried employees.

Tax stickers, affixed to the back of
SUNYA ID cards. are currently being
given out at the Student Association Con-
tact Office. Thcy serve as proof that a stu-
dent has paid the mandatory student ac»
tivity fee, and entitle students to discounts
on parties, movies and many campus
events.

Council member Steve Landis introduc-
ed the bill, for which $268.00 would have
been taken out of SA‘s Emergency Spen-
ding account, in order to pay students to
distribute the stickers.

Feig said he believes that SA wouldn‘t
have to spend the money for this, if every
Council member would spend one hour a
week distributing tax stickers during pre-
registration. This has been done in the
past.

The bill failed 8-11-0, so Council
members will again be distributing the tax
stickers themselves. [,Li

ministrators reluctantly go along with the
screenings, which are usually staged by
fraternities or campus ﬁlm societies.

“This situation,” ‘observed William
Fishback, an aide to Hereford at Virginia,
“is not a winner in any respect."

Fishback said Hereford ﬁnally decided
that “we're talking about an issue of
freedom here. We will not,.ban movies
because this could lead to book burnings
and such."

“This is a very complex issue of
values," NOW’s Taylor replied.
“Hereford claims the school won't do
anything that is against community stan-
dards, but in Charlottesville, this is against
community standards."

She maintained “the cost of human
dignity is too great to show this type of
film on public grounds of a state school,
espoecially as a fundraiser.” Taylor said

 

she sees the issue as “the last bastion of
men against women at a university.“

The courts, however,_have been quick to
rule against those who would ban movies,
books or other forms of popular culture.

In a May, I983 landmark case, a
Michigan federal judge forced Grand
Valley State College administrators to pay
the $250 rental fee for an X-rated film a
student group wanted to show.

Even student groups have shied away
from outright bannings. In the last six
months, student politicians at Penn,
Hawaii, Arizona State and even Virginia
rejected measures that would have barred
X-rated ﬁlms.

Hoping to steer a middle course, the
Cal-Santa Barbara student government in
1983 voted to allow showing pornographic
ﬁlms, but to require‘they be preceded by a
10-minute educational program on the
subject.

frustrate first year college students

Pittsburgh, PA
(COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE) Most
college freshmen are surprised,
confused and frustrated during
their ﬁrst year of computer
courses, according to a newly-
released study.

The computer anxiety afflicts
incoming students in all majors,
but may be particularly severe
among liberal arts majors,
observers add.

Over 80 percent of all incoming
freshmen are “surprised” by the
subject matter covered in com-
puter courses, the survey reveals.

Moreover, one of every two
freshmen are “confused” by
computer coursework, while
nearly 70 percent say the courses
actually make them “frustrated”
and “angry.”

“When freshmen go away to
college they have a lot of new ex-
periences. But the computer
science courses turn out to be
much different than any of the
new students expected," said Lee
Sproull, a researcher at Carnegie
Mellon University who has
surveyed CMU freshmen over the
last three years to assess their at-
titudes toward computer courses
there.

Among other things, Sproull
says entering students find com-
puter courses “more surprising,
more confusing and harder to get
a handle on” tltan their other
courses.

And such confusion over com-
puters “is true of liberal arts as

well as technical students," she
added.

One of the reasons for the so-
called computer anxiety, Sproull
said, is that students are often
“thrust into the computer
culture" before they learn how
computers work and understand
the special language used in com-
puter courses.

Unlike many schools, “com-
puting at CMU is not simply a
question of learning about com-
puters in a classroom setting.
Computing is a part of the whole
work'life at a campus,” Sproull
noted.

With more traditional subjects
like history, math, or physics, she
said, students learn in a sheltered,
academic environment, and ease
their way into the subjects as their
ability and understanding
Increases.

But the “hands-on" experience
in computer classes catapaults
students directly into the real-life
world of computing, frequently
without any prior exposure to the
subject or the machines.

Thus, “students who are new
to computing end up using the
campus mainframe right beside
advanced users, which often
makes the newcomers feel in-
timidated and even there confus-
ed," she said.

“That‘s a natural reaction for
just about anyone who has to use
computers in the presence of ex-
perienced users," agreed Mark
Tucker, director ofthe Project on

Information Technology and
Education in Washington, D.C.

“And the confusion and in-
timidation cycle repeats itself
each time you use a different
computer or a new piece of soft-

ware," he added, “which makes '

it a lot different from learning
other college subjects."

To ease students’ entry into the
:ampus computer culture, resear-
cher Sproull suggests colleges of-
fer computer orientation couses
so students will learn the basic
rules and lingo before taking a
computer course. ,

In addition, colleges need to
“make their terminal rooms less
aversive," she said.

“Many of the students we
surveyed said the computer rooms
reminded them of a scene out of
“1984’ because they were so cold
and sterile. Computer rooms
should be more warm and in-
viting," Sproull added.

Fortunately, the computer anx-
iety many freshmen experience
decreases as they become more
familiar with the subject, Sproull
noted.

“Some students become very
exhilarated by their new-found
knowledge and say ‘Wow, I never
knew this could be so fun."’

On the other hand, those who
never quite overcome the confu-
sion and frustration “end up do-
ing just enough to get by," while
still others give up on the subject
altogether, she said. [3

Nutritionist’s study reveals sharp
weight gain for college students

State College, PA
(COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE) If
you're a college freshman, arm
yourself for a four—year battle of
the bulge.

A just-released study of Penn
State students by nutritionist Jean
Harvey and two other researchers
reveals men gain an average of 9.!
pounds during their first year of
college. Women average a nine—
pound gain.

And the extra pounds sneak up
each year. Sophomores gain 7.3
pounds while juniors put on 7.8
pounds and seniors 6.5 pounds,
the study found.

Many students blame fattening
dorm food, but Harvey said the
study exonerates it.

“Residence (on or off campus)
wasn't a factor in weight
change,” she said. “So students’
claims that dorm cafeteria food
caused the gains aren't accurate,"
she added.

The questionaire, sent to 2400
Penn State undergraduates, drew
about 1000 responses to 36 ques-
tions about weight, eating and ex-
ercise. Results show 67 percent of

the men questioned and 62 per-
cent of the women admitted gain-
ing weight.

Only senior respondents lost
weight, apparently thanks to exer-
cise, Harvey said.

Emotional and psychological
factors, such as living away from
home, weren't surveyed, but
Harvey said he has “a feeling
people at Penn State are planning
a study to determine the influence
of these factors on student weight
gain."

No one knows if all students
ptit on pounds at the same clip
Penn State students do. ,

The American College Health
Association shows no record of
any national surveys similar to the
Penn State study, though a 1978
federal study determined college
students were an average of six
pounds heavier than the students
of I968.

Yet overweight students and
health and nutritional concerns
have prompted many colleges to
implement diet and exercise
programs.

NEWSWRITERS

Detroit bases weight control on
behavioral methods to improve
eating habits.

Many student health clinics
publish diet tips in campus
newspapers, especially dttring the
spring “get in shape" rush.

In 1982, Stanford developed a
dorm nutrition program, posting
nutritional information for
cafeteria food. It listed the
calorie, fat and cholesterol con-
tents of each item it sold.

A similar program exists at the
University of the Pacific in
Stockton, Calif.

Dietician Joan Nikirk called it
an “educational program, mostly
presented through posters and
pamphlets to make students
aware of basic food groups and
nutrition.”

But the program has done little
so far to change students' eating
habits, Nikirk admitted, although
a survey shows 80 percent of the
students are aware of it.

“There’s only so much you can
do in the dining halls," she said,
adding, “Maybe next year we'll
take a different approach."
