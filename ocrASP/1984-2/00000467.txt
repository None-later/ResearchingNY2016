Vandalism endangers-safety

Stevens said. stu ats have also
directed their viol ‘e to burning
posters on walls and throwing
beer bottles out of the towers.

.“Burning paper on the walls
seems to be the latest thing," said
Stevens, explaining that for some
reason this activity has increased
lately. ‘

“This is not your average col-
lege prank.” said Stevens. who is
concerned that recently students
have been endangering their own
lives by igniting the posters.

Colleen Gembccki. an RA in
Johnson Hall on Coloniathtad,
reported a beer bottle had been
thrown from the tower through a
skylight into her section last
Saturday.

“It came through the skylight
and bounced off a lounge chair,"
said Gembecki, noting that no
one was hurt in the incident.

Laura Wakefield, who was in
the lounge at approximately 7:30
pm. on Saturday. when the bot-
tle was thrown, said the beer bot-
tle came within several feet of hit-
ting her head.

“I was talking to someone and
it just came down a few feet
away,” said Wakefield, adding
that the bottle did not break when
it hit the floor.

“At first I thought someone
upstairs ‘had thrown it," said
Wakefield. “But then I saw the
hole in the skylight."

Phil Johnson, an RA in Morris
Hall onfColonial. reported that
his section has had fivefalse fire

alamrs so far this year.

“We haven't found out what

caused them yet,” said Johnson.
'who also reported four broken
windows and a smashed candy
machine in his section.

“The amount of damage is in-
creasing," stated Stevens. who
said that the damage often comes
after parties in the dormitories.

“A lot of trash is left behind at
these supposedly supervised par-
ties." maintained Stevens. The
mess, he said. is a potential fire
hazard.

Last weekend a stuffed lounge
chair was thrown out of the first
floor lounge in Waterbury Hall,
on Alumni Quad. said Stevens.

Scharl, however, does not
equate vandalism to lounges with
vandalism to fire safety equip-
ment. “Nobody's life is on the
line when a cltair is thrown out of
the ﬁrst floor lounge,” he said.

“I just wish students would
take their environment more
seriously.” said Scharl.

John Brancato, an RA on State
Quad, reported two false alarms,
a stolen fire extinguisher and a
broken window in his section.

“We’ve had a problem also
with smashed furniture,” said
Brancato, explaining that
students on the predominantly
frosh quad “don’t have a respect
yet for where they are living.” El

Mondale planned to start his
day in Milwaukee and -was
scheduled to appear before au-
diences later in Cleveland;
Toledo. Ohio; and Film. Mich.

A new ABC News-Washington
Post. poll said Reagan is still
leading Mondale by 12 percentage
points}, 54 percent to 42 percent,
the same margin as last week
before the second presidential
debate. -

A new Harris Survey showed
Reagan leading 56 percent to 42
percent. Last week, the margin in
the Harris Survey was 9 points.

Mondale pollster Peter D. Hart
said his polling results were
similar to the ABC-Post numbers.
He said what “amazes me is the
remarkable consistency in
Reagan’s numbers over the last

live months. Our challenge re-
mains to convert some of those
weak Reagan voters, and we have
less time."

Mondale campaigned in
farmland from before sunup to
sundown Wednesday. saying the
Reagan administration has
brought the worst of times to
agriculture.

“If rural America rises up and
throws Mr. Reagan out and elects
me. the message will be out:
Don‘t mess with these farmers.
They are dangerous. Don’t mess
with them,” Mondale said.

He also tried hard to repair the

damage he apparently has suf-.

fered from the 1980 grain em-
bargo imposed by President
Carter. whom Mondale served as
vice president.

Syracuse, N. Y.
(AP) There's an appropriate,
Halloween-like atmosphere of
mystery surrounding Saturday's
college football clash between Ar-
my and Syracuse.

The unreality starts with a com
parison of how the teams are do-
ing now after ore-season predic-
tions: Many publications figured
Syracuse to go 7-4 or 8-3 and land
in a respectable bowl; Street and
Smith’s annual Yearbook said
Jim Young's Army squad didn’t
look good enough to win more
than three or four games.

Syracuse is 3-4, has lost three
straight after stunning then-No.1

went out for the team last year. I
hadn't played tennis seriously for
a couple of years. He thought I
had potential and put a lot of illIIL‘
into me when he really didn't
have to, which helped me a lot.“

As for the season, Gerber said,
“We did exceptionally well. We
did a lot better than anyone
expected."

Eisenbcrg said. "I think the
best thing he did this season was
that he stressed the effort and not
the result. Not the winning or los-'
ing, but to go out there and do
your best and the winning will
come with the effort. It's a good
attitude to play with. In other
words, stressing the effort breeds
success."

The whole team is looking for-
ward to the spring. Eisenberg
said. “There was good harmony
between the team this season.
Hopefully it will continue in the
spring. I'd like to thank my team-
mates for a really good season."

“We had a great season," said
Dcrmansky. It was a lot of fun.
All the guys became good friends.
We went to the Lamp Post and
told the whole place when we won
the SUNYAC championship. We
are all looking forward to the spr—
ing because we are great bud-
dies.” [’1

And, says Syracuse Coach Dick
