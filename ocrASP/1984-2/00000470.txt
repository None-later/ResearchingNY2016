Italian wins marathon

New York
(AP) Little-known Orland Pizzoiato of
Italy overcame severe palm-which caused
him to stop eight times in the final five
miles--to win the New York City Marathon
Sunday.

It was an extremely gritty performance
by the 26-year-old Pizzoiato. whose time
of two hours, 14 minutes, 52 seconds was
the slowest since the race was moved from
Central Park to the city’s ﬁve boroughs in
1976.

 

There was no surprise in the women‘s
division as Norways' Gretc Waitz led all
the way to win the race for the third con-
secutive time and the sixth time in the past
seven years.

Waitz‘s unofficial time of 2:29:30 was
her slowest in New York since 1978. But
the 31-year-old forntcr school teacher
from Oslo was in command throughout.
leading by as much as 2 and one-half
minutes near the halfway point.

Representatives from the Democratic
and Republican presidential camps clashed
during a debate in the Campus Center
Monday night. but many students called it
a lackluster performance.

Assemblyman Michael Hoblock,
representing President Ronald Reagan.
and Former Congressman Ned Pattison
representing Walter Mondale, candidly
debated foreign policy. the economy Civil
Rights, and environmental issues .

The debate. sponsored by the Student
Association for. the State University,
SUNYA's Student Association and the
New York Public Interest Research
Group(NYPIRG), went “very well.” ac-
cording to NYPIRG debate coordinator
Debbie Eichorn.

“It gave students the opportunity to ask
last minute questions," concerning na-
tional issues. she said. "The Represen-
tatives gave the students a very good idea
of what each candidate stood for," she
added.

Many students present at the debate
disagreed.

Larry Miller, a sophomore at SUNYA,
felt Hoblock's representation of Reagan
was “wishy-washy." Ed Dougherty. also a

sophomore, said that both men were weak
on the issues.

When asked about Reagan's stand on
equal rights for women, Hoblock replied
"Oh, I think there's a hand-out on that."

ministration’s failure to endorse the Equal

spirit and enthusiasm to the American
people.

“In short," said Hoblock. “we are far
better off'now than in i980. That's what
counts." ,

Pattison. meanwhile, referred to the
President as “The Babe Ruth" of Federal

On the issue of prayer in schools, the Reagan
representative stated that Reagan advocates
“voluntary meditation in schools. It is not a

mandatory government imposition but an
option.”

 

Right's Amendment, Hoblock declared
that he “agreed with that position."
Regarding the economy. Pattison
declared that at present, “the economy
looks a whole lot better than it is."
Hoblock. meanwhile. stressed that the
Reagan administration brought down in-
ﬂation and “changed the country."

Making an appeal to the student's
“sense of patriotism. Hoblock maintained
that the President has given a new sense of

spending. "He has not slowed the rate of
spending, nor has he submitted a balanced
budget" Pattison charged.

Hoblock rcbutted. saying Reagan had
cut inﬂation by two-thirds and "curbed
the Recession “which he said plagued
Americans during the Carter Administra-
tion.” “I'm sorry," maintained Pat-
tison, "but this big spender administration
just_won't prove out."

When one student charged that the

Reagan administration has been
“misleading the American Public" in
regard to nuclear weaponry. aHoblock
responded that “Americans will" be suc-
cessfully defended "in the event of a

- nuclear conflict."

On the issue of prayer in‘schools.
Hoblock stressed that the Reagan ad-
ministration advocates “voluntary medita-
tion in schools. It is not a mandatory
government imposition, but an option."
he said.

When asked about Financial Aid to
students, Hoblock maintained increased
funds for student loans; and increased Pell
grants from “.800 to $3,000 each.

Pattison meanwhile, adamantly rebut-
ted. saying that “the Reagan administra-
tion gave up on Pell grants a long time
ago."

Many students present at the debate said
they felt Hoblock dodged the issues.

“The Mondale Representative (Pat-
tison) definitely won," said sophomore
Michael Berman. “The Reagan represen-
tative (Holblock) did not have a clear
understanding of the issues."

' Rob Segall. a freshman, said he believes
Pattison was “more honest" to the
audience. [3

Minority affairs office gets mostly good reviews

By Phillip Chonigman

SUNYA’s Student Association Minority
Affairs office is receiving mostly good
reviews as it enters its second year of pro-
tnoting tninority activities at SUNYA, but
at least one group leader said he has not
been contacted by the office, and he is not
sure what the office does.

According to Eric Bowman, this year’s
Minority Affairs coordinator. his office
“coordinates the activities between all the
minority groups on campus." The position
of Minority Affairs Coordinator was
created two years ago by Student Associa-
tion, and includes a stipend of $l.500.

Nearly 25 groups are represented by the

office, Bowman said. bttt “some don’t
(make use of the office) because they do
not feel like minorities." He cited the Ger-
man Club and the Irish Club as examples.

One group leader who has apparently
not been reached by the minority affairs
office is Woo Sottg, President of the
Korean Students Association. "I do not
really know what the Minority Affairs of-
ficc does." he asserted. explaining that he
has not yet been contacted by the Office
since he took over as President of his
group in early September.

According to Bowman. tltcrc have been
no mailings or newsletters sent out to all
the groups. “We are trying to work with

Even though she resigned last year as
President Reagan's Environmental Pro-
tection Agency Director, the heat’s not
off for Anne Burford. When she ap-
pears at SUNYA Tuesday night she will
be greeted by demonstrators waving
signs and passing out leaflets.

Members of SUNYA’s New York
Public Interest Research Group chapter
will be protesting Burford's appearance.
According to Dean Perchman. a
NYPIRG member. NYPIRG will be
handing out pamphlets and fact sheets
intended to make people aware of some
of the issues and' events that occurred
while she was in office and her record on
those issues.

NYPIRG members will also be carry-
ing signs and marching in front of the
Campus Center. “It will be sort of like
an old fashioned demonstration with
signs and protestors interacting with the
crowd," he said. The protests are plann-
ed for 7 p.m.. an hour before Burford's
appearance. he added.

Burford resigned as head of the EPA
In March 1983 in the face of several im-
pending indictments for refusing to
reveal files containing information
about toxic waste dumps. possible viola-
tions of EPA regulations. and accusa-
tions that her employees and advisors
wcrc affiliated with tltc corporations in-
volved in toxic waste litigation.

NYPIRG expects “at least 20 to 40
demonstrators." Reichman said. adding
“the more the merrier."

Speakers Forum agreed this summer
to bring Burford to campus when her
agent notified them she would be
available. According to Speakers Forum
Chair Ricky Feldman. "she's controver-
sial. she's current. and I think she‘s a
great speaker."

Fcldman said he expects upwards of
100 people to tlllctld and that about 25
people have already purchased tickets.

bringing Burford to SUNYA, saying “I
‘on't think that really matters." He also

said. ‘

Gay and Lesbian Alliance co-chair Ellen
Dunnigan said. "From what I understand.
we haven't yet worked with the Minority
Affairs Office.“ But, she said, “they have
approached us and it was a positive
encounter."

Artemis Artctniou'. of the International
Students Association(lSA). said that no
onc'from theVMi'r‘tor‘iiy‘Afl'airs office was
able to make it to a ntccting of ISA leaders
in which they discussed plans for a
November l7th international dinner.
However. Artemiou said, “Eric (Bowman)
has been very helpful." He added that
Bowman has indicated that he wants to be
kept informed ofall of the ISA‘s activities.

Bowman asserted. “We are trying to
develop (better) communications between
the minority groups and Central Couttcil.
and to recruit minority students for work
in SA." He added. “We are responsible
for all the minority groups on campus."

The Minority Affairs Office maintains a
calendar ofcvcnts to avoid any conflicts of
scheduled activities amottg thc minority
groups.

“The Minority Affairs Office has
organized many activitics bctwccn tts and

Bryan noted. "

Bryan prttiscd the Office of Minority
Affairs for successfully organizing cultural
activities on campus. “They've also been
good at keeping in touch with minority
groups on other campuses." which also
aids in planning future events, she said.

In addition to coordination activities,
the Minority Affairs Office sometimes c‘ci-
sponsors activities with both student and
University groups. Currently. Bowman
said he is working with the admissions of-
fice to “build up the Minority Recruitment
Task Force.“ which works to incrcase the
number of minority studcuts enrolled at
SUNYA.

SUNYA students are presently being
trained in admissions policy. recruitment

techniques, and the filling out of financial

aid applications. so that they can go to the
high schools as representatives of the
University. said Bowman. The Task Force
he said. will “deal with New York City
schools first, during the winter break."
Attothcr project the Mittority Affairs
Office is working on is the South African
Divestment and Anti-apartheid Mini-
Confcrcnce. tentatively scheduled for the
second week of November. Tltc conference
is being held itt conjuction with the Univer.
sity's African-Afro-American Depart-

ment. and the American-South African
Peoples Friendship Association.

Bowman said that the conference “falls
under minority affairs because it directly
affects black and international studentsou
this campus."
