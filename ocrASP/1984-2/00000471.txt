1 Washington. D.C.
(AP) President Reagan is sitting on an
enormous lead over Walter Mondale
slightly more than a week before Election
Day .1984, a nationwide Associated Press
survey says, but Democrats are reminding
voters. 1"th ain’t over until it's over."

The turns of events have
left Reagan ahead in 40 states 'with 426

“i think there is movement toward

said New Hampshire Democratic chair-
-man George Bruno.

“We benefitted from the surge between
the first and second debates and rallied
most of the Democrats. but there is no
movement now," said Colorado party,
chairman Floyd Ciruli.

Reagan currently enjoys a big cushion in
putting together the margin needed to win
a second term. he draws i70 electoral votes
from states that are solidly in the GOP‘s
corner. The Republican incumbent gets
256 more from states where he is leading,
but by smaller margins.

Mondale is ahead only in his ltome state
of Minnesota. with l0 electoral votes. and
in the District ol‘ Columbia, which awards
only three of the 538 electoral votes at
stake on Nov. 6.

electorate, the support of organized labor

cians and poll-takers. -

Mondale made an appearance MOHday
in New York City at the annual dinner or
the state liberal party. which has given
him its presidential endorsement.

“i know that you are going to make the
difference for me in New York," Mondale
told the Liberals. The vote on the miner
party's ballet line helped carry New Yurk
for Franklin Roosevelt in l944 and for
John Kennedy in I960.

Four years ago the Liberal Party endors.
ed John Anderson, and he captured 8 per.
cent of the vote-~enough to weaken then.
President Jimmy Carter and allow Reagan
to carry New York with 47 percent of the
vote. Anderson has campaigned for Mon.
dale in the state this year.

The city's three largest newspaper split
two-to-one in favor of President Reagan in
this electon year, as The New York Times
and the Daily News weighed in Sunday
with their endorsements. The Times en-
dorsed Walter Mondale; the News backed
Reagan, who had previously been endors-
ed by the New York Post.

Three upstae New York newspapers-the
Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. lltc
Sunday Albany Times-Union. and the
Elmira Star Gazette-in Sunday editions
endorsed Republican President Rmmtd
Reagan for re-election.

The Sunday Albany Titties-Union's
editorial endorsing Reagan said of the
president, “He has touched the American
spirit, moved it and helped America find
itself again."

The newspaper said that although
Reagan had made mistakes during his first
term, the president’s policies had pro-
mpted “a good change in direction for
America. and we should maintain that
course."

Richard J. Connors ‘

By James O'Sulllvan
ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR

Albany's Democratic State
Assembly candidate Richard J.

Conners. the incumbent, is a'

believer in "local option," mean-
ing that the separate powers of
federal. state, and local govern-
ments must be kept distinct. and
it’s a philosophy he adheres to
both in a conversation and in
voting on state bills.

For example. although Conners
voted as early as l980 to allow
students to vote in their college
communities, he said he would
oppose a state bill mandating on-
campus polling places for
students because that is a “local
perogative."

"it wouldn't be constitutional-
ly my business," he said in an in-
terview Thursday morning in the
main studio of SUNYA's radio
station 9lFM-WCDB.

“Circumstances on this campus
might be entirely different (from)
circumstances in Hudson Valley,
Brockport. Stony Brook,
wherever," Conners said.

"You can't talk on one hand
about local home rule and on the
other hand ask somebody in a dif-
ferent branch of that government
to interpose their alleged in-
ﬂuence," he explained.

He said he has supported
students’ rights to vote in their
college communities because,
"when you become is years of
age, in tnost respects — and i
think it should be all — you are
entitled as an individual to vote."

Conners also voted against rais-
ing the legal drinking age in New
York from l9 to 2i because com-
ing only a year after the drinking
— or purchasing age as he
clarified it —— was raised from 18
to l9.f‘it was a second mandate in
too short a time."

“i'm not in favor of drunk
driving.” he stated. “and l've
voted against it many. many
times."

“My objection (to 2]) is that
we're picking on a group at a time
when the people, had they
wanted, mightjust as well made it
25 because the same statistics we

opposes raising the drinking age
to 2]. but is willing to accept at
SUNY tuition hike.

He said. during a phone inter-
view Friday. that drunk driving
laws need stiffer penalties com-
bined with stricter cn forcetnent.

The rising costs of a college
education, he said. should not be
absorbed by escalating state sup-
port for SUNY. bttt should be
combatted by increasing federal
financial aid for students. This.

Explaining his stance on drunk
driving laws. Silvcrstcin asserted.
"l8-19 your olds arrested for
DWi should nutomuticttlly have
their licenses revoked, without
any conditions or plea bargain-
ing." he said. noting a statistical-
ly demonstrated high accident
rate among drivers in thc l8-2l
age group.

Silverstein, a graduate of
Russell Sage with a Masters
degree in Public Administration.
said he is strongly opposed to
repenlling the mandatory scat belt
law signed by New York State
Governor Mario Cuomo this
summer. ‘

The discomfort of a seat belt
is slight when you compare to the
injuries or ‘deaths caused by ac-
cidents." said Silverstein. He
noted that accidents can also
become costly lo‘cilizctts through
the higher taxcs and insurance
premiums that must be paid when
a state has :1 high accident rate.

Silverstein, who compares the
role of government to that of a
business which needs to work cl‘fi-
cicntlyundicompctiliveiy to pro-
vide services for constituents, said
he docs not feel that the scans belt
legislation or DWi laws are intru-
sions into private mnttcrs. He
said, “This is a good low. and one
which will save lives."

Conners avoided confronting
the issue of SUNY tuition hikes
saying that tuition increases
should be considered “cost
hikes." and maintained that
“Costs constantly grow irrespec-
tivcly (of) what people say that
the costs or the inﬂationary rate
or anything is."

‘But he said he does not support
SUNY tuition increases unless the
state government cannot fill gaps
in the SUNY budget. “No one
was more constant ill their sup-
port than the legislators represen-
ting the campuscs of the four
universities." he added.

Conners mentioned that he
recently received a SUNY
Distinguished Service Award.

Promising, "l'll do everything
i can (to hold down tuition ex-
penses)," he added, "You don't
think i got the SUNY award a
couple of weeks ago because i
haven't been a supporter of
higher education?"

The incumbent said he would

move by SUNY to allow some
schools, including Albany, to
move to Divison i sports. A re-

Come meet the candidates this Thursday at 7:30

'By Leslie Chalt
STAI'I WRITER

As the nation gcurs up for election day.
SUNYA students will be able to get a
closer look at prospective members of
Congress, state senators. assembly
members and judges when l0 local con-
didatcs converge on campus for "Meet the
Candidates Night," Thursday. November
l, at 7:30pm in Lecture Center 1.

Contenders for national. state and local
offices will address "student issttes," such
as tuition hikes. financial aid, the Equal
Rights Amendment. and the possibility of
a 21 drinking age, according to event
organizer Gregg Rothschild.

The forum will begin with opening
statements from the Candidates. followed
by prepared questions from a panel of stu-
dent leaders. The evening will culminate
with members of the audience posing ques-
tions for the candidates.

According [0 Steve Gawley, Chuir'of
Central Council’s Student Action Com-
mittee. which is co-sponsoring the event
with the Student Association of the State
University (SASU). the purpose of Meet
the Candidates Night is “to procure an

didatcs respect. and this is evident by their
willingness to speak on campus."

SASU delegate Nathaniel Charncy said,
“it is very important to go to candidates
night and to vote. lfyou don‘t know who
to vote for. go to candidates night. it will

he very informative and will aid in making
a decision as to who to vote for."

“Most of the candidates." Charncy
said. “felt we (students) are irrelevant, bttt
some feel we are important.“

According to Rothschild. if students
tttrn out and vote. the candidates will be
forced to listen to students and respect
them.

Candidtcs night, Gawiey said, is "going
to add so much credibility to us (students).
We want the leaders to know why we are
going to vote. We want to leave an impres-
sion in the candidate's mind that the 'why'
is because we know the issues." Gawlcy
said.

Rothschild stressed the importance of
knowing the candidates' views. so
educated votes can be made on Election
Day.

State Senate opponents Howard Nolan.
the democratic incumbent. and Joseph
Frangclla. a republican. will face off on
SUNY tuition increases. TAP financial
aid, and 21 drinking age proposals, as well
as othcr statc wide issues.

Republican congressional candidate
lirnnk Wickes will discuss national issues.

DcmOcrntic incumbent Richard Conners

and Republican challenger Paul Silverstein
will compete for votes to represent District
l04 in the State Assembly, while Democrat
Robcrt Van Slyke will attempt to draw stu-
dent votes in his race for the State
Assembly in District l03.

‘ Democrat John Turner and Republican
Steven Gates will campaign for County
Court Judgeship, while Democrat Tony
Cardonrt and Republican Dennis lrwin will
compete for the Family Court slot.

Ross Abeiow, a United States Student
Association (USSA) delegate. said, "This
year's candidates night is going to be much
better. This year is the year to be a student
activist and to get involved."

Gawiey said if the turnout is good and
Candidates Night is successful, it will lend
credibility to the student vote, which this
year includes almost 6.000 newly registered
SUNYA students.

As far as how the candidates feel about
the students' rights to vote in their college
commttnities, which is currently a hotly
debuted issue. anley asserted that a large
student voter turnout might sway can-
didates toward supporting students on this
issue. Cl
