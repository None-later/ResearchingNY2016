By Tom Gaveglla

Students will be asked to pr0<
test a possible SUNY tuition hike
by wearing a blue ribbon one day
next February if Governor Mario
Cuomo or the state legislature
calls for a tuition increase.

The ribbons are part of a cam-
paign being run by the New York
Pttblic lntcrcst Research Group
(NYPlRG). The group kicked off
the catnpaign at the end of its Fall
Conference in New York City.

The conference was attended
by 250 people frotn 18 colleges in-
cltiding SUNYA. The students at-
tctiding were members of their
local NYPlRG chapters.

As part ot'NYPlRG‘s effortsto
prevent a tuition hike, students
will be asked to sign pledge cards
which are to be presented to
Cuomo at a press conference ear-
ly next year. Cuomo will be asked
at that time to promise not to
raise tuition, explained
NYPlRG's Vice-Chair for

Organizing Ross DcMarco.

Almost every year the state
legislature threatens to pass or
passes a tuition hike of $200 or
more. said DeMarco. This year.
she said, NYPlRG‘s new cam-
paign against tuition hikes starts
off on the offensive.

According to DeMarco. if this
action fails to stop any proposed
hike then NYPlRG will be offer-
ing solutions to solving higher
education problems, including a
more progressive income tax and
climinations of tax loopholes for
corporations.

“it's not fair that higher educa-
tion is suffering from the rich.

. who are not paying their fair

share," DcMarco said.

Tltc theme of the conference
was "Getting Out the Student
Vote,“ chosen because of
NYPlRG‘s highly successful
voter registration drives

Karen McMahon, chair of
NYl’lRG‘s State Board of Direc-
tors. said that the first step in
NYPlRG‘s voter participation
project was registration, the se-

Keynote speaker Mark Greene.

an activist for several years. lash-
ed out at the Reagan administra-
tion when addressing the
conference.

“i think Mondale and Ferraro
have been very capable in the last
month of defining and cxposittg
the dog-hydrant relationship this
(Reagan) administration has had
with the poor, blacks. and
others." Greene said.

Green also discussed the na—
tional debates, saying that
“George Bush's press secretary
said ‘You can say anything you
want in adcbate before 80 million
people.’ When asked about
George Bush's iiiistatements that
caught up with him, he said ‘So
what, perhaps 200 people, maybe
20,000 will hear the correction.
but not 80 million.’~Tliat was the
most contemptuous statement 1
ever heard."

Green praised NYPlRG for its
voter participation efforts. saying
“The American public can’t
aford not to get involved in
1984.” .

He also said he believes Mon-
dale can win by getting the ma-
jority of electoral votes from the
large states.

New York City Council
member Ruth Messenger discuss-
ed issues that face New York City
in 1985, the year of the next
Mayoral election.

She said she is a strong oppo-
nent of Mayor Ed Koch because,
she said. he believes that govern-
ment should help only those who
can help themselves. “We have to
worry about the gross failure of
the city to pick up the pieces of
the- social programs that the
federal government doesn't
cover," she said.

tion to make New York City a
