(all classifieds are taken
in the contact office
in the campus center)

By John Crawford ,

It is gratifying to see the
reasonable audacity of the
Masters in‘ Social Welfare
students (MSW) They are not
satisfied with the School ofSocial
Welfarc‘s (SSW) respons‘c to the
missing credit in the School's cur-
riculum. A

credit that 

prevents many
students from Graduate
reaching the re-

quired 60 to Advocate
graduate.

SSW faculty administrators say
the credit is in the permutations
of the MSW curriculum. MSW
students say it is lost through an
SSW error. SSW failed to make
a 2 credit course a 3 credit course
for the Fall of 84. The School
made it for the Fall of 85. Now
MSW students are coming to

the end of their course sequence

with only 59 credits instead of
the 60 needed to graduate.

MSW students are organizing
to get their one credit. They are
using academic channels to do .
so. But they want to expedite the
process. Unfortunately the SSW
faculty administrators have never
heard 'of such a thing.

At a well attended meeting on
October 17. the faculty ad-
ministrators had lots ofsympathy
but no active support to- ex-
peditiously correct the problem.
One could not help remembering
that old organizing refrain: if
you're not part of the solu-
tion.you'rc part of the problem.
This writer kept thinking of how
mediocrity with effort is far
superior to do-nothingism.

Let’s hope the MSW student‘s
enthusiasm for correcting pro-

I GSEU Workplace survey

The Albany members of the
Graduate Student Employees
Union are about to conduct a
survey on the Albany campus.
The survey has two purposes: to
gather‘ workplace data from
graduate student employees
(TA/GA/RA'S). and to distribute
that information to its members
and the administration.

First.-the union wants to gather
together those issues and concerns
that it knows TA/GA/RA'S are
most troubled about. Also. the
GSEU plans to ask what other
concerns its members want the
union to address. Then the GSEU
will gather a consensus on which
items should have priority for the
Albany campus.

The second purpose of the

survey is to provide a vehicle for-
GSEU members to gather théir‘

opinions and have them presented
to the appropriate campus ad-
ministrators. More importantly.
this data will be used at the
GSEU’s collective bargaining
V meetings with the state.
The ‘workpiace' survey will be
a one page series of questions
with a checkoff scale of impor-
tance for each issue. For example:
How concerned are you about
receiving a higher salary. 0 equals
not applicable; I equals not con-
cerned; 2 equals somewhat con-
cerned; 3 equals very concerned; 4
equals extremely concerned.
Other examples are: increased
campus lighting and safety. credit
union for GA/TA/RA'S, affor-
dable on-campus housing for
married graduate students. in-
creased day care facilities. im-

proved laborstory safety. ,
Many of the survey questions
can be answered by all SUNYA
graduate students. The GSEU‘will
make it available to all'graduate
students in order that'lthc 4000
unheard and unrepresented
graduate students on campus will
have a chance to express
themselves on campus affairs.
The Albany workplace survey
is adapted from a similar one used
by the Graduate Student
Employees Union chapter at
Stony Brook. Our survey is the
product of volunteer work by
GSEU members on the Albany
campus. The union hopes to .have
it available in a few weeks: -: ‘
Those who-would like to work
on the survey — or who-have
issues they want on the survey —
