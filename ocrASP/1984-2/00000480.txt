The University's old traffic safety patrol
cars don‘t just die, they‘re auctioned off
by the state‘s Office ol' General Services
(005).

SUNYA's old cars. which had about
l30,000 miles on each one, were replaced
by three 1984 Dodge K-ears this past

YS 9  August. according to Captain Thomas
p Graham ofSUNYA's Public Safety squad.

Graham said the new vehicles are of-
ficially owned by 008 and were purchased

from Albany Dodge. the lowest bidder on
  K the state cotttract for the cars. Although.

he said he didn't know Itow ttutch OGS

 

spent on each car. he asserted tltat the state
had spent "more titan the car is worth.“ to
public safety, because, he said. the cars

cannot stand up to lie rigorotts treatment

 

“t that public safety officers demand.
An ()GS spokesperson said the state

  paid $8,200 per car. Since August the cars

have accutnttlatcd more than 7,000 miles

per day.
Eaclt vehicle is inspected at the end ot'

httsiness with the alleged apartheid regime
in Southg Africa. He said he would sup-
port a declaration that SUNY dives. all its
holding itt South Africa. as well. “I wottld

explained.

were also asked to rattk the candidates in
terms ot' leadership ability. domestic policy
and foreign policy.

On leadership 46 percent said Reagan
had utore ability and 37 percent leatted
toward Mondale.

The cars are equipped with a "police package. "

Public Safety gets new cars
but finds they’

re inadequate

oi' \chieles with 70,000 tniies or tuore are

' settt to 005. New vehicles are received

anywhere from six tttotttlts to one year
afterward, budget allowing, said (iraham.

The K-cars are equipped with a “police
package," Graham said. This includes
heavy duty brakes. a specially bttilt reat'
end and special from ettd braces. The ears‘
front ends last approximately 5.000 tniles
and are often ttnaligned because of speed
bumps attd curbs, said Graham.

The Dodge K-cars catt't be bought as
police vehicles anymore, Graham said. ex-
plaining that the cars don’t hold up well
over curbs and speed btttnps. In an
etnrgettcy situation officers can't worry
about what they‘re driving over. he said.

New equipment had to be bought to

maintain the new cars' front ends. Graham
said. - »
The colors were assigned by the state
government. Light brown with a dark
stripe are now the official public safety
colors.

Cars received in August I983 Itave ap-
proximately 55,000 miles each.

New cars are randomly assigned to all
police officers. 1 ‘

that missiles can be recalled to be in charge
of ottr national defense?"

“Vote as ifyour future depended on it,"
said Mondale. “because it does. It’s your
choice, yottr country and your future."

After the rally, Mondale said she found
the size of the crowd encouraging. “We
don't have the money to bombard the
public with mail." she said. "so we've got
to cotne ourselves. We've been finding en-
thusiasm where ever we go," she noted.

Mark Eagle. a SUNYA graduate student
working on the Mondale campaign. said.
"New York is pretty ntttch decided for him
already. He can‘t ignore the area, so they
brottght his wife." ;
