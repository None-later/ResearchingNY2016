Gainesville. FL
(COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE)
University of Florida students
soon zmay'find their indoor noc-
turnal activities curtailed by a ban
on members of the opposite sex
spending the night with them in
residence halls and fraternity
houses. ,. U '

And if Florida and othercol-
leges are any indication. students
everywhere may soon be facing
tough new restricitons on what
theyean do in campus housing.
Florida decided to think seriously
about‘ joining the growing
number of colleges that restrict
visiting hours when a university
task force suggested the changes
in July. ' '

Student reaction was mixed.

The iii-member task force.
made up of faculty. students, and
community representatives. was
reacting to an alleged rape at a
fraternity house and a campus
hearing into a student's complaint
about being disturbed by late-
night visitors. said Hugh Cunn-
ingham. director of university
information.

Currently. overnight visitation
is not permitted," Cunningham
noted. ‘thn 24-hour visitation is,

nqwummumzmr

r r) x y

  

 

 

         

 

   

so obviously overnight visitation
probably exists."

Among the suggestions were in-
house monitoring‘by students and
staff of individual residence halls.
and live-in adult supervision in
fraternity houses.

Most fraternity members

reacted "very well" to the reeom-‘
reported Tom‘

mendations.
Dougan. campus fraternity ad-
visor. though many feel they have
been singled ottt because of the
alleged rape this spring.

“In the coming year we'll start
staffing the fraternities with grad
students or house mothers."
Dougan said. “But most fraterni-
,ty membrs don't feel the presence
of a house mother would have
prevented what allegedly
occurred."

Last week. a 16~year-old girl
visiting UF claimed she was raped
at a pre-rush party at Sigma
Alpha Epsilon. which does not
have a resident adult supervisor.

UF police are still investigating
the incident.

Some fraternity members also
say they can‘t afford the $15,000
a year to hire a house mother.

Student reaction to the sugges-

tions was minimal because of the
.summer release of the task force’s

report. but Cunningham expects,

more feedback as students return
to campus this fall.

Florida is one of a number of
colleges that have changed over-
night visitors policies recently.
While sign in/sign out sheets and
curfews are outdated. resricted

guest hours are replacing the.

more liberal policies promoted in
the sixties and seventies on many
campuses.

ln i980. the University of Pitt-
sburgh revised its 24-hour visita-
tion policy and now restricts over-
nights gtlests to the} same sex. -
Kent State, Kansas. and
Alabama. among others. soon
followed suit.

The changes at'Pitt and Kent
State were prompted by dor-
mitory murders.

Administrators there and at
other schools cite security as the
reason for the changes.

Students themselves are the
ones asking for the stricter hous-
ing policies claimed Paul Jahr.
research committee chairman of
the American Association of Col-
lege and University Housing

OfﬁcersiACUHO).

“The nature'of college students
in general is changing.” he ex-2
plained. “They are makingan
economic decision to go to allege
and they want to make t e best
use of their time."

Dorm visiting policies were a
question “way back when," .lahr
added, but as society has changed
in the past two decades. so have
students. ~ '

“Most students now were born
after Kennedy was assasinated."
he said. “They've grown up in a
more permissive society and the
questiOn of vistitation hours just
isn't that big an issue to them."

Some students. however. are
unhappy with college ad-
ministrators' attempts to regulate
visiting hours regardless of securi-
ty or social reasons.

Western Illinois University stu-
dent Pat Botterman and exv
student Craig Roberts are suing

'WlU over its attempts to end a
14-year open-door policy.

WIU wants to ban co-ed visits
after midnight on weeknights and
after 2 a.m. on weekends. with
the curfew ending at 8 a.m. V

Botterman claims the change
violates the student constitution,

approved by the university’s
Board of Governors. Which
specifies that students will be con-
sulted in every level of
policymaking.

“The administration brought
out the policy with no debate,"
he said. “The students protested.
The current policy has been in ef-

‘fect since about 1969 and dorm

residents vote by ﬂoor on visita-

. tion hours."

Botterman and Roberts actual-
ly will file two suits. One. alleg-

'ing violation of the sudent con-

stitution. may be settled by the
university’s Board of Governors
in September, Botterman hopes.
The other. protesting the propos—
ed policy changes. will probably
require court settlement.

Visitation rules also have been
challenged at Alcorn_ State
University in Lorman, Mississip-
pi. A female student sued the
university for extending her one-
semester suspension to two for
violating the policy.

‘The student claims the college’

has conflicting policies for
punishing violaters. An Alcorn
State spokesman refused for com-
ment on the lawsuit. [1

(AP) Brockport State‘s football drought
of 24 games without a victory came to
an end on Saturday. and ﬂowing cham-
pagne marked the conclusion of the
Golden Eagles' winless skein.

“Defensive line. thank ‘.youl.?’.said
Brockport's second-year coach Keith
Moody. as he raised a glass of the
bubbly.

"How about those special teams!
Special teams. thank you," Moody said.

“Linebackers. thank youl,” he
shouted following Brockpo‘rt's 20-7 vic-
tory over the University of Rochester. I

Four years ago. Moody. who began
his career with the National Football
League's Buffalo Bills. basked in suc-
cess as the Oakland Raiders captured
the I980 championship. After a brief
stint with the New Jersey Generals of
the United States Football League.
Moody accepted the challenge of mak-
ing a winner of Brockport State.

something to savor with Saturday’s wi‘n.
“I've waited two years for this day."
Moody 'said. “This is the second
greatest feeling in my life. the ﬁrst being
winning the Super Bowl.
“For us. we've had a lot of heart-
breaks this year," he said. “We've been
‘down and- out. We've been stepped'on
and abused. Other coaches downgraded
us. They tried to embarass us by running
up the score. But the team had Strength
of character that showed it can live
through the adversity."

Defensive tackle Art Benson. who en-
joyed Brockport's last win —- a 29-26
squeaker against Buffalo State in the se-
cond game of the I982 season -— hopes
the ﬁrst win will open a victory
floodgate for the l-7 Golden Eagles.

“It's like a LOGO-pound rock off our
shoulders." he said. “When you‘re los-
ing. it‘s hard to crack that first win.
Now that we have. i don't see anything
in the way right now." V
