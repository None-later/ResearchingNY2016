200 SUN YA Mondale fans rally to’sh’aWLg‘uppOﬁ 

‘By llene Welnsteln

STAFF WRITER

About 200 SUNYA students shouting
anti-Reagan slogans and waving red. white
and blue signs, rallied on the podium Tues-
day to demonstrate their support for the
MondaleFerraro presidential campaign. ‘

The rally. sponsored by the SUNYA
chapter ofStudents for Mondale. was part
of a demonstration on 15 college campuses
statewide.

The rally has made campus supporters
of Democratic candidate Walter Mondale
“more vocal now," said Eileen Kieffe. co-
cltair of Students for Mondale. Kieffe add-
ed that there is a good deal of Mondale
support at SUNYA and the rally may have
brought others I‘ovcr to the Mondale
camp."

The rally will have a big impact at
SUNYA, agreed co-chair Theresa Settft.
Settft said she felt that as students go back
to the dorms with their Mondale buttons
and stickers they can sway the support of
tltcir friends who didn’t go to the rally.

“This campus is traditionally conscr-
vativc." explained Scnft. “We put on
more of a show than anybody expected us
to hccausc of our reputation of being
tlptltlictic." she addcd.

"I don‘t buy tltc myth that young people
are voting for Ronald Reagan,” dcclarcd
Maura Moynihmt. daugittcr of New York
Senator Patrick Moynihan. and a speaker
at the rally.

According to Moynihan, about 30 per-
ccnt of l8-25 ycar-olds population is
registered. Shc urged the Democratic Party

to register more young people for future
elections. As for this election. Moynihan
said. “if the Democrats can get 'the stu-
dent vote' we could really see a change in
this country."

Moynihan urged Democrats to convert
Reagan supporters, saying, “the facts are
on our side." Reagan is not helping the
economy. said Moynihan, who added that
thcsurplus of gas is causing our economic
recovery. “if OPEC raised their prices.
Reagan would suffer," she said. '

Regarding the presidential campaign,
Moynihan said the question is supporters

vs'. money. “The Democrats have man-
power. but not money, and that's a pro-
blem." she said, adding that she feels the
MondaleFerraro campaign is going well
despite this. '

Bill Cunningham. Upstate Coordinator
for the. democratic campaign. told the
railiers, “over the next six days we've got
to get as many people working and talking
for the MondaleFerraro campaign as
possible. if we do out job right here in
New York. we could really make a dif-
ference in the election."

never talk about what they've done to the
elderly and to the students. But. he eon-
tinued. “with Reagan’s recovery, the big
jobs in the next ten years [will be janitors,
receptionists. and secretaries." ﬂ

To rally the support. of their peers,
members of the SUNYA chapter of
Students for Mondale asked SUNYA pro-
fessors- to speak at the demonstration.
Political Science professor Bruce Mirot‘f
and History professor Lawrence Hoff-
man, were both on hand.

“Students have a lot of respect for the
professors who spoke today." said Keiffe.

"When respected professors lay their
beliefs on the line. people listen." agreed
Scnft. who added that student reaction to
the speakers was very spirited.

“if people listen to the issues. then they
have to vote against Ronald Reagan." said
SUNYA student Eric Weistman. “We'Vc
got to get Democrats out to vote." he said.
adding that while titerc are more registered
Democratics titan Republicans, Democrats
don’t vote.

“Mondale has a good citancc of winn-
ing," said Catina Mavodoncs. another
SUNYA student. She added that a large
majority of people are independent or
undecided.

Mavodones said that while she feels
students on campus support Mondale. it‘s
a quiet kind of support.

“A lot of students are still informed."
said studcnt Wendy Ccrv'i. who expressed
disappointment with thc turnout. “if
women and students came out to vote,
Mondale would win.“ she said. l3

  

 

Whalen calls on SUNY officials in housing dilemma

By Allcla Clmbora
Iii)! I'URlAl. ASSIS l ANI‘

Blaming the city’s housing pro-
blcttt on over enrollment by the
University attd “mscrupulous”
landlords "packing" students in-
to their buildings, Albany Mayor
Thomas Whalen called on the
SUNYA administration to work
with tltc city in finding a solution
to the housing dilcntna.

"it's not tltc city‘s problem
alone, it's the University's pro-
blem as well," said Mayor
Whalen at a prcss conference
Tuesday night.

Wltalett also discussed other
student issues including student
voting rigltts arid the possibility of
an abortion clinic on Lark Street.

Many of the housing problems
facing the city and students this
year have stentntcd from a city
zoning ordinance known as tltc
grouper law. that until recently

dinancc states that no ntorc than
titrcc tmrclatcd pcoplc may reside
in a rental llllll at one time.

Albany’s Code Enforcement
Bureau is currently in the process
of visiting studcnt rcsidencs to
“get a handle on the magnitude"
of tltc problcnt. Whalen said.

Tltc University's Off-Campus
Housing Office predicts the
displacement of over i.000
students. should the grouper law
be totally enforced. Whalen. say-
ing he couldn’t comment on the
accuracy of the figures. asserted.
“if it‘s 1.000 displacements. i
don't look at that as bcirtg an un-
solvablc problem." adding. "if
that is the statistic then we can
take an aggcssive position with
Chancellor Wharton" to provide
temporary housing until SUNY
can contc up with something more
permanent. .

“This is something tlteUnivcr-

come to grips wittt." Whalen
said. "l‘m very serious when i
talk about next September," said
Whalen, referring to thc dcadlinc
he's set on enforcement of tltc
grottpcr law.

Whalen cxprcsscd his concern
over the impact the student hous-
ing problem could ltavc on the
fcity’s revitalization program.
“The last thing we want to do is
create another ghetto. and that‘s
precisely what we're doing along
Western Avenue with the student
population. unless we get it under
control."

Whalen said itc sees the solu-
tion to the housing problcrtt com-
ittg through the state providing
the University with ntore ntoncy
for housing. He also mentioned
other alternatives such as sub-
sidized housing elsewhere or a
returrt to the old “motel days“
when students lived in tltc Tom

that.“

"We don‘t platt any major
wholcsnle cjcctntcnt ofstudcnts."
Wltalcn said, adding “nobody’s
going to be thrown ottt on the
curb to tnakc do."

The mayor also said he expects
the University to assist on inform-
ing students about Albany's hous-
ing laws. Newly admitted
students. as well as returning
students. should be advised about
the housing situation in the
literature they receive over the
summer tttonths. he said.

Wltctt asked about what action
would be taken against landlords,
responded that the
grouper law was targeted at the
landlords so that property and
neighborhoods don’t deteriorate.
He added that they will be taking
landlords in violation of the
grouper law to court. and fines
will be administered. “We‘ve

noted.

Whalen also spoke about the
issue of whcthcr or not students
could vote in their college com-
munities. Whalen said that while
he abides by a judge's decision
allowing students to vote in their
college communities. he doesn’t
agree with it.

"i believe we should vote where
we have our roots. if you are here
on a temporary basis as a student
and have not intent to settle
here...you’re better off voting by
absentee ballot." he said.

Whalett said he didn’t “put an
awful lot of stock " in claims of
gerrymandering when questioned
as to why the SUNYA campus is
divided among four voting
districts.

"I‘m not concerned" about the
student vote impact on local elec-
tions because “students do rtot
