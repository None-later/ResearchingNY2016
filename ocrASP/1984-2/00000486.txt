(AP) Vengeance-seeking Hindus,

set ﬁres and beat up Sikhs across

Northern lndia Thursday venting '

their fury over the assassination

of lndira Gandhi by two of her -

Sikh guards. At- least 50 people

reportedly were killed and hun- ,.

dreds injured nationwide.
Authorities ordered a 24-hour

curfew in New Delhi and 15 other

cities. Police in some places were

given shoot-to-kill orders against .

the mobs and troops were sum-
moned to the capital from
neighboring states.

The United News of lndia said
more than 60 people were killed
nationwide. Hospital sources in
New Delhi told police more than
50 people were killed ands nearly
600 injured in_the capital alone.

The only government casualty
estimate came from Home
Secretary M.M.K. Wali, who told
reporters nine people had been
confirmed killed throughout
lndia.

Despite pleas for calm from
Mrs. Gandhi's son and successor,
Rajiv Gandhi, the estimated
crowd of 600,000 mourners ﬁling
past the flag-draped body of the
slain Prime Minister in New Delhi
became so unruly that the police
threw tear gas to restore order.

Sikh guards, United News of in-
dia reported. One of the accused
guards, constable Satwant Singh,
was killed by other security men,
and the second. sub-inspector
Beant Singh, was wounded,
authorities have said. A third
guard, who did not ﬁre. was ar-
rested. He has not been
identiﬁed.

The backlash in cities with Sikh
populations was part of a surge of
rioting, arson, and looting by
mobs of Hindus seeking revenge
for the killing of the 66-year-old
Mrs. Gandhi. The mobs burned
Sikh-owned businesses, cars and

buses, and beat Sikh men they
found in the open.

There was a two hour exchange
of gunfire today between police
and a “large group of people" in
a building near the Home
Ministry in New Delhi.

New Delhi’s deputy olice com-
missioner, Qumar Ahmed, said
the violence plunged New Delhi
into its “worst position since in-
dependence” from the British in
1947, when Hindu-Moslem
violence erupted.

The assassination Was clasimed
by anonymous Sikh extremists as
revenge for the lndian Army at-

tack on the Golden Temple in
Amritsar to flush out Sikh
separatists in June. Sikhs
numbered 13 million in the
predominantly Hindu nation of
730 million.

The Soviet news media today
hinted that the U.S. Central in-
telligence Agency may have been
involved in the assassination.
Reports from Radio Moscow, in
newspapers and from the official
news agency Tass condemned the
assassination of Mrs. Gandhi and
blamed it on “lndia‘s opponents
abroad." The press also publish-
ed reports about alleged ClA in-

 assaSSinatrion or Indira Gandhi

volvement with Sikh separatists
who advocate independence for
the Punjab state in northwestern
lndia. None of the Soviet reports
directly accused the CIA of
engineering Mrs. Gandhi's
assassination .‘

Mrs. Gandhi's body is to lie in
state for 24 hours. it is on a tilted

.bier in the “Teen Murti" house

where her father, Jawaharlal
Nehru, independent lndia‘s first
prime minister, lived and died.
Her head was covered by a pale
yellow sari, and her face appeared
sWollen.

The building is a few hundred
feet from the spot where in-
dependence leader Mohandas K.
Gandhi was assassinated by a
Hindu fanatic 37 years ago. He
was not related to Mrs. Gandhi.

The heavily regarded Rajiv, 40,
sworn in Wednesday as the new
prime minister, appeared tired
with bloodshot eyes and O ad-
monished mourners to stop chan-
ting the slogan “Blood for
blood."

The nation began a 12 day
period of mourning for the
woman who has governed the
world's largest democracy for 15
of the past l8 years. Her funeral
was set for Saturday, which was
declared a national holiday.

in Washington, State Depart—
ment officials said today that
Secretary of State George P.
Shultz may meet with Nikolai A.
Tikhonov, the No.2 official in the
Soviet government, while in New

In four hour effort, Council
fails to elect new vice-chair

By Roslyn A. Lewis '
Amidst a tense atmosphere and frequent
calls for quorum, Central Council met for
four hours Wednesday night in an effort to
replace former vice-chair Sal Perednia.
After many votes the election was tabled.

The nominees for vice chair, at various
times during the meeting, included Gregg
Stackel, Amy Koreen, Liz
Chestnut, Bob Pacenza and .
John Sayer. To be elected, a Central
candidate needed support -
from two-thirds of the 32 counc“
member council or more .
than 21 votes.

As the meeting continued ‘mcmbers
came and went, resulting in much confu-
sion and one vote in which there were 26

ballots cast while only 25 members were
present.

The meeting progressed as follows:

8:30. Council member Larry Hartmen
isformed the council of Perednia's resigna-
tion. He introduced the initial nominees,
Chestnut, Koreen and Stackel. Each gave a
short speech. Discussion and debate
followed. After several votes. there was no
winner. '

9:45. Stackel withdrew from the race.
Council members proceeded to direct
questions to the two remaining candidates.
The two stressed prior experience; Koreen
as a returning council member, Chestnu as
lndian Quad Board President’ in an at-
tempt to win majority support.

Addressing the problem of getting more
students involved in Central Council,
Chestnut called for more communication
with other clubs and use of the SA
Hotline. Koreen suggested more publicity
and drawing members from the live quad
boards. After several votes. with frequent
13/13 ties, there was no winner.

":15. Bob Pacenza accepted a nomina-
tion. At this point Steve Russo, acting vice

chair and Chair of the internal Affairs
Committee said. "Let's take politics for
what its worth...l urge you'to compromise

and vote for Bob."

Upon Paeenza‘s entrance to the race,
the tally of the first vote was Pacenza, 13;
Koreen, 8; Chestnut, 6.

After about a dozen votes, which did
not result in the necessary majority,
several members left the meeting.

“:45. Confusion with the ballots results
in an invalid vote. Twenty-six votes were
cast with only 25 members present at the
time of the vote.

Central Council Chair Mitch Feig said,
“i hope no one voted twice, if you did l'm
very angry." '

Pacenza and Koreen withdrew from the
race. '

Sayer accepted a nomination. in his ac-
ceptance speech, Sayer said. “Don't vote
for me as a compromise , vote for me
because you want me."

Following a series of questions anti some
debate, Sayer missed being elected by one
vote: Sayer, 2l;_Chestnut, 8.

Sayer withdrew from the race.

12:05. Koreen accepted a new nomina-
tion, after several arbitrary nominations of
almost every council member.

One council member pointed out, “this
is not a joke" and urged other members to
“take nominating someone seriously."

SA Vice President Suzy Aulctta inter:
jected at this point, "Its big bucks after 12
o‘clock." Student Association pays $20 an
hour for every they stay in the Campus
Center after midnight.

12:10. Russo proposed a bill to postpone
the election. The vote to postpone failed.

After more discussion and debate, a new
vote ended with no winner. Chestnut
received 13 votes, Korccn got 12 and Sayer

Heritage, future of black men
celebrated in week of events

By Pam Schusterman

A variety of events, including a dinner
and a Gospelfest will be kicked off at
SUNYA this Saturday in an attempt to
recognize the past contributions and
future potential of black men as part of
the first annual “Black Men's Week."

“it .will pay homage to black men of
years gone by, it unifies black men of
the present. and it serves to inspire black

“The idea will do a great
deal of good toward
creating a sense ff
community fon'black
men.” t' : .'

men of the future," said Todd Winn,
co-chair of the Albany State University
Black Alliance's Social-Cultural
Committee. /

“Black Men’s Week was originally
Black Week/— so this year they will be
running concurrently," added Todd.

"Black Men's Week was set up
because black men felt they played a
vital enough role in the community and
deserved to have one," said Todd.

Black, women have their week in the
spring, but black men felt they “had
enough going for them and wanted to
dedicate a week to themselves," Todd
said.

“The men think it is fair to have in
‘Men's Week also because they play (a)
vital role in taking strides in the black
community as a whole." Todd
explained.

Vice President for Student Affairs
Frank Pogue said, "i certainly think the

idea will do a great deal of good toward
creating a sense of community for black
men." He added that he believed “a
closely knit group will interact better
with black women and the community."

“in order to feel good and respect
others, you must first feel good about
yourselves." he said.

Pogue said he “plans to attend the
events and participate whenever
possible."

The week will begin with a basketball
tournament, which will run the entire
week long beginning at 2:00pm on
Saturday.

Sunday there will be a talent show at
7:00pm. “it is an open invitation for all
the events, anyone is encouraged to
come," said Todd.

Wednesday at 7:00pm there will he a
panel discussion on “Black Family,"
with the subtopic “the diminishing role
of black men in family."

Thursdasy there will be a Gospelfest,
and on Friday :1 dinner dance will be
hosted by ASUBA at 9pm.

The wrap-up for Black Men's Week
will include “Sophisticated Gents," at
fashion Show, at 9:00pm on Saturday.
“The Gents will be men from campus."
Todd said.

“This is meant for women," he said.
“but if men feel they must come in, ad-
mission is open. However, it is basically
for women.”

It will follow with a tribute to black
men from black women, then procedc to
it fashion show and finish with music for
dancing complete with a live DJ.

November 10 is the tentative date set
for the basketball championship, Todd
said, adding that ASUBA will be giving
out T-shirts to the winners opf the
basketball tournament as prizes.

Todd said he believes Black Men‘s
Week will be a success, and he hopes "it
will blaze a trail for next year and for
years to come." i"!

Bus driver, Sarlin finds, sh uttlin g Students ‘calm ’

By Christopher Blomquist
STAFF WRITER

Joe Sarlin has been driving the SUNYA
“Green Machine" buses for twelve years
now, and he still remains a calm
individual.

Shuttling tired and tense college students

is bound to have it‘s pro-
blems, but Sarlin says these '
are both rare and non- 
bothersome. “You’re '
always going to have trou- 
ble with people, but you
have to keep calm. i tend to relax and let it
go by the wayside. Th.s way everything is
forgotten. in general, the student popula-
tion is courteous and not much trouble,"
he said. '
Sarlin, sporting a bright red lacoste
sweater over a navy blue collared shirt.
spoke» froma cramped office over the bus
garage during his lunch break. The bus
driver, with neatly parted salt and pepper
haer, doesn’t seem to be bothered by
much.

Before working for SUNYA, Sarlin was
on the Capital Police Force from 1966-72.
Back then, he dealt with college students
too, but on less balanced terms. At one
point, he recalled he was put on the Riot
Squad and sent to New York City to pree-
vent demonstrations from getting out of
hand on state owned property there. But
he said he didn't find this assignment that
stressful either. “Most of it wasn‘t as bad
as people make it out to be," he explained.
Although there was occassional-violence,
he said it usually wasn't‘out of control. “l
agreed," he said, “with a lot of what they
believed in and i still believe that there
should be demonstrations for beliefs, but
they should be peaceful."

In contrast to the demonstration of the
sixties and the SUNYA students he drove
in the early seventies, he said that the
students he sees today are far more conser-
vative. in addition, he said, styles have
changed. Students wear “dressier” and
more "businesslike" clothes whereas
several years ago students dressed for the

purpose of “coming to school and having ‘

all sorts of demonstrations.”

Sarlin said he believes this new look is
reﬂective of student's plans for the future.
“What i see now is that students are look-
ing at careers and money. Before it wasn’t
like that. The general attitude then was

recalled. He then worked at APA
Transport, and finally settled down as a
SUNYA bus driver.

“l've been driving police cars, tractor'
trailers, and this now, which is quite a few
years of driving. i enjoy it though,

 

“You’re always going to have trouble with
people, but you have to keep calm. . . in
general the student population is courteous
and not much trouble. ”

‘let’s make this world what we want it to
be!" he explained.

After leaving the police force in 1972, he
made an attempt to form his own tractor
trailer business, but he couldn't get the
money together. The required down
payments were “out of my ballpark" he

especially the people. Otherwise, driving is
relatively boring. But it beats being in an
office," he asserted.

Because of the driver‘s irregular hours,
Sarlin said he doesn’t know all his col-
legues. but the ones he is acquainted with,

advisement

<Fronl Page

But, Reilly said, “i want to
make sure that the students
schedule? is a program that i
understand, as well as the stu—
dent." He asserted, “i will not
sign a blank schedule card."

There is a legal aspect to advise-
ment, which was established when
a student successfully sued his
school to obtain a degree which
he had been denied because he
had relied on his faculty advisors
incorrect interpretation of
academic requirements.

"Students at SUNYA would
have a difficult time" making a
case, according to SA attorney
Mark Mishler, “because the
undergraduate bulletin is detailed
and available.”

“Assuming that the informa-
tion is in the bulletin, the student
is obligated to read it,” he said.

Biology Professor Fred
Truscott said he takes his part of
the advisement contract seriously.
He said his emphasis is to “aid
the student in constructing a
schedule," not only for a given
semester but for future semesters
as well. “That way,” he added,
“the student ends up as an
educated individual.”

For those advisors and students
who find the mechanics of
scheduling does not leave them
time to pursue the how’s and
why’s of an education, help may
be on the way. According to
Associate Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Leonard Lipinski, “the
University has been exploring the
feasability" of a computerized
advisement and degree audit
program.

Acting Director of CUE Robert
Gibson said a program of this
type, if installed, “would take
care of the technical aspects of
advisement." which have become
“a mechanical chore" for
students and advisors.

Lipinski said, however, that
there is no certainty of insalling
such a program.

Some information for this story
was gathered by ASP staffwriter
Leslie Chait.
