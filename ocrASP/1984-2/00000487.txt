News Updates .

Nominations

Judith A. Ramaley, acting president
of SUNYA. is now accepting nomina-
tions for Distinguished Teaching Pro-
_fessor, artitlevgiven to professors who
meet the highest standard of teaching.
scholarship, and service.

The selection committee, composed
of an equal number of undergraduate
students and faculty, will be responsible
for screening the candidates and
building the required support ﬁle.

In order to be eligible. teaching facul-
ty must have achieved the rank of full
professor and must have completed at
least three years of full-time teaching on
this campus.

Candidates must also regularly teach
at least one half of their assigned load at
the undergraduate level. Nominators
must be prepared to assume full respon-
sibility for gathering the necessary
credentials and letters of support.

New ad policy

At an Editorial Board meeting
Wednesday night the Albany Student
Press(ASP) enacted a new policy which

'prohibits the solicitation of models in
the Classified Ads.

Exceptions can be made only through
direct consultation and receipt of per-
mission from the Editor-in Chief.

Current Editor-in-Chief David L.L.
Laskin said “We‘re not just concerned
with money, we’re concerned with
principles.”

Directories are out

Student directories are now being
distributed via the campus mail to quad
offices and eventually to students
rooms. The directories list all ad-
ministrators, faculty. and student phone
numbers. ‘

Students that had registered before
the September 19 deadline have their
phone numbers listed. Those who did
not have their phones hooked up or
those who changed rooms after the
dcadlinearc not listed in the directory.

The administration met their goal this

 

 

year by putting out the directory, by the
first week in November. Last year's
directories did not come out until late
spring because the company making the
directories went bankrupt. r

This year there will he no yellow pages
in the directory because the University is
not allowed to print ads in a government
publication. The directories, which the
University itself prints up, are con-
sidered official government
publications. .

Library alters tours

SUNYA’s library offers a self-guided
tour pamphlet with tour information to
offer assistance to those not familiar
with the library.

The pamphlet provides a guide to
each floor, explaining the various
sources of information and how to ob-
tain them. ‘

The twelve page pamphlet leads a tour
through the library. going directly from
one section of the library to the next. ex-
plaining in detail what each section

' offers.

The self-guided tour pamphlets are
available in the library lobby. inquire at
the reference desk for more
information.

Record sales double

Record sales at SUNYA‘s record co-
op havc doubled since last year, said the
co-op's manager Norman Kee, at-
tributing it partly to the co-op's early
opening this year.

The co-op has expanded its inventory
by adding more hard-core records. pre-
recorded tapcs and by introducing a new
display case of buttons.

A new display of the top ten records,
more imported records than last year,
and a new option to order oldies singles
by mail have expanded the product line
the co-op offers to its customers.

Recently, in cooperation with
WCDB, the co-op has run a promotion
of Polygram rccording artists the Vcls, a
New York City disco band, by selling
llic hard to find album at a discount
pricc.

 

 

budget

<Fronl Page

changes legislators deem necessary, they
will pass a revised budget by the April I
deadline.

SUNY Central Communications Officer
Harry Charleton said that the budget re-
quest ittcludcd no tuition hike or room fee
hike.

“The SUNY Board of Trustees are very
rcluctant to raise the tuition for students.”
said Charleton, noting that because this
years state budget surplus, state funds
could be redirected toward the SUNY
budget.

“We are really at the mercy of the ar-
chitect of the state budget." said
Charleton.

According to SUNYA’s Final Budget
Request, the existing physical education
building, occupied since 1968 for a pro-
jected enrollment of9,000 students, can no
longer meet the needs of the 16,000
studebts enrolled.

Because of increasing female participa-
tion in intramural, recreation and inter»
collegiate activities, SUNYA’s athletic
facility. even after alteration by the cam-
pus, cannot accomodate the needs of
female athletes, according to the request.

The SUNYA Budget Request also pro-
poses to construct 150 on-campus apart-
ment units for graduate students.

According to the SUNYA final budget
request. “the university proposes to con-
struct 150 apartment units on the campus
for graduate student housing. 40 percent
of the units should be studios, 40 percent
one-bedroom [units], and 20 percent two-
bedroom units." The units should also
contain a kitchen. bathroom ,and living
room, the proposal says.

“We have a critical necd for graduiate
housing at Albany,“ said Freedman, ad-
ding that SUNYA would operate these
units as part of its total hottsing program.

The SUNYA Budget Request points out
that in recent years residence halls have
opeucd at ovcr 100 percent of the desired
capacity. and indicates this may be a cause
of property damage in the halls.

“Further, the impact of stttdents living
off campus is changing the character of
established neighborhoods in the western
sections of Albany and represents a serious
campus - commttnity problem," concludes
the SUNYA Budget Request.

THe additional student housing asked
for by the proposal will not materialize,
though. “unless we are sure that it is self-
subsidized." said Freedman.

The apartments, according to the re-
quesl, would require twelve month leases.

Assistant to Vice Chancellor of Finance
and Business Bill Anslow said that the
State Division of the Budget “Will con-
sider the proposal for a cottplc of months
before any decision is made."

“While the economy and state revenues
look good. there are other things for the
state to look at." said Anslow.

The budget proposal .also includes re—
quests for increased funds in the SUNY—
wide tuition waiver program and also in
undergraduate and graduate Equal Oppor-
tunity Programs, Anslow said.

“Several sources contribute to SUNY's
budget," said Charlcton, noting that a tui-
tionand room fee hike could be avoided if
the state directed more funds of its surplus
budget towards SUNY’s budget.

“The main source is tax dollars," said
Charleton of the SUNY budget, adding
that “this is the critical part." El
