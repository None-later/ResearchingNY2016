down at the red mass on his shoulder, and began to
weep. We were all locked in one silence and could
not move.

Then the (aptarn spoke. "Quite right,“ he said,
the lines deepening around his rrrotrttr. "This could
not go on. Throw it ovr-rlroard. The inquiry is
finished." He turned to the I‘rolcssor. “You,” he
said. "Tho whole thing is ( luar cnouglr. I'm holding
you on charges of mutilation and murder. until we
reach the port,"

"You can’t,” said tllt‘ Professor. .

"Why not?"

"For several reasons. I have studied this carefully.
For one thing, because this young man delivered-
llru death blow. We all saw him. You can't deny it.
thrt even ignoring that, because you have all killed
him. You none of you wanted this resurrection.
You did not rejoice at the signs of returning life.

"You'see," said the Professor. "You cannot indict

The Captain frowned. His voice was loud and
clear. "Nevertheless," he said, "I shall hold yrr for
this crime. I shall contact the authorities .rrrd they
shall try the case when we reach port. It is not quitt-
clear in my mind why I must do this. but it seems
to me like a correct action."

"As you please," said the Professor. He turned to
_llre girl. "And until my trial?” he asked. “We don't
reach port for some while.”

She raised her tread and looked up at him quit-l-

West Comes East

continued from 3:

The guitars are what highlight the music,
but it is the much improved rhythm section
of Packenham and Staydohar that hold the
songs together. Packenham’s drums pound
from beginning to end of this cut which is
what sets him apart from their previous
drummers.

Closing out side one is “What About
You”, the spaciest song on the album. its
definitely a song to sit back and enjoy.
Staydohar's bass is more prorninant here,
and the guitars are sharp and biting.

Side two opens with a bang with “Hold
One", another catchy, upbeat number
which just glides along so nicely that you
never realize that it’s almost four minutes
long, which is another mark of a good
band. Once again I can just feel the Califor-
nia breeze blowing through my hair. There
are some nice pace changes here which pre-
vent the song from ever becoming
monotonous. Tolman is the primary

' songwriter, as he is on “HoldOn”, and his
compositions are excellent. On this cut, he
leaves a good margin of space for the
listener to enjoy the instruments alone, for
when Blair is singing, it‘s just so easy to
concentrate on his superb voice. Tolman

 

and McGrath seem to habitually switch off
on lead and rhythm guitar, and either way
is a very strong combination.

"And Then The Rain” is a cut that was
previously released, but this is a slower,
prettier, dreamier version of it. it is another
of the more psychadellically flavored songs
with great "Kaleidoscope" guitar.
“Background Bridge Song" is the pick hit
off the album in that it has a very catchy
chorus, fast hard beat, and quick guitar
solos.

“Ain't No Hangnan“ is a nice twist. It’s a
pretty country-folk ballad which centers
around Blair, and “Morning Light" is
another flash of versatility. it has a camp-
fire sing-a-long taste to it. You can fust see
the crowd singing with Blair at a live show.

All in all, Drifters is a very string effort,
complete with guest appearances (Chris
Cacavas of Green on Red doing organ and
piano, and Sid Griffin and Steve McCarthy
of the Long Ryders on backing vocals)
which I'm certain has helped the band shed
the psychadelic label, and show the world
that True West is one very versatile and
talented band. 50 catch them at 288 Lark
on Wednesday, or WCDB anytime! Cl

Republican state senatorial challenger
Joseph C. Frangella said he opposes
SUNY tuition hikes —- but didn't reveal
what measures be support to avert any
increases.

Frangella, who is trying to unseat an in-
cumbent who has been in the Senate for
ten years, cited the successful efforts of
- Republican state Senators to halt TAP
funding decreases. but didn't state his own
position on the matter.

He was, however, emphatic in his sup-
port for maintaining the drinking age at
l9. "If you raise the drinking age, you're
going to drive drinking underground,” he
said. He added he wouldn’t support a law
‘ “that my own kids wouldn’t obey.”

Saying he would not favor a legislative
mandate to move SUNY sports programs
from Division ill to Division 1 college
athletics, Frangetla said, “1 would respect
the wishes of the SUNY Board and the
students."

Steven Gates
Republican

Steven Gates, a Republican running for
Albany County judge, contends that ire
will be “fair, firm and free from in-
fluence" if elected in the November 6
elections.

Gates says he sees himself as “a man of
experience,” according to the Gates for
Albany County Judge committee. He has
been a Prosecuting Attorney in two coun-
ties, as well as a Defense Attorney.

Educated at Amherst College and
Albany Law School, Gates has been a
practicing trial attorney for over 15 years.
He says he is ready to devote his next ten

' years “to the job of county judge” Gates
said.

Gates says he feels that as a 42 year old
attorney, he is “ﬂexible enough" in his
mental attitude to “make innovative.

 

     

down a Division 1 proposal last month
after students demonstrated in opposition
to the move. “Why should the legislature
or anybody else force them to do
something they don’t feel is in their best in-
terest?" asked Frangella.

Tire challenger said he supported a state
Equal Rights Amendment as long as there
are no provisions 'within the law that
would permit Medicaid-funded abortions.

Frangella did not take a firm stand on
having SUNY Central divest its holdings in
corporations with investments in South
Africa. Student lcaders have repeatedly
called for this measure because of the
country's policy of apartheid.

“The people in charge would have to see
what is most beneficial to SUNY,” he
said, adding that unless SUNY officials
believe divestiture is beneficial, SUNY
should not be forced into the policy.

Frangetta opposes the state‘s new seat
belt law, because, he said, it’s “an infr-
ingement of the rights of choice." The
issue, he claimed, is not between seat belts
and saving lives, but concerns the curtail-
ment of individual freedom.

Forcing drivers to wear seat belts is just
an opener to increased government in-
volvement in private affairs, said
Frangella. “The next thing you know, it'll
be something else,”‘ he contended.

Frangella. a Slingerlands resident, said
he has spent 28 years in politics; to years as
Albany County Republican Party Chair
and 8 years as Secretary of the New York
State GOP Committee.

Frangella also mentioned his tenure as
Coeymans town chair from 1960 to l966
and his two year term on the Coeymuns-
Ravcna-Selkirk school board in the 1960‘s.

He added that he used to work for his
family-owned mushroom business until it
closed down two years ago. He had been
working as a consultant to his son’s food

creative decisions in how cases are handled
in county court."

In a letter to his committee, Gates stated
that he did not want his campaign commit-
tee to accept contributions from any
political party.

“Once elected," Gates said, “I want no
questions of subtle inﬂuence cvcr raised
regarding my decisons."

Gates says he feels he has a “young and
modern outlook" on issues, and an “un-
compromising integrity.“ These factors,
he says. should help him on his campaign.

In addition. Gates is using his own fun-
ding, and his own effort, in order to show
that “one individual can make a dif-
ference," he said, stressing that students at
SUNYA he was sure “would respect such
courage."

Adding that the Democratic Party has
controlled Albany politics since l920,
Gales maintained that “political parties
should not play as big a role as they do,
especially with judges.” ['3

Demonstrating a split record on gorsn-
mon student concersn. State Senator
Howard Nolan, currently running for re-
election in Albany, said he voted in favor
of killing a SUNY tuition hike last year,
but co-sponsored legislation to raise the
state drinking age from 19 to 21.

Calling the statistics staggering, Nolan
said that if the problem of drunk drivers is
to be solved, young people under 21 must
lose the right to purchase aird consume
aleoholoci beverages.

He said he sympathized with 19 and 20
year olds who did not abuse alcohol and
driving, but “unfortunately a lot of people
have to pay for the sins of a few."

Nolan voted in favor of a bill last year
which killed Governor Cuomo's proposed
$200 tuition hike. He also said he sup-
ported the TAP increases which were a
part of the final state budget.

ALBANY JUDGESHIP RACES

John Turner was appointed to the posi-
tion of County Court Judge earlier this
year, by Governor Mario Cuomo.

Turner, running on the Democratic and
Conservative party lines, explained that all
felony crimes fall rrnder the jurisdiction of
County Court.

“Murders, rapes - things that girls
would like to be protected from - arson. all
serious crimes are dealt with in county
court and rrorvlrcre else," Turner
explained.

in drunk driving cases, he said, ire has
tried “to couple some dclercnl jail time
with alternative programs," and that he
“would like people to be helped forever."

Turner said Ihat he practiced law for 28
years, and that he had served for six years
as a part time city court judge.

“This isn’t new to me," he said. rcfering
to the court system in Albany.

He noted that. while serving as city
court judge, several cases involving
student-landlord conﬂicts over the return
of security deposits had come to his cour-
lroom. “We tried to do justice quickly,"
Turner said, reporting that “students were
generally successful" in getting their
deposits back. -

“I’m probably as non-political as one
cab gel," Turner said, adding however.
“l've been a democrat all my life."

Included in Turner‘s list of qualifica-
tions, is experience in Albany City Court
Judge from 1979-1983 and as assistant
district attorney from 1961-1968. He was a
partner in Rosenstock and Turner, at-
toneys at law, and has studied at Siena
College and Albany Law School. C]

While he said, “We have to (teas much
as possible to increase student assistance."
Nolan admitted he had no speciﬁc ideas
where additional funding could be found,
as he rejected additional business or per-
sonal tax increases.

Supporting both state and federal Equal

Rights Amendments as a way to insure -

women get paid the full value of their
labor, he said an ERA would “make sun:
that women are paide equal money for
equal work."

Nolan blasted the Republican controlled
State Senate, saying, “i think it was an ab-
solute disgrace that the Republican majori-
ty refused to allow the Senate to vote on
that issue (ERA) this year."

A move by some SUNY schools to
NCAA Division 1 sports is favored by
Nolan, but he said students must be given
a chance to add input on the decision,
possibly through on-campus public
hearings. .

Because of the racial-{discrimination
policies of the South African government,
Nolan said he supports forbtng SUNY to
sell its investments in companies doing
business with the countryi “i think that
we've really got to start; putting the
economic screws to South;Mrica in order
to get them to get rid of ‘that policy of
apartheid." , ‘

Anthony Cardona stresses his [0 years
experience in family and matrimonial law
as well as his sensitivity and commitment
to the people involved in these cases as
reasons to elect him as Albany County
Family Court Judge.

Cardona, who is running on the
Democratic line, said he has practiced law
for 14 years. Family Court, he said, “has
just been my whole professional life."

“l’ve been down there for 10 years."
Cardona said, referring to his experience

blems,” such as scheduling and sensitivity,
