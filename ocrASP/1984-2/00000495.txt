he likes. “The only ones I get to
know are those driving the day
shift. They're great to work
with.” he said.

Even the new and controversial
bus fee hasn't given Sarlin any
trouble. “Generally there are no
problems. There hasn't been a
bitch to me," he noted. However,
he believes it is a positive move.
He said, “It's definitely going to
help as far as money being ap-
propriated for it (the bus system).
It had to come to this. It puts a
small dent into what the cost ofit
(maintaining the buses) is."

Concerning the safety of winter
driving, he explained. “The buses
are heavy enough to usually not
slide, but when it does slide
there's a problem since it is a large
vehicle. Usually there's good trac-
tion in the snow."

Driving the “Green
Machine"is not Sarlin’s only job.
Over the summer he worked as an

' active" in

 

electrician at the Albany dock
area where he installed lighting
and ballis. Eventually, he would
like to become a full time electri-
cian. and. at 55. retire to Myrtle
, Beach with his wife.

In addition, he took the Civil
Service Exam for Park Police,
Meat Inspector, and Motor Vehi-
cle Inspector and he said. scored
generally well. But even with his
good scores, he didn't get any of-
fers. “Not even a call. That's how
tough it is now to get a statejob.“
Sarlin said. “Back in the sixties."
he recalled. “statcjobs were plen-
tiful. it was easy."

Sarlin is also interested in
sports, and plays basketball. soft—
ball. and tennis in his birthplace
of Amsterdam, N.Y.. and his cur-
rent hometown of Colonic.

He also follows SUNYA teams
and says they play well. “For the
ball players, they do well with
what they have. I think it’s

because of quality coaching," he
stated. [It

just acting as Reagan's right hand
in the EPA."

. “NYPIRG and the students
protesting have a really good
point" according to SA President
Rich Schaffer, who observed the
protest and attended the speech.

Schaffer said he “personally
disagrees with Burford’s policies,
as well as her conduct as a govern-
ment ofﬁcial.”

Ticket-holder Robin Kash said
she believed “they have every
right to protest. but they should
also be here to listen to her
speak."

toxic dump clean-up programs

- and management. because Presi-

dent Ronald Rcagan had in-
structcd her to withhold all in for-

‘ . motion, saying it was a matter of
' _ executive privilege.

The former EPA head spoke to
a crowd of approximately 70 pcov
pic in the ballroom. Shc talked

 about her background with the

EPA, saying she had been “very

vironmental issues.

She described 400 health

the country and contended that

 the regulations she helped develop

worked to clean up these areas.
The regulations are “stringent,
they are good controls and they
are certainly overdue." she
asserted.

Burford said she believes one

1 way to deal with toxically con-

taminated soil is to incineratc it.
“The dirt at (one) New Jersey site
really should have been in-

“ cincratcd." she said. “but it was

simply unl‘casihlc in terms of
cost."

 Whalen

Hc contended that there are
two reasons for the division ol'thc
districts. One is that part of the
campus is located in the town of

v Guilderlund. and the other, he
r said, is that the city is trying to ac-

comodatc both voting popula-

" tions (residents and students) with
\ polling places.

He commented on last year's
conflict with SUNYA’s Student
Association over on-campus poll-
ing places, saying, “(SA Presi-
dent Rich) Schaffer and I got into
a big hassle about a year ago. He

admitted. but it is generally a very
good government for its people,
he said. providing free health care
and education. He lauded his
governments priorities of pro-
viding for basic human needs for
trying to supply luxuries such as
Adidas sneakers- for its citizens
through trade with the capitalist
world. “I love my country," he
said.

Barnet stressed that although
Cuba was indebted to the Soviet
Union for its economic welfare,
Cuba's artistic legacy owed a lot
to the United States. “We are on—
ly 90 miles from you," he said.
and cited American authors like
Hemmingwuy and Faulkner as
American inﬂuences on Cuban

people in the audience. and, In-
deed, many of the protesters did
proceed to the speech after the

~ rally.

Although there was no vocal
disruption of thespecch, some in~
dividuals continbed an indepen-
dent protest by flashing signs with
“That's a lie" or more colorfully,
“That’s garbage" when they
disagreed with Burford's
statements. '

Members at the Student Ac-
tivities crew gave two warnings to
Tom Gaveglia to put his sign
away before they asked him to
leave the room. which he did.

Gaveglia stressed that his was a
silent protest. "When she made

Burford described herself as an
efficient. effective administrator
caught in a “circus
:Itomosphcre,“ and said she was
used as a test cast with respect to
the use of executive power.

She said orders from President
Reagan for her to withold
documents relating to the super
fund were an attempt to test in-
herent powers of the Constitu-
tion. She added that her attorneys
assured her that they had a “solid
case" which would “establish the
executive power forever."

Burford was held in contempt
of Congress for her failure to
reveal these documents.

During the question and answer
period following her speech. Bur-
ford was faced with specific ques-
tions from the crowd.

Throughout the session, Bur-
ford denied having a a ques-
tionablc environmental record
but was met by hisscs and com-
ments from the crowd.

Burford defended herself when
asked how she could still consider
herself a public official after her
Congressional indictment by say-
ing. “There was no evidence
whatsoever to support any of the

“I don't know if I'd get involv-

almost all those attending agreed
that “his modesty was unwar-

In response to a question about
her achievements in the EPA she
said. “The air is cleaner, the

something about the accumula-
tion of hazardous moterinls...l'm
very proud of my record.” That
was met with jccrs of “You‘re off

When asked what she would
spend her $3.500 speaking fee for.
Burford's brief reply was “I’m
going to put it in my bank
account."

Efrem Kenn, project coor-
dinator of NYPIRG at SUNYA
said he thought Speaker's Forum
was overly protective of Burford.
especially with respect to handling
of the question-answer period.
Questions had to be written down
and were later presented by
Speaker’s Forum officials.

Kann said that the NYPIRG
demonstration was not a protest
of Burford's presence at SUNYA
but of her policies. However. he
added, he personally regretted
that she was benefiting from the

William Kennedy, Pulitzer

of the Writer's Institute con-
sidered the talk "excellent."
Jeanne Finley, the lnstitute's
Assistant Director, said it was
"fantastic."

Finley. like Barnel. is both a

poet and a novelist and was par- v

ticularly pleased by Barnct’s
response to her qulery about the

difference between poetry and Ti

prose; “Nothing,” he said.
“there is no difference."
