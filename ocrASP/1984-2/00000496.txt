As minorities there may have
en times when we experienced a
. ose encounter with racism and
scrimination. Although we
ow deep within that some bias
d prejudice has denied us an
portunity, often this is very

ften we have consciously and
consciously been victims of
reir negative impacts. When
terted to these injustices and our
V ctimizations, we often have a
I ugh time trying to validate our
ﬁaim as we try to point the
ngers of guilt at the culprit.
Although racism and

“aiscrimination are sometimes dif—
ijcult to prove, we must not
w' ence our opposing views and let
ese acts go unnoticed. In doing
, not only will we be minorities
gmerically, but we will stay

The percentage of minorities
attaining R.A. positions is her-
rendous. Is this associated with
racism and discrimination? It
most certainly is. I'm not saying
that racism is the sole reason for
the low quantity of minorities
holding R.A. positions, but what
I am saying. is that it certainly is
one of the factors contributing to
this problem.

First, not many minorities app-
ly for the R.A. position because
they feel that they will be
discriminated against. Or if they
do become an R.A. (by some
chance), they fear being uncom-
fortable, not fitting in. because
nine times out of ten, they will be
one out of the two minorities at—
taining the position (if not the on-
ly one).

Secondly, for the minorities
who do apply, the odds are
against them. But if there are only
one of two minorities applying,
the chances are that at least one
will receive the R.A. position,
after all, politics must come into
play. By granting one minority
the position helps them disprove
any claims of racism. But we
know better!

Moreover, during the R.A.
process the dorm directors have
the final interview with the R.A.
applicants. This interview carries
a lot ofweight. There are very few
minority dorm directors at this
university. So once again, the
odds are against the minorities
throughout the whole process.

ing in the family court for ll
years and his “plan of action"
would include increased use of
dispute mediation and a child
stress prevention education
program.

Cardona said that Family
Court was the most important
trial court because it deals wih
parent and child conflict.

He said he's been a practicing
attorney for fourteen years and
that he devoted himself to the
Family Court ten years ago. He
also conducted a Forum on the
Family Court which helped in-
crease-- communication between
different branches of family
court, he said.

On a more personal note, I ap-
plied for the R.A. position last
semester. After receiving the final
interview, I was rejected. l was
one of the three black applicants
who had applied for my quad.

After requesting feedback, the
reasons being given for my non-
acceptance were: I was too “cli-
quey," meaning I stayed with my
same group of friends, and 1 ap-
peared to be easily intimidated.

I admit that all denials of op-
portunities for minorities are not
just racial factors, however, this
was discrimination.

First, most of all the R.A.‘s
have one set of friends that are
their primary group. Did this
restriction deny them the oppor-
tunity? No, it didn't. My friends
were minorities. and it was this
fact that gave them one strike
against me.

I cannot even give clarification
to the suggestion of being easily
intimidated as a part of my non—
acceptance because of its
bizareness. The most I can say,
was that it was an added excuse
for my denial of the R.A.
position.

Many of us have felt the
dsicriminations existing in the
R.A. process while applying.
However, although we were in-
nately certain we were the victims
of bias and partiality. we found it
difficult to declare and validate
anyone‘s guilt.

In having the Inajority in R.A.
positions, the discriminations of

Rothschild. who Organized the

credibility and “legitimizcs
students as a voting block," The
"next step is to get out the vote."
he said, “then we'll be taken
seriously."

Student Action Committee
Chair Steve Gawley attributed the
large turnout in part to other stu-
dent organizations. "Student
groups have a lot of vitality,” he
said. “and they brought a lot of
people."

“We want to do a lot better
than last year" in voter turnout,
and then he added. "We'll build,
from this year."

minorities are encouraged. Many
times we are called .to turn down
the music by R.A.'s when
courtesy hours are not in effect.
Our dormitory nieghbors make
complaints that we are talking,
walking or snoring too hard. It
may sound bizarre, but it's true.

We are paying the same
amount of money to live in the
dorms and we are often made to
feel unwelcome and unequal.
Often R.A.‘s are biased and onlv

subjective to the feelings of ' the
majority. '

This article was written as a
result of the silenced thoughts of
the minorities, with the fervent
hope that some change will come.

Before we can rise and declare

unity and equality in our society ,

and oommunities, -we must
declare unity and equality within
our homes. In this case, it's the
dorms, so let’s clean up the dirt of
racism and discrimination. El
