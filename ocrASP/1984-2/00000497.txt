Learn thesevoting rights

before you cast your ballot

By Mark Mishler .
On October 9, 1984 United States
District Court Judge Neil P. McCurn
decided that students in New York State
must be treatet in the same manner as
other citizens in regard to eligibility to
register and vote. Holding phat New
York’s constitutional and statutory provi-
sions limiting student voting ‘ '
violated the US. Constitution,  5
Judge McCurn essentially made
permanent the terms of a the
preliminary injunction he had
issued in 1980. Law

SUNYA students should have
a sense of pride._regarding this landmark
decision as the case was initiated four years
ago by a group of SUNYA students who
had been denied the right to vote in Albany
County.

Despite Judge McCurn’s decision, some
students might still encounter difficulties
when they attempt to vote on election day.
This article will discuss certain problems
which might arise on election day and will
describe your rights if an obstacle is
encountered.

Two types of problems are likely to arise
for student voters on election day: the poll-
ing place may have no record of your
registration or a record of registration does
exist but someone challenges your right to
vote. In both situations the law says that
you must be allowed to vote if you follow

‘Icertain procedttres outlined below.

‘ The polling place might not have a
record of your registration because some
confusion has existed regarding which
dorms are in which district and you might
have been placed in the wrong district by
mistake.

Section 8-302 of the Election Law pro-
vides a procedure for dealing with this
situation. The election official must allow
you to fill out an affidavit (which must be

, supplied to you) stating that you have duly

registered to vote, the address in the elec-
tion district from which you registered,
that you remain qualified to vote in the
election district (i.e., you have not moved

Aid cutbacks

since submitting your registration), and
that your registration poll record appears
to be lost or misplaced. If you sign and
swear to this affidavit you will be allowed
to vote by paper ballot.

if the polling place does have a record of
your registration, it is possible that so-
meone at the polls (such as a poll watcher
or an election inspector) will challenge
your right to vote. As is the case with lost
or misplace registrations, you will be
allowed to vote if challenged as long as you
follow certain procedures. Section 8-504 of
the Election Law sets out the procedure to
be followed in this situation. The election
inspector will ask you to swear to an oath
known as the “preliminary oath" in which
you will swear to answer truthfully to
questions which may be put to you concer-
ning your qualifications as a voter. The in-
spector may then ask you quesitons regar-
ding the reason your right to vote was
challenged. You must answer any ques-
tions asked by the inspector if they are
relevant to your qualificatins to vote. if
the inspector is satisfied with your
qualifications or if the challenge is
withdrawn, you will be permitted to vote.
ll"the inspectr continues to believe that you
are not eligible to vote, you must be allow-
ed to take an oath known as the
"qualification oath" in which you will
swear that you are at least eighteen years
old, that you are a citizen of the United
States and that you have been a resident of
New York State and of Albany County for
at least thirty days preceeding the election,
that you still reside at the same address
from which you registered, that you have
not already voted in this election, and that
you do not know of any reason why you
are not qualified to vote at this election.
You will also have to state that you are
aware that it is a crime to make any false
statement. You must be allowed to vote if
you take the oaths administered by the
election inspector.

If you experience any difficulties at the
polls on election day. please call the Stu—
dent A 'ociation at 457-8087.

could cause

decline in black enrollment

. Durham, NC
(COLLEGE PRESS saavtCE) Black colleges

'and campuses that Lenroll students from

lower-income house olds are apt to suffer
more drastic‘enrollment, declines if finan- q
cial aid budgets continuelto fall,'a Univer-;
sity of Chicago professor recently warned
a national conference on"‘desegregation
here.  " V  » ; 

“The impact of aid cuts is gre‘atdr, on
black schools whiohhave more: ‘studehts‘
from poor families,”._ said‘Edt'ication Pro-
fessor Edgar Epps. “If the current finan-
cial aid policy continuesto be‘restrictive, I
expect enrollment at all, colleges serving
poorer students will show enrollment
declines.” ’37.

Student aid cuts approaching '20 percent
over the past four years already have
reduced enrollment at a nutnber of black
colleges. Epps pointed out in a phone in-
terview, and caused» a large number of
mid-year drop-outs. More students are at.-
tending» college part-time. he told the Na-
tional Conference on Desegrcgation in
Postsecondary Education at North
Caroline Central University recently,
because they can‘t al‘fort full-time tuition.

Guaranteed Student Loans havesaved
some schools from significant enrollment
drops, but “we will definitely be in trouble
if the economy changes and lending in-
stitutions find something else to do with
their money." predicted Jeanette Huff,
financial aid director at Fort Valley State
College in Georgia. “About 96 percent of
our students receive somr kind of financial
aid," she said. “And if lenders withdraw
the funds, we won’t have a college."

Huff estimates the college would retain
only 17 to 20 percent of its students if cur-
rent funding sources disappeared. “Not
enough for us to open our doors,” she
commented.

Even the University of the District of
Columbia, where public budget appropria-
tions keep tuition low and most students

=. are ineligible for financial aid, has suffered

some cutback, admitted Dwight Cropp,
vice president of resource management
and development. “The aid cuts have been
felt in terms of growth of our non-resident
student population," he explained.

Private schools may face even tougher
times than public colleges. Epps said.
because their higher tuition is forcing
students into less expensive state colleges.
“These private colleges usually have only
small endowments,” he explained. “50
they depend to a large extent on tuition
and fees."

While black'conimunities solidly sup‘
port traditionally black colleges, Epps
recommended schools take decisive steps
to combat financial aid woes. "Colleges
need to offer programs that are attrac-
tive," he stressed. “And schools must be
flexible in offering them, especially at cott-
venient times for working students."

Schools also mttst find new ways for
students to tinance their educations,
cultivate new sources of private funding
and recruit students aggressively, Epps
noted. “Schools need to do a better job of
selling themselves," he maintained.

Without these innovations. Epps said,
“it’s doubtful that some of these institu-
tions will survive." E]

singles and moved up to ﬁrst doubles to
play with Grossman. Schmitz believes that
Grossman has helped his doubles game
this past year.

“Last fall Grossman and Ulrich won
every match," said Schmitz. “l'm not that
rent of a doubles player and neither 1 nor
1 Karen had it shot that put anybody away.
Grossman does, he’s so fast. I set Dave up
ometimes. We‘ve gotten to know each
ther's games and compliment each
ther."

Grossman said, "David Ulrich and l
omplimented each other from the start.
ommy and I had to learn to do it. but
i ow we play good."

Eisenberg comes from Old Bethpage
‘ here he played high school tennis for
lainview J.F.K. He was all set to go to
chool in Buffalo when Coach Bob Lewis
as on Long Island for a tournament.
‘ i isenberg met both Lewis and Grossman

Dane netmen: aclose unit

there. ‘

That first year Eisnberg recalls, “i
played sporatically only playing a handful
of matches subbing itt at different places. I
didn’t lose a match that year." His
sophomore year he moved to fifth singles
and won the SUNYACs at that spot.
without losing a single set in the
tournament.

This year he moved to third singles and
began playing second doubles with Mike
Dermansky. He was named team captain
by election, an honor Eisenberg cherishes.

“l’m really honored that they picked
me.” said Eisenberg. “It's nice coming
from them in that it's a sign of their ap-
proval." As for the duties of a captain,
Eisenberg said, “l try to be there for sup-
port, helping out the new guys more and I
try to be a good team player.”

Schmitz likens the captain to a den
mother.

“Dermansky forgets enough clothes and

l .lay provides them for him," joked

Schmitz. “Sometimes I forget where I
leave things and he finds them. He makes
sure the whole team eats right and gets
plenty of sleep.”

Grossman feels Jay'is the perfect man to
be captain. “Jay has a way of getting
psyched. He wants everyone to do well and
he wants to do well. Even If he lost and the
rest of the team won he'd be very happy,"
said Grossman.

With the close of a successful fall
season. all three are looking ahead to the
spring. “The spring will be good and our
senior year will be the climax of it," said
Schmitz. Grossman said, “Coach Lewis
made it a fun season. I think he’s looking
forward to working with us again in the
spring. ln tennis especially, a coach and
player relationship is very tough. lt's im-
portant to have a good outlook of the
coach."

Grossman has a good chance of making
the Nationals this spring in both singles
and doubles. Schmitz feels his best shot is

l- “I do have a shot at singles "that: tlcll-
.ly, but it's so slim," said Schmitz. “Going
' to the Nationals would be really nice."
Eisenberg, too, wants to qualify for the
Nationals “if not this year than next‘."
Grossman feels Schmitz, Eisenberg. and
Dermansky. and himself can interchange
on any given day.

 

"Whatever position you're in even at
number one the guy behind you is always
looking ahea ." said Grossman. “They
try to beat you, but still are your friends.»
We still help each other. I helped Jay with
his volley and Mike pointed out a
backhand problem I was having."

Eisenberg said that friendship plays a
large in the success of a team.

“We are a very close knit team. We’re
all really good friends. Grossman is one of
my best friends." said Eisenberg. “We all
like each other on and off the court. And
that’s what makes this whole thing an en-
joyable experience." Cl

“I tookmy eyes off the receiver
and looked for the ball," said
Anderson, before yesterday's
practice. “When you do that you
provide a separation between you
and the receiver.
“The Hofstra game bothered
.me for a while," he continued.
“But it's something you can’t
dwell on and have to overcome."
Chris Da’mico will be the
receiver the Dancs will have to
look out for.
“We‘re going to use various
zones against them," said Ander-
son. “They don’t have a strong
running game. We know they’re
going to pass the ball."
In the Danes’ favor, two of
Buffalo’s losses have been against
opponents the Danes have
beaten, Ithaca and Cortland.
