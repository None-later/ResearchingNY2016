New Orleans, LA
(AP) The 1984 World's Fair, threatened by
a multitude of lawsuits from creditors try-

bankruptcy laws.

The fair ﬁled for bankruptcy protection
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, said George Williams, the fair’s
marketing director.

He estimated the fair would wind up on
November 11 at least $100 million in debt.

Much of that total is the $55 million put
up by fair backers, plus $27.5 million in
state loans or guarantees that will come
out of the taxpayers' pockets.

“i expect the fair will owe about $35
million to creditors," said Williams.

Tougher rules sought

Albany, NY
(AP) State Attorney General Robert
Abrams will ask a federal appeals court 10
let counties set tougher voter registration
requirements for college students than for
other voters.

The attorney general is duty-bound to
defend state law and the state Constitu-
tion, which both give counties the power to
require students to show more proof of
residency than non-students, Abrams‘
spokesman Nathan Riley said Monday.

The New York Public interest Group,
which is dominated by college students.
said it will ﬁght the state request and argue
that students should be treated the same as
other voters.

Mondale ticket
at campus polls

By Tom Bergen
STAFF WRITER

Bucking the national landslide.
SUNYA students supported
Walter Mondale over Ronald
Reagan at polling places for on-
cavmpus residents. voting for
Mondale 1524 to 1100 in a large
turnout in Tuesday's election.

Patty Saikin’, a‘SUNYA stu-
dent and a. member of the
Democratic Committee in
Guilderland’s 22nd District, said
the backing for Mondale showed
"students don't go for the New
Right policies and the don’t sup-
port thc mixture of religion and
government.”

Student Association officials
estimated that 75 to 80 percent of
the 5,000 registered students turn-
ed ottt for the election. in contrast
to approximately 39 percent in
last November’s election.

Salkin said that in the 22nd
District. which is comprised ofln-
dian and parts of Dutch Quad
and votes at the Gym. 650
students voted out of 780 that
were registered.

Some problems”
found at polls;
150 turned away

By Jane Anderson
CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

With a 75 to 80 percent turnout
of SUNYA’s 5,000 newly
registered voters, Student
Association officials said Tuesday
night that overall, problems
students encountered at the
voting areas this year were
minimal.

At least 150 students, however,
were turned away from the polls,
the officials said.

in addition. between 350 and
400 students encountered
obstacles ranging from registra-
tion cards being sent to the wrong
polling place to a shortage of.
paper ballots. said Steve Gawley,
chair of SA‘s Student Action
Committee. '

Student leaders, for the most
part, said the Albany Board .of
Elections was reponsible for the
problems. while poll inspectors
said the massive voter registration
drives this fall were partly to
blame.

Students whose voter cards

in the local races, Democrats
drew the majority of votes at the
on-campus student polling places.
These include the Gym, State
Quad’s flagroom, the Thruway
House, and St. Margaret Mary’s
Church.

in the Congressional race, in-
cumbent Sam Stratton, who has
served 13 consecutive terms, was
favored by 1396 SUNYA
students, while 584 voted for
Republican challenger Frank
Wicks, and Socialist Workers
Party candidate Richard Ariza
drew only 16 votes.

in the state Assembly contest,
incumbent Democrat Richard J.
Conners was supported by 1329
on-campus SUNYA voters
whereas Republican challenger
Paul Silverstein received 549.

Joseph Frangella. Republican
candidate for the state Senate
received the most SUNYA votes
of any local Republican, garner-
ing 881 votes, which is 307 more
than his opponent, Democrat in-
cumbent Howard Nolan received.

Nolan said he felt that it was
significant that he won on campus
despite his co-sponsorship of
legislation last year to raise the
state’s drinking age to 21. “i
might have lost some votes. but 1
carried that area (the campus).”
he said.

in the race for County Court
Judge, SUNYA'voters gave in-
cumbent John Turner 972 votes,
against 416 for Republican
challenger Steven Gates.

Turner, who is the victor in the
overall race, said, “The student

vote was definitely a factor in my
election."

Democrat Anthony Cordona,
running for Family Cour't Judge,
was the choice of many SUNYA
students. drawing 1338 votes,
while his Republican opponent.
Dennis lrwin received 529.

Cordona said he believes that
student voting did affect his vic-
tory. “The kids,” he said, "were
very interested in what i was
saying."

There were two proposals to
amend the state constitution on
the ballot. The first would allow
the Legislature to set the terms of
office for sheriffs and county
clerks at tltrce or four years.

The second proposal would
allow the Legislature to increase
prize limits on certain games of

_ chance.

Voters at the Thruway House,
the Gym, and on State combined
to approved the first proposal by
499-161. but turned down the se-
cond proposal 375-407.

Off-campus student voting
results could not be determined
because those districts include a
large percentage of local
residents. in addition, the figures
for the on-campus student voting
trends do include a small percen-
tage of local resident voters.

Tuesday’s election turnout was
the cultnittation of efforts by
many campus groups, including
the New York Public interest
Research Group, the Student
Association of the State Universi-
ty, and Central Council's Student
Action Committee.

paper ballot, and swear to an af-

that district.

At some polling places, in-
cluding ones at State Quad and
the Gym, the Board of Elections
did not provide enough paper
ballots, causing students to be
turned away when supplies ran
out.

The Board of Elections “made
no preparations at all," Gav‘viey
maintained, saying that SA had
warned the Board before the elec-
tions that tnore paper ballots
would be needed.

Washington, DC.
(AP) Ronald Reagan's strength in the elec-
tion was predicted early in public opinion
polls and later validated by overwhelming
returns in his favor.

it was a somewhat different story in
Congress.

in the Senate, Democrats fought to nar-
row a 55-45 GOP majority.

Democrats counted two Senate gains; in
Tennessee, where Rep. Albert Gore cap-
tured the seat vacated by retiring
Republican leader Howard Baker, and
lowa, where Rep. Tom Harkin defeated
the Republican incumbent, Roger Jepsen.

Reagan’s coattails were evident in Ken-
tucky, where Republican Mitch McCon-
nell upset two-term incumbent Democratic
Sett. Walter Huddleston.

Nine women battled incumbents, and
they all lost.

in addition to Harkin’s victory over
Jepscn. Democrats in two other states kept
seats in the party — Lt. Gov. John Kerry
winning in Massachuscts and Gov. John
Rockefeller doing likewise in West
Virginia.

Democratic Senators winning re-election
included Sam Nttnn of Georgia; J. Bennett
Johnston of Louisiana; Joseph Biden of
Delaware: James Exon of Nebraska;
Claiborne Pcll of thode island: David
Boren of Oaklahoma: Bill Bradley in New
Jersey: Howell Heﬁin in Alabama; Max

Baucus in Montana and David Pryor in
Arkansas.

Republican incumbents Ted Stevens of
Alaska; William Armstrong of Colorado;
Mark Hatfield of Oregon; Alan Simpson
of Wyoming; Nancy Kassebaum of Kan-
sas; Strom Thurmond of South Carolina;
William Cohen of Maine; Thad Cochran
of Mississippi; Pete Domenici of New
Mexico; Larry Pressler of South Dakota;
John Warner of Virginia; Rudy Boschwitz
of Minnesota and Gordon Humphrey of
New Hampshire won new terms.

Rep. Phil Gramm of Texas kept the seat
of retiring GOP Sen. John Tower.

in the House, where Democrats hold a
266-167 edge, with two vacancies, it was
the Republicans who were looking to gain
ground. But in many states were Reagan
rolled up lopsided victories, Democratic
Congressmen were holding off GOP
challengers.

An exception was Connecticut, where
Rep, William Ratchford fell to Republican
John Rowland in a district where the presi-
dent campaigned pcrsonaliy. Helen
Bentley defeated veteran Democratic Rep.
Clarence Long itt Maryland. Long had
chaired a powerful House appropriations
subcommittee.

Other Democratic incumbents ousted in-
clttded Elliot Levitas of Georgia;. Joseph
Minish of New Jersey; Jack nghtowcr of
Texas; and Robin Britt of North Carolina.

Rep. Dan Crane of lilinois. censured by
the House for sexual misconduct with a
female page, was defeated. A second
Republican incumbent also fell, Lyle
Williams of Ohio.

Rep. Gerry Studds of Massachusetts, an
avowed homosexul who was censured for
sexual misconduct with a male page. won
Democratic re-election.

chubicans began the evening with
hopes of gaining 25 seats. Combined with
the support of conservative Democrats,
that kind ’of GOP advance would have
given the president a "working majority"
for his second-term legislation.

in the 435 House races. Democrats won
225, and led for 24, while Republicans
took 164 seats and were ahead in 21 con-
tests. lt took 218 for a majority.

The old House lineup was 266
Democrats, 167 Republicans, and two

vacancies in seats that had been held by
one Democrat and one Republican.

Republicans wrested governorships
from Democrats in four states Tuesday
and retained four other Statehouses. even
though the party‘s gains were limited to
two seats with the ouster of GOP in-
cumbents in North Dakota and
Washington.

The Republican Party could increase its
ranks among the governors from 15 to 17
seats, with Democratic representation fail-
ing from 35 to 33 statehouscs.

Republicans made the most of an oppor-
tunity presented by the retirements of
Democratic governors in North Carolina,
Rhode island. Utah and West Virginia,
winning each of those contests.

challenges by Democrats trying to grab
