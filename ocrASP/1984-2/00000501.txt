A dynamic black woman spor-
ting an all orange outfit, wearing
her hair comfortably tied back,
and describing her style as
“somewhat unorthodox," took
the stage in the Campus Center
ballroom Monday afternoon.

At 46, Lois Smith Owens told
the audience. she can usually
wake up happy with who she is.
But she said. achieving this sense
of self was a long struggle.

“I still contend," she explain-
ed. “that there is in the back of
every black person’s head one
tiny little nugget that says ‘It
would be easier if I were white’."

Although she went on to pre-
sent this point humorously, and
was met with some laughter from
the audience. many of the 65
onlookers silently nodded in
agreement.

“The acceptance of ourselves is

the most difﬁcult thing we face,"
asserted Owens, who is currently
studying for her Ph.D at Howard
University.

She urged the predominantly
black audience to take pride in
their heritage. “African people
are the originators of communica-
tion, medicine, education, and
civilization," she said.

Look proudly at the differences
between black and white people,
she told the audience. “We are
different and that’s very, very.
good." Owens declared.

Owens, speaking in honor of
Black Solidarity Day, explained
that solidarity, to-her, means uni-
ty among all black people.
regardless of their jobs or income.

“ln spite of our educational
backgrounds we still come out (of
school) as black people. We are
still looked at as black and we are
still stereotyped as black...to the
big world out there you’re just

another ‘nigger'." she asserted,
explaining why all black people
must work together to fight
discrimination.

“For black folks in America,"
she said. “if one of us is oppressv
ed. we’re all oppressed."

White people. she asserted to
loud applause, “should not come
into our communities with their
social workers and their band-
aids, they should go out into their
communities and enlighten their
people while we enlighten ours."

Drawing on her experience as a
professor at the Universities of
Michigan and Virginia, Owens of-
fered SUNYA's black student
leaders some advice. Set goals,
she said. and “find individuals
who have the resources you need.
then negotiate with the University
to get what you want.”

Owens urged black students to
take an active role in campus life.
“It behooves you to educate

Computer music to play at PAC

Switzerland and will be performing next week in

EDITORl/l l. A5515 TANT

Computers and music, two areas generally con-
sidered quite opposite, will be joined together by
SUNYA Music Professor Joel Chadabe in a concert
entitled "Music for Computer and Percussion" in
the Recital Hall of the Performing Arts Center

Thursday at 8pm.

Chadabe, who describes his music as “avante-
garde jazz and sometimes serious concert music,”
said that Thursday's concert is going to be both

“unusual” and a rare event.

The first of the four selections, which will each I
run about is tninutes, will be “Solo.” Chadabc
said he would make use of two “proximity sensitive
antennas" which would allow him to conduct the
computer with hand movements. similar to how a
conductor leads the musicians in an orchestra.

“Scenes from Stevens.” the second piece, was in~
splrcd‘ by the verses of poet Wallace Stevens,

Chrtdabe said.

The concluding numbers. “Follow Me Safely"

the first time he has played his entire ensemble in
the Albany area. He said he expects a large turnout
to see his different style of music.

“I generally Use the computer as an intelligent in-
strument," said Chadabe. He explained that he

programs the computer~ to generate music and he

then interacts with it by means of keyboards and
other devices. such as the antenna. The computer,
he explained, can compose the music as it plays it.

Chadabe said he has been involved with corn-

he explained.

puter music for six years. “It‘s interesting and a
new frontier. it’s interesting to experiment with it,"

Cltadabe said he believes this type ofmusic “is
becoming more and more normal," adding that,
“the kinds of things I'm working with now are go-
ing to be in everyonc's homes in ten years." he said.

“This concert,“ he said, “will demonstrate that

computers can be musically situated and can be us-

and “‘thytlmts" are two improvisational composi-

tions that will be accompanied by percussionist .lan

Williams.

Chadabe has recently performed in Paris and

 

cd in musically variable situations."

Tickets for the program are $l for SUNYA

students. and $2 for general admission and can be

reserved by calling 457-8606. [J

 

white students as much as it
behooves white professors to
educate you," she explained.

Stressing the imv tnce of
taking Afro-American to:
courses but chiding black students
for occassionally not talt m the
courses seriously enough, Uwcns
declared, “You don't come to it
because you’re looking for a gut
course, you come to it to flesh out
those parts of your life that are
absent."

Many black students, she said,
don’t know the history of the civil
rights movement. “Have any of

hillstruggle for bla‘Ck'prid‘e

you had your parents tell you
about what they did in the 60's?”
she asked the audience. About
half raised their hands to assert
that they had.

Owen was introduced by Vivian
Gordon, the new chair of
SUNYA's African and Afro-
American studies department.

Stressing the importance of
Black Solidarity Day, Gordon
said, “The world is not waiting
for a black college graduate. The
world is waiting for you with a
bat in its hand. and you need to
know that."

Black Solidarity Day’s history

it‘s no coincidence that Black Solidarity day, a national event. is

observed on November 5.

That‘s the birthday of Carter 0. Woodson, a scholar and historian
who in l915 helped found what is now called the Association for the
Study of Afro-American Life and History(ASALH).

For many years, Woodson‘s birthday has been set aside by black
leaders as a day to reflect on the past achievements and failures of the
civil rights and Afro-American cultural movements.

During the l960‘s, black leaders often selected November fifth as a
day to show black economic strength through community wide
boycotts of companies that failed to Llcscgregatc. in addition.
Novcmbcr fifth has sometimes been chosen as a day to celebrate the
signing of the emancipation proclanmtion, and a day to honor Wood-

son‘s achievements.

’l‘itroughoul all the different November fifth celebrations and
events, lllL‘ importance of black solidarity has remained tl constant
theme, cxplttincd Vivitut Gordon, the new chair of SUNYA‘s African
and Afro-American studies department.

Black Solidarity Day, Gordon said. evolved front the various
November fifth cvents celebrated each year. “it is a time to assess the
strengths and weaknesses of past struggles...(and) ’l‘hc necd to have
cohesive support on crucial issues," she asscrtcd.

“We have in our history,” Gordon explained. "sortie failures and
lack of ability to obtain certain goals, mostly bccnusc of a lack of

strength that comes in unity."

She stressed however, that “solidarity does not preclude diversi-
ty." Matty cultural groups have'organizations and hold events to
celebrate thcir heritage, site said, asserting "\vc (black Americans) get
silenced and lttbclcd as separatists and nationalists when we speak of
