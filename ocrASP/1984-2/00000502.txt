While disputing the contention of some
educators that the media focuses only on
bad news New York Times President Fred
Hechinger. speaking Thursday night at
Alumni House, agreed that there are
“legitimate complaints" to be made about
education coverage as a whole.

Newspapers favor stories which contain
news that is either “extraordinarily good
(or) extraordinarily bad.” he said. “The
(reader's) eye focuses on the crisis,” main-
tained Hcchinger.

“I'm sure Amtrak would want a story
on four trains arriving on time," he said,
adding that such events are not considered
important enough to be covered by the
media.

“There’s nothing wrong and there’s
everything right with the adversarial posi-
tion of the press toward any institution —
that's our function. In our society we are
watchdogs," continued Hechinger.

However, he criticized reporters who
have “adversarial positions personally
toward education, teaching and the enter-
prise as a whole.”

He said educators have “legitimate com-
plaints” concerning such reporters and
also those who cover education merely
because it's an open job or because it’s a
stepping-stone to another position.

“There is a lot really wrong with a lot of
media coverage ofv' education," said
Hechinger. “The turnover of people
covering education is greater than of any
other. area covered by a newspaper." he
added, explaining that two major
newsmagazines which once had permanent
education editors no longer have those
positions.

“The publishers and city editors of the
great mass of newspapers of the United
States think they're covering education

I when they send reporters to school board

meetings. It's like covering sports without
sending anybody to a game," he said.

He urged print and broadcast media to
send reporters to schools and to cover
specific programs within the schools,
citing the writing program for students at
P.S. 230 in Brooklyn. which was recently
featured in the Times. “That type of story
is passed up time and again.

Hechinger had particular criticisms of
the coverage of a 1983 report released by
the National Commission on Excellence in
Education. The report expressed concerns
that a “rising tide of mediocrity" afflicted
American education.

According to Hechinger by the time the
report was released it was outdated. but
the media did not report that. “The danger
is if you don‘t catch up and you report on
flaws that have already been corrected you
run the risk that the public will say ‘Wcll,
ifot‘his is a failing institution, why support
it. "

The American obsession with measure-
ment, particularly its interest in statistics

Times pres. defends media;
faults coverage of education

that measure academic performance, leads
to inferior media coverage. claimed
Hechinger, explaining that when the press
focuses on SAT scores, he said. they lg.
nore “realities” in favor of “shorthand.”

He criticized the attitude among some
administrators that “the less the public
knows about (education) the belter...You
(educators) must keep channels open all
the time...not just when you want a story
but all the time, and let the prcss deem;
when there should be a news story," ht
said.

He mentioned that it was. in l959, rim.
ing his tenure as educaion editor of the
Times that that newspaper was the lint
newspaper or TV station to obtain and
report the results of reading tests for New
York City schoolchildren. When the stores
were published “all hell broke loose," in
said. “We had violated something,” but,
he added, no one knew what had been
violated.

“In our society. (the media) are watchdogs."

Hechinger noted that the Titties was also
the first paper to print the “facts and
figures" of the admissions process for ivy
League Universities.

However, higher education has not been
harmed by the media’s greater :tcrcss toin-
formation, Hcchinger said, maintaining
that “it's good for education and it‘sgontl
for the public. To improve the perception
of education you must be more opcn about
what goes on in education."

Moreover, when an educator is pols
traycd favorably by the media there is it
SUFPTlSlnBly high amount of jcttlousy
among his. colleagues, said llccltingcr.
“The letters we tend to gel say, ‘l lc's rcttl-
ly pulled the wool over your eyes‘ 0| ‘llc’s
really not that good. ' We read into llltll cn-
vy, arid the perception of this llltttl's col-
leagues that he’s making them look lllltl,”
he explained, “This happens in Ctlllt‘llllllll
more titan in other institutions hccmm'
(education has) been on the defensive."

Hechinger. who currently writes a neck-
ly education column for the Times. said he
noticed education's “enormous impact on
the realities of the day" as a foreign cor-
respondent in WWII.

Students who are looking for a
new place to get together and
socialize between classes and
other activities now have another
alternative. The Jewish Students
Lounge, located in Campus
Center 320, is open Monday
through Friday from llam to
4pm except during Jewish and
academic holidays.

The lounge was created as a
response to a need for a place
where “Jewish students could
relax‘, learn together, and have a
good time.” It’s located in part of
the JSC-Hillel ofﬁce in the Cam-
pus Center, according to Steve
Greenbaum, chair of the Flame, a
Jewish organization on campus.

The lounge is a project of JSC-
Hillel, The Flame, and Revi-
sionist Zionist Alternative, the
three Jewish groups at SUNYA.
Also involved was Campus Com-
mision, part of the Greater

Reagan victory

<Front Page

Democratic House Speaker
Thomas I’. O'Neill of
Massachusetts said Reagan‘s vic~
tory was the result of “the
tremendous popularity of the
president of the United
St:ttcs...Wc‘vc never seen his
equal." But he said there were no
coattails and there was no man-
date for his programs
“whatsoever.”

No matter what the margin,'

Mondale told his supporters,
“I'm at peace with the knowledge
that lgavc it everything l’vc got."

“This fight didn’t end tonight.
It begins tonight,“ he said;

The president got news of his
victory in Los Angeles, where he
and his wife watched retttrns in a
Century Plaza Hotel suite equip-
ped with four television sets.

His supporters greeted him
with chants of “Four more
years," and a smiling president
said, “I think that's just-been
arranged."

"Tonight is the end of nothing.
it’s the beginning of everything,”
Reagan said.

The president insisted all day he
was superstituously avoiding
predictions, but he felt confident
enough to tell reporters he hoped
to participate in a summit with
the Soviet Union during a second
term in office. in an interview
with the Washington Post, he said
he would push again for congres‘
sionttl approval of a balanced
budget amendtncnt to the Con-
stiltttion and the right to veto in-
dividual sections of spending
bills, two tncasures he wants to
help reduce federal spending.

He also renewed his call for a
defense system in space designed
to shoot down missles.

ABC interviews showed
Reagan was the favorite among
Protestant and Catholic voters,
while Mondale was favored by
Jews. The Democrat also was
ahead among unemployed voters
and those earning less titan
$10,000 a year. The president was
running ahead among voters of
all other income brackets.

The largest popular vote in
history belonged to Lyndon
Johnson, elected with a 61.05 per-
cent of the vote in 1964. Ironical-
ly, Reagan emerged as a conser-
vative spokesman for Republican
Barry Goldwater during that earn-
paign. Ll

Albany Jewish Federation, which
helped to fund the program.

According to Hillel advisor Jay
Kellman, the ‘jewish groups at
SUNYA decided over the summer
to begin working more closely
together in serving the school’s
Jewish communtiy.

“it was felt last year...that the
(Hillel) office could be converted
into a lounge,” Kellman said.

Kellman said a Jewish students
lounge was needed because other
lounges don’t have the resources
of the new room. "The idea is
that in this lounge they’re able to
browse through and use Jewish
resource material," he added.

Using the Fireside Lounge.
which is located in the Campus
Center, as an example, Kellman
said there was no place for Jewish
literature or information in that
room. Tht. Jewish Students’
Lounge will provide the space for
the information, he said.

New Jewish lounge dra WS law student response

Since the lounge is located in
Hillel's ofﬁce. Greenbaum said,
“it was easy to open the place up.
We already had the room and
some chairs."

Kellman said that the furniture
for the lounge--a few chairs. a

' will include cookies, donuts, cof-

fee, and tea. The food is free to
patrons of the lounge.

Response to the lounge has
been slow. Some students com-
mented that they "didn't know

' about it," and one student said

“The idea is, that in this lounge
(students are) able to browse
through and use Jewish resource
material. ”

—.Ia y Kellman

 

table, a used rug, and a coffee
urn, was donated by people in the
Albany Jewish community.
Refreshments will also be
available in the lounge. Green-
baum said that Campus Commis-
sion is providing about $2 per
week for the refreshments, which

that “the only way I knew it was
through JSC—Hillel mailing to
me."

Other students have questioned
the lounge’s presence.

Although the Campus Commi-
sion's announcement state that
the lounge is “open to all

students. faculty, and administra-
tion," some students feel that the
lounge is making itself into a
place for the “elite.”

“This society is supposed to be
a melting pot to bring different

" cultures together. This could lead

to institutional segregation," said
sophmore Sheri Feinzig.

Although SUNYA student
Julie Seid said that this is “one of
the only ways to interact with
other Jewish people,” Rob
Sardegna wonders why “all the
other ethnic and religious groups
are getting along fine without _a
lounge." ‘

Sardegna said that all groups
don’t have equal oppertunities to
acquire a lounge area. “If every
group wanted to get their own
lounge there wouldn't be enough
room," he said.

The lounge is “definitely not
needed," said Sardegna._ El
