Due to the discovery of an RCA Victrola needle
in the attic of the home of Assistant Librarian Mary
Osielski, the University Archives now has a taped
recording of the late Anna E. Pierce, former
teacher and Dean of Women at the State College
for Teachers at Albany from 1886-1933. Previous-
ly, the i937 NBC interview with “Dean Annie" was
in record form, and could only be played on an ap-
propriate RCA Victrola.

The record was discovered by Karen J. Empic
and Jennifer Novosel. two' researchers from the
Special Collections Department of the University
Libraries while they were preparing an oral history
tape about the teacher's college during the depres—
sion era.

In addition to its use in Empie's and Novoscl’s
research tape. a copy was also made for users or the
Archives. According to an Archive representative,

.Pierce describes her tour of the New York NBC

studios and her association with the college on the
recording.

Black men recognized

sion Wednesday on the role of men in the Black

Day Monday which included speeches by SUNYA
administrators Dr. Carl Martin, Associate Dean,
and Dr. Frank Pogue, Vice President for Studeni

predominately white campuses followed Smith’s
speech.

Other events include a black film festival on
Thursday,and a dinner dance on Friday. A basket-
ball tournament, running throughout the week,
ends in a championship on Saturday.

ings against these students began last week.

“The turnout has been incredible.

the Thruway House polling place)

should vote in their home corti-
munities. said he was impressed
with the voting figures. He added.
“The percentage shows the stu-
