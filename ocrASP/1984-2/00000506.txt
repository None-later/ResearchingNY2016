Chapel House ministers chose SUNYA posts

By Johanna Clancy
smrr warren

While they were waiting for the
final baseball scores and peeling
apples for that night's Communi-
ty Supper a few weeks ago. Sister
Nancy Langhart and Father Jack
Molyn discussed their work-~and
explained how they requested
their ministry.

Langhart and Molyn are serv-
ing as SUNYA'S Roman Catholic
chaplains--posts they assumed at
the beginning of this academic
year after requesting the job.

“I think it is important for peo-
plc to know who chose to be here.
It gives us more of a commit-
ment,” Langhart said.

Last spring "a notice came out
announcing that the position for
Roman Catholic Campus
Minister was vacant at SUNYA.”
said Molyn. He received the posi-
tion after going through a series
of interviews. “I have been look-
ing forward to becoming 8 Cam-
pus Minister.” he said.

“It’s no secret there is a shor-
tage of priests. but as long as I
can be spared for Special Ministry
I’ll be here," promised Molyn.

Langhart said that in her order.
the Sisters of St. Francis. it has
only been possible to choose your
own placement for the past five
years.

No major shake-ups are plann—
ed. said Langhart. "We’re not
going to try and change things,
since we're both new." Langhart
explained, stating that both
Amnesty International and Peo-
ple and Food would both be con-
tinuing their work on campus. In
the past. Catholic chaplains have
served as advisors to the groups.
and Langhart and Molyn said

WEDNESDA Y. NOVEMBER 7.19841: ALBANY—STUDEN‘FFRESS’ 1E5"

 

    

LYNN DREIFUS UPS

Sister Nancy Langhart and Father Jack Molyn
Both requested to conic to SUNYA this year

they intend to follow suit.

Molyn, who has been working
with People and Food, said the
group wants to work on publiciz-
ing the problems of world hunger.

World Food Day was recently
sponsored by the group. and in-
cluded several speeches and panel
discussions which were televised
from Washington, D.C. Unfor-
tunately, not many people were
able to attend the day's events on
campus. Molyn said.

Currently, People and Food is
sponsoring a food drive. and club
members tabled all last week in
the Campus Center lobby.

Langhart said she would like to
see a branch of the international
Catholic peace organization--an
Christi established at SUNYA.

She also said she will be work-
ing with the Amnesty Interna-
tional chapter to help publicize
the plight of prisoners of cons-
cience imprisoned across the

world.

But. “I don't want to limit
myself to programs. I want to of-
fer my services in any capacity, ”
Langhart said.

Both said they are in contact
with their predecessors for
guidance and suggestions.

Onc predecessor. Father Bill
Ryan, "is administering a parish
in Little Falls, before his sab-
batical to Washington State.”
next year. Molyn said.

Sister Danielle Bonetti. who
held the job before Langhart “is
now working at Russell Sage. She
moved before I got going, but I
meet with her once in a while."
said Langhart.

“We‘re planning a November
retreat at Silver Bay near Lake
George. It is entitled Journies,"
Langhart said, adding that
another future project will be the
formation of a discussion group
on Catholic identity to meet at
Chapel House.
