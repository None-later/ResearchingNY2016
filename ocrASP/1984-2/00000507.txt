There is, Gordon said. “a re-
uirement for a kind of cultural
mnesia (among black people) in
rder to be a good American.”
Woodson spent his life trying
0 combat this attitude, according
0 Gordon. “Woodson devoted
is whole career to correcting
I isconceptions about the black
I an's past," Gordon explained.
in I926, Gordon said, Wood-
on established the second week

‘ _- February as Negro History

Week. This observance was ex-
panded in the late 1970’s when
President Jimmy Carter signed a
bill making the entire month of

I February Black Culture Month.

p In addition to founding the

organization that grew to become
the ASALH, Woodson helped in-

‘, itiaie the publication of two

magazines, The Negro History
Bulletin and the Journal OfNegro
History.

Canton, Virginia in 1875.
