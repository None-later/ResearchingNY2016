New York City
(AP) The voting might be over
but the issues remian. Little that
occurred Tuesday has had any im—
mediate impact on them, and
there continues to be a question
of whether they will be dealt with
effectively.

Among the issues are three that
directly affect each individual and
which, for reasons that few will
agree on, have persisted in spite
of promises to deal with them.

There is the issue of employ-
ment, or unemployment.

Since the onset of the economic
recovery total civilian employ-
ment has risen by 6.5 million
workers —— remarkable until it is
dissected.

Jane Norwood, commissioner
of the Burear of Labor Statistics,
points out that in spite of job
creations only 70 percent of the
manufacturing jobs lost during
the recession have been
recovered.

So, the same old jobless pro-
blctns remain. The new jobs are in
trades and services, many of
which are in areas removed
geographically from the deep
pockets of unemployment, and

Voting problems

and all of Indian Quad vote,
received IO paper ballots initially,
according to Elections Inspector
Joanne De Tltomasis.

Dc Thomasis said that at least
six people were turned away
because of a sltortagc of paper
ballots for them to vote on.

Elections and SA officials
agreed that tnany students’ voter
cards ended up at the wrong poll-
ing places.

Three hundred cards which
belonged at the polling place at
St. Margaret Mary’s Clturclt ap-
peared at the Thruway House,
Gawley said. The Board of Elec-
tions had no excuse for this, he
maintained. .

Inspectors at each of the five
main student polling places blam-
ed some of the problems on the
students and on voter registration
drives held at SUNYA earlier this
fall.

“They (the groups holding the
voter drives) registered (students)
over the summer and didn't get
their pcrtnanent addresses,” said
Tom Sullivan, Inspector of Elec-
tions at St. Vincent’s, where
Alumni Quad votes.

“Who ever was in charge of
student enrollment f--ked up."
Sullivan asserted, saying that the
63 paper ballots collected at St.
Vincents were necessary because
of the voter registration efforts.

Many inspectors and observers
at the polls attributed some of the

problems to students who didn't .

re-register to vote at their new
addresses.

Thruway House Elections In-
spector Robert Chard estimated
that close to ICC students, out of
the 1.200 registered at the
Thruway House, were forced to
vote by affidavit. Students frotn
Colonial and parts of Dutch
Quad voted at the Thruway
House.

Two or three students were
turned away from the polls at St.
Margaret Mary's, where residents
from part of Dutch Quad vote,
because they didn't re-rcgister
after moving, said Inspector Fred
(lonelier, a SUNYA student.
“It's pretty muclt their (the
students' own fault." he asserted.

many also are beyond the
qualifications Of the jobless.

In short, the economy is
creating lots of jobs but the
distribution pattern is leaving
serious social, geographic and
economic problems.

The growth of government also
remains an unresolved issue in
spite of efforts by the nation’s
most powerful citizen. President
Reagan dedicated his presidency
to the task but failed to ac-
complish it in four years.

Federal government outlays
and receipts as a percent of gross
national product — the total of
all goods and services produced
— are still growing. ln I980 the
federal government's percentage
was at a peacetime record of 22.4.

Only during World War II,
when the percentage reached-48.9
in 1944, was that level exceeded
— until the Reagan
administration.

In fiseal I981 the percentage
rose to 22.8, and then to 23.8 in
1982. [t rose again to 24.7 percent
in fiscal I983, and remained near
