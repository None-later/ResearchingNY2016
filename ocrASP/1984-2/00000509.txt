a majority of statehouses was in l969,
when the GOP had 32 of the

from Schieffelin.

“The only thing that i learned
this year was how to lose." said It
disgruntled Tygar. “I wasn't used
to losing in high school. We
didn't play with any confidence at
all. Playing next year is not a very
ltigh consideration for me. I‘m
definitely leaning away from it."

With some players considering
not to rcturtt, and with other
players graduating. Schicfl‘clin
will be looking for players to help
his tcatn.

“l‘m going to look at a few
players so that I can start thc
season with a different situa-
tion." said Schieffelin. “I‘m go-
ing to get a better nucleus; l’m go-
ing to get experienced players who
can function at a good. Division
lll level."

Recruiting freshmen and induc-
ing students to transfer from
other colleges doesn't necessarily
guarantee their being on the team.
This year. players that Schieffelin
had counted on to contribute
didn't even come out for the
team.

“I got some of these kids into
the school. and even got them
jobs.“ said Schieffelin. “They
didn't even have the common
courtesy to tell me that they
weren‘t going out for the team. 1
know that there's no guarantee
that they’ll play for us. especially
in Division III. It shows their
family upbringing. Some people
just want to come to this school
without any intentions of playing.
That's being insincere.”

Forget the record for the mo-
ment. If the team improved itself
over the season, then the year
wasn’t a total loss. According to
Duarte. the team didn't even ac-
complish that small task.

“I would say that only two
players improved this year —
Scott Cohen and Carl loos, and
that’s bad.” said Duarte. “Peo—
ple have to improve for us to do
well. I know that I didn't im-
prove. The coach should have
worked with the team and with in-
dividuals for everyone to im-
Prove. He should have been more
specific when he criticized me. In-
stead. he just said, ‘Paco. y0u're
playing sh--ty.' Overall though.
he does a good job."

According to Schieffelin.
Cohen was the most consistent
player on the field this year. it's
interesting to note that Cohen
didn't think he would be starting
his senior year.

I‘l would have liked to leave

SUNY Albany with a few tnorc
wins." said Cohctt. “Wc ttcvcr

ltnd ottc grcztt season. and l was
ltopittg that this would be it. Play-
ing soccer hear the past four years
was one of tltc only tltings that
kept me from transfcring to
another school."’
