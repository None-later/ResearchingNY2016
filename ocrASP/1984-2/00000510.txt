,. .. spears, BRIEFS

Skaters win

The season debut for the
Albany- State hockey club
could not have started any bet-
ter than it did.

In its second year of ex-
istence, the hockey club cap-

tured the first annual Albany'

State Hockey Invitational this
past weekend.

The Albany squad swept past
the Adirondack Junior Red
Wings on Friday night,7-5, and
then edged Mohawk Valley
'Community College 4-3 in
Saturday's finals.

In winning the tournament,
Albany’s special teams sparkl-
ycd, killing off it ottt of 12
power plays while converting 5
out of 12 of tlteir one-man
advantages.

“For the beginning of the
season, we looked fantastic,"
said rookie Coach Jim
Cavanaugh. “Our specialty
teams were just unbelievable."

“This is extremely gratify-
ing," said winger Patti Essncr.
“We didn‘t know how well
we‘d size up against the team.
We all just went out there and
skated as hard as we could.“

Mike Cavanaugh, the
coach's brother, keyed the
opening round over the Red
Wings by scoring a ital trick.

In that contest, Albany State
broke open 'a tie game by ex-
ploding for 5 second-period
goals and adding one more in
the third.

1n the finals, Danc’s goalie
.lim Leskody starred, turning
aside 27 Mohawk Valley shots.

After two periods, the score

stood 1-0 in Albany favor
before both teams' offenses
came alive. MVCC's Jim Yan-
du tied up the game 52 seconds
into the final session.

Bill Abrams put the Dane’s
up 2-1 minutes later, bttt Patt
Webb knotted the score mid-
way through the period.

The Danes then added two
consecutive goals--onc by Chris
Reed and the other credited to
Mike Mondicllouto lift the
Danes in the lead for good.

Albany will play the Adiron-
dack Junior Red Wings again
this week. According to of-
ficials, the game might be
played in the Glen Falls Civic
Center.

Rushing record

Albany State fttllback Dave
Soldini will attempt to break a
school rushing record that has
stood for nine years.

If the junior from Staten
Island gains 155 or more yards
in this Saturday’s game against
Marist, he will have eclipsed
the All-Time season rushing
record of 1009 yards set in 1975
by Tom DcBlois.

Scrimmage

This Saturday the women‘s
varsity basketball team will
play their annual intra-squad,
Purple-White scrimmage. This
will be one of Head Coach
Mari Warner’s last chances to
see the team before making her
ﬁnal cuts.

Admission to the scrimmage
is free and it will start at 10
a.m. at University Gym.

By Dean Chang
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR

One word can describe the season that
Albany State’s men’s soccer team had:
disappointing. .

Every player on the learn, along with
their coaches, shared that feeling. The
season started with extremely high expec-
tations, especially after the Danes first two
wins against Oswego and Manhattanvillc
in their first two games. But reality and
tougher opponents shot down any illusions
of grandeur.

SUNY rivals Plattsbttrgh and Cortland
returned Albany to earth, defeating the
Danes in relatively close matches. Albany
beat LeMoyne in their next game, putting
the Danes over the .500 mark for the last
time in the year. In fact, the LeMoyne
game marked the last time the Danes
would beat anyone in the entire year.

Three wins. Oswego, Manhattanviile,
and LeMoyne. Eleven losses. Plattsburgh,
Cortland, North Adams, Union, Potsdam,
Binghamton (twice), Oneonta, Vassar,
RPI and Stony Brook. Two ties.
Brockport and Siena. All that adds up to
one disastrous season.

There were games where the Danes

showed that they had the ability to com-
pete against some of the best soccer teams
in New York. And then there were games
where Albany managed to play down to in-
ferior opponents' levels, and lose in the
process. This inconsistency baffled
coaches and veteran players alike.

 

Motivation was uestioncd. So was ef-

t,

fort. Some players even questioned some
of Albany Head Coach Bill Schieffelin's
techniques.

“Everyone started to blame everyone
else," said Paco Duartc. “The players
would point fingers or the coach would
single one of us out. All this just develops

from havin a bad season 'I think that it’s

 

 

UPS
Even Tlhan Presblo’s slick ball control couldn't help the men’s dismal 3-9 record.

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 7, I984 C1 ALBANY STUDENT PRESS 

Men booters’season filled with disappointment  ‘

highly questionable to see if it's my at-
titude or the coaching that‘s caused us to
do so poorly."

The one thing not blamed for the Danes'
misfortunes was ability. It was Albany's
inability to manipulate their talent to pro-
duce victories that hurt them.

“We have more skill than the other
teams," said Assistant Coach Afrim
Nezaj. “We made the mistakes thinking
that we didn't have to push to win. We
never lost a game because ottr opponents
were better. It would always be because we
didn't try hard enough."

Injuries certainly didn‘t help the Danes
this year. Captain Jeff Haekctt and Paco
Duartc were hurt for most of the year.
Two-time All-SUNYAC goalie Tom Mer-
ritt missed the entire season with an in-
jured back. Pat DaCosta broke his wrist
against Oneonta. For these players, this
season was a source of frustration. For
some of their replacements, this season
was a cause of nightmares.

Howard Tygar strved as Merritt's
replacement, and did a credible job most
of the time. Tygar did nave his off days
though, as he came under some criticism

Women harriers finish a strong third in ECA Cs

By Cathy Errtg
STAFF WRITER

After having regained their confidence
and upward momentum with an im-
pressive third-place finish in the AIAW
New York State meet last week, Coach
Ron White had a training plan for the
Albany State women’s cross country team.

.Each athlete would be monitored
carefully during the daily workouts of the
week prccceding Saturday’s ECAC meet,
mentally and physically. People would be
held back if necessary to cttsure that the
team wouldn‘t peak too early.

"The ECAC is a very objective meet,"
said White. “Anything can happen. One
Mistake can alter everything; it all depends

 

upon who's up on that particular day."

By the end of the race it was apparent
that White’s strategy had paid off for the
Danes. After having finished in l4th place
in this competition last year, its outstan-
ding performance on Saturday enabled
the team to finish second, beaten only by
Ithaca College, a team White believes to be
one of the top three Division 111 teams in
the country.

The runners defeated SUNY rival Cor-
tland and also Smith College, the team
that had ruined Albany's bid for an
undefeated season. The final results of the
race were as follows: Ithaca. 47; Albany,
112; Cortland, 113; Smith, 136; Plant-
sbttrgh, 168; Binghamton, 176; South

It was, for the Danes, the biggest cross
country placing in their history. Running
on their own home course, the women all
ran the best races of their lives; “the
ltighlighl of their athletic careers," was
their coach's observation, with each corn-
petitor rtttming to a personal best time.

For the first time ever, Albany got its
first five runners, Karen Kurthy, Kim l’et~
tichord, Lynn Jacobs, Bette Dzamba. and
Donna Burnham. all in under 19 minutes,

and the spread between the ﬁrst and fifth
runners, 48 seconds, tied Albany's univer-
sity record.

The significance of that achievement is
that every member of the team has improv-
ed tremendously; the team's outstanding
finish was due to the strength of the team
as a whole, and not solely on the perfor-
mancc of one or two individuals.

The first to finish the meet for Albany
was Knrthy, whose time of 18:06.8 broke
teammate .lncobs' school record of 18:32,
and gave her an 11th place finish, proof
that site is one of the premier collegiate
runners in the Central Eastern Division III
region. Not far behind Knrthy was Pet-
tichorti. who placed 15111 with the excellent
time of 18:13. For Pettichord, it was her
first race itt under 1‘) minutcs and an im-
provement of 55 seconds o\cr her previous
best. Both Kurthy and l’cttichord received
individual awards for their performances.

Jacobs, in only her second race after
having sitting out reluctantly for nearly a
month with an injured hamstring, placed
26th with the time of 18:33. only one sc-
cond off her previous best time. That she
has returned to her prior form itt such a
short period of time demonstrates thefine
athlete that Jacobs is.

With another week of practice coming
up, she is being increasingly optimistic for
next week's Division III regional
competition. -'

Dzamba, 27th place in 18:34, and Bur~
nham. 37th, 18:54, rounded out Albany's
top five runners, both coming through
with the strong, consistent performances
they have become known for. For Bur~
nham, it was her first race in under 19
minutes. '

Albany’s remaining competitors, Rachel
tiraslow and Chris Varley, ran fine races as
\C”. Braslow, also recovering from an.in-
Vnry, run to a personal best time of 19:25,
llld Varley's time of 19:45 bettered by 14
econds her own previous best.

And now, with two consecutive suc-
ccssful invitational meets completed, the
Danes are looking to their next challenge:
the NCAA Divsion 111 Regional

White predicts an almost certain victory
for Ithaca College, a victory that would
qualify Ithaca for the NCAA Nationals.
However, two learns, and not one. qualify
for the Nationals from this meal. After
having placed second in the ECAC‘S, the
Danes can‘t help but hope of being the
other.

But there is no definite prediction at this
point. “We'll just let it happen," stated
Karen Kurthy. 1:]
