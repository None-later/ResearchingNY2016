Tucker's impression of' the

(COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE) The teenage cocaine ex-

Cocaine —- once labeled the drug of the rich — is
now becoming so popular on campuses around the
country that researchers call its rapid growth the na-
tion's number-one substance abuse program. “Ob-
viously, cocaine use is growing on campuses," said
Dr. Ronald Linder. UCLA health science professor
“And the problem is getting worse.”

“There didn't used to be any problems with,

Though few studies are done on college cocaine
abuse, Jones believes the inﬂux of cocaine abuse
patients at his off-campus clinic probably reflects
an increase among college-age abusers similar to the
national averages. "Four years ago, there were
none (cocaine abusers). Now l2 percent to 13 per-
cent of otir patients have cocaine problems," he

John Murphy, Assistant Direc-
tor of Residential Life for
Judicial Affairs, said, "What i
have noticed in the last couple of
years is a substantial increase in
the area of assaults and fights,
and in the majority of these in-
cidents alcohol is involved."

Murphy cited figures showing
that in the Fall Semester of 1983,
alcohol was involved in 76 percent
of all fights and assaults reported
to him as well as 78 percent of the
damages to furniture. and 38 per-
cent of all incidents involving
harassment.

Murphy’s office has recently
begun administering ques-
tionaires to students who are
referred to the office on
disciplinary matters and are
believed to have a drug or alcohol
problem. Depending on . the
results of the questionaire, Mur-
phy said, a student may be refer-
red to the Middle Earth Counsel-
ing Center.

Director of Middle Earth,
David Jenkins, said that in many
cases problems that students br-
ing to Middle Earth are the result
of drug or alcohol use “which is

'Mark'Gesner, a student phone
counselor at Middle Earth added,
“in our services we're seeing some

According to Gesner. Middle
Earth has been experiencing a
dramatic increase in the use of its
services in the last several years,
including a 250 percent increase in
contacts regarding drug and
alcohol abuse from I981 to I98],
_ Gesner attributed the increase
in use of Middle Earili services to
greater awareness of Middle
Earth programs. in addition, he
said, more people are viewing

lsraeli speakercalls for deportation of all Arabs

By Pamela Schusterman'
While protesters outside
SUNYA’s Performing Arts
Center were chanting “lsrael out
of Lebanon now" and “Long live
PLO -— down with Zionism,"

Rabbi Meir Kahanc was inside the .

l
i
i PAC calling Arabs "cancer
I within the state of Israel" and ad-
i‘ vocating the deportation af all
, Arabs from that country.
:, Kahanc, founder of the Jewish
‘ Defense League and member of
f the Israeli Parliament, is a con-
' troversial figure due to his ad-
vocacy of violence and
r discrimination in regard to Arabs
f in lsrael. His speech was spon-
r sored by SUNYA'S Revisionist
; Zionist Altcrnative(RZA).
t Kahane appealed to American
‘ Jews to stand up and fight for
3 Jews living in the Soviet Union,
. where, he said, the atmosphere is
' “charged with hatred toward
i Jews.”
3 "Arabs," he said, “are cancer
x within the state of Israel." The
Arab population will soon out-
number the Jewish population,
Kahanc said. In order for Israel to
be a Jewish state there must be a
majority of Jews, he asserted,
declaring that he does not plan to
lose his country to “bullets or
babies.”

Kahanc advocated deporting all
Arabs from lsrael. “They have
twenty countries, I have one,” he
said.

“Any Arab not ready to leave
will go by trucks to their brothers

all i care," Kahane declared.

“For Jews, Jewish problems
come first because no one else will
help us, we saw this in World War
II and it could happen again,"
asserted the Jewish Defense
League founder.

When asked how he feels about
being called a racist Kahanc
answered “call me names but that
does not change the problem."

Kahanc said he believes that
Jews are losin lsrael, both

    

   

spiritually and physically. He said
he will not let this happen.
Closing his speech, Kahane ap-
pealed to the Jewish population,
“Come home to Israel, raise your
children there, there is no future
here, get married, have a lot of
babies, come home, come

in response to Kahane‘s
speech, Gady Buiumsohn, Presi-
dent of RZA said, “We don’t
support Rabbi Kalianes’ view but

we believe he has a right to speak
and that he has a great effect on
American Jews and Jewish youth.
A great deal of what he says is
very true about American Jewry
and people must listen.”

John Flanders, a member of
the Socialist Workers party and a
protester, said. “I think that what
he (Kahanc) represents is a form
of racism and fascism and he calls
for expulsion of all Arabs from
Israel." Flanders added, "He

‘ calls for an expulsion like Hitler
tried to impose in Germany."

Another protester, Maria
Muscareiia, said. “it is sickening
that students are paying for this. I

,know very well if S.A. tried to
"fund the Ku Klux Klan there

would be an uproar from the
Jewish, Black and total popula-
tion on campus. Student money
should not be used to propose
racist views," RZA, is not, in
fact,.an S.A. funded group.

Kahane also received positive
support from many Albany
students.

Paul Aronoff. a freshman,
said, “He is not projecting
violence. He doesn't want
violence or death. He is not ad-
vocating that. He is trying to pro-
tect Israel from being taken over

'by the Arabs."

Melissa Rosenfeld, also a
freshman, said. “I think it's great
that he is on campus. The pro-
testers are wrong."

Steve Smith, a senior, said, “i
think regardless of his opinion,
either way he has a right to pre-
sent his views. people like Kahane
that aren’t in the mainstream
should be able to express views
because that is the basis of
American democracy."
Buiumsohn said, “The Jews need
to listen and those who care at all
should listen to him. Jews that
refuse to face issues, regarding
anti-semitism, assimilation and
the possibility of another
holocaust are the real disgrace.”

Determined dancers raise $6, 000

By Christopher Bloqulst
EDITORIAL ASSISTANT _

Dancing bodies, bruised and blistercd feet, and sweat, helped raise approximately
$6,000 for Telethon '85's 24-hour Dance Marathon held Friday night, according to Eric
Dorf, Co-Chair of Telethon '85.

Dorf said, “I think it went very well" and praised all who were involved in the event;
including dancers, sponsors, DJ’s, VJ’s, and staff. He said “47 couples or so" par-
ticipated, half of which danced the entire 24-hour period.

Although there were about three couples fewer participating this year than last, Dorf
said they outdid last year's dancers in enthusiasm and energy, and kept up with them
financially by raiding about the same amount of money.

“A lot more dancers lasted this year than last year" he stated, noting that by the end
of the marathon almost half the couples were still dancing. No couple was required to
dance the full 24 hours.

According to Dorf, approximately 80 percent of last year's sponsors’ pledges came in,
a figure he expects to match, or improve, this year. “We had a lot of large pledges," he
said, “and we're offering some great prizes." In order to claim thier prize, couples have
to collect and turn in their pledged dollars. Prizes offered included a television, tickets to
WCDB's Rock Night, and an album from SUNYtunes.

The marathon, held in the Campus Center Ballroom, began with a four hour video
Show provided by Party Master Videos. “They did a great show" complimented Dorf
who said that because the videos opened the marathon, the dancers were "far more
energetic" during this portion of the event.

After the videos ended, Dorf said WCDB DJ '5 took over and provided “upbeat music
that kept the dancers going into the morning hours." Participating DJ's included ilan
Nissan. Adam Fass, Miranda Alfonso, and Phil Chonigman, said Dorf.

Last year's marathon ws the first one where gay and lesbian couples entered. Dorf said
he wasn’t sureif any homosexual couples entered this year. "I don't know of any, but if
they did, no one thought anything of it." He was angered that gay participation last year
was made such a big issue. "lfeveryone is dancing and having a good time and a gay cou-
ple Wants to join in, then fine. Why make an issue of it?" he asserted.

WCDB network faced many
snags in covering elections

By Robert Hanlon
STAFF WRITER

While it may not have run as smoothly
as President Reagan's reelection carn-
paign, WCDB's Election Night College
Network (ENCN) was “overall, it very
good success," according to WCDB News
Director Phil Choriigman.

ENCN was a nationwide college radio
station network set up by SUNYA’s radio
station WCDB-9IFM to provide student
oriented coverage of the elections.

According to a statement from Marc
Groriich, coordinator of the ENCN, 39
college campus radio stations in 25 states
were scheduled to telephone in reports on
their state gubernatorial, senatorial, con-
gressional, and presidential balloting, as
well as on various state propositions and
constitutional amendments.

However, the statement continues, “l3
never called, ll called only once, 12 sta-
tions called twice leaving more than one
report, and only three stations called three
times." A total of 80 reports were filed
throughout the evening's coverage, which
ran from 8:30 pm. to 3:00 a.m., according
to Gronieh.

The calls were taken in the Student
Association ofﬁces in the Campus Center.

Speculating as to why l3 stations did not
call in, Chonigman said, “There could be
several reasons," including technical pro-
blems at some of the stations, a mix-up in
communications between WCDB and the
other stations. and “an enthusiastic ‘yes'
from the general manager, but not from
the news director" of as particular station.

Tim Wallace, WCDB's “floor

manager" for the evening, and the student
responsible for the arrangements between
the various affiliates. said that some of tiie
stations may have failed to call “because
we didn’t start 'til 9:00. and they figured
nobody would be interested" since the
had already been

presidential contest

decided.

 

 

Defending the decision of signing-on
after the major television networks had
already projceeted a presidential winner,
Chonigman said that the station “refused
to go on before New York State polls clos-
ed. We didn't want to have any inﬂuence"
on the outcome of local balloliiig.
“Nothing is gained by going Oil that car-
ly," he added, “it is the responsibility of
the tncdia not to do those things. That's
our opinion."

Another problem ENCN faced was the
failure of one of the cassettes used to col-
lcct reports phoned in by affiliates. “The
equipment on one of the photie lines broke
down during the first hour of network
operation, but our technician was right
there fixing it immediately. The machine
was down for about 25 minutes," accor-
ding to Gronieh.

Chonigman said that “one of the casset-
tes from the ECC(Educational Com-
munications Center) failed." One of the
four ECC cassettes did not work at all
from the beginning of the evening, and
then another failed in the first hour, he
Said. “We were left with one recorder
short for our phone lines," until it was
repaired he added.

“Every report brought in on that
recorder was just garbled mess," Wallace
said.

Despite problems which can plague all
group operations, Wallace said, the ENCN
achieved a substasntial amount of success
compared with a similiar effort four years'
ago.

According to Wallace. a check on the
election night efforts in 1980 showed that
15 stations participated that year including
the stations that didn't call. “We doubled
the effort from 1980," sasid Wallace.
Chonigman added that the network “was
larger than 1980 — and the landslide was
bigger, too.”

There was a strategy to the network
beyond coverage of the presidential con-
