Curtis claims-news media distorts: Irish conflict

By Christine Reitelt
suns wturstt

Addressing a crowd of about 50
people Tuesday, November 6,
author Liz Curtis spoke forcefully
about the British media's ap-
proach to northern Ireland.

“Anti-Irish sentiment in
England is widespread," Curtis
said. due largely to what she term-
ed “Media distortion"

The British Government “cen-
sors without seeming to censor"
all events in Northern Ireland, she
charged.

British troops have occupied
Northern Ireland. which is under
British rule. to stop Catholic-
Protestant riots which had broken
out.

Since that time. many civilians,
a majority of which have been
Catholics. have died at the hands
of police. riot forces. and British
soldiers. For several years Britain
also itnprisoned but never charg-
ed men and women suspected of
pro Irish Republican Army (IRA)
activities. The IRA is leading the
civil war against the British.

“The British journalists are
biased" Curtis stressed. adding
that they “sell their biased views
to the United—States and other
countries." British stringers and
free-lance journalists are largely
loyalists to the British Govern-
ment and they all cover the situa-
tion in Ireland. printing“only
what they want to print" Curtis
said.

Explaining that U.S. news
reports come largely from English
sources. Curtis said that
American reporters write up the
event “the Way the British news
agency said it happened.”

U.S. readers tend to“get news
from only the biased British point
of view." or else only through
special broadcasts. such as To Die
for lrelandwhich aired in the U.S.
last year after an IRA hunger
strike. An American crew was
sent to research material
themselves.

Only on these infrequent occa-
sions does “the U.S. get their
own point of view on issues." she
asserted.

British television coverage dif-
fers substantially from American
coverage. she said. The word
“guerilla” used to describe a
member of the IRA. would be
“inconceivable in Great Bri-
tain...Such words do not etht In
Media there" Curtis said.

English citizens are taught
practically nothing about the
situation in Ireland. Curtis said.

As far as the British educators
are concerned. Ireland simply
doesn’t exist" she maintained.

The viewers are uneducated
about Irish politics, and thus
"believe only what they want to
believe." she said. British Media
has a “virtual monopoly in in-
fluencing what people believe"
she added.

coverage on northern Ireland,
Curtis had much to say. “Almost
all British newspapers support
direct British rule under (British
Prime Minister Margaret) That-
cher" Curtis said. and thus all
reports sway towards to govern-
tnent position. which does not ad-

Ireland.

When Irish unrest was aired on
public television, there was “an
outcry from the establishment"
Curtis said. The Government then
made certain that little violence or
bombings were shown on televi-

 

sion. she said.

All times of crisis in northern
Ireland are carefully monitored
and controlled by “the Establish-
ment.” as well, Curtis said, call~
ing it “quite an undemocratic
media."

The Government plays a very
inﬂuential role in “what gets air
time and what doesn't" she said.

Only journalists with cslablish~
ed positions get to cover major
controversial issues in Great ’Bri-
tain. Curtis said. adding that till:
Government is “so in-
timidating," most controversy
never surfaces.

Out of every 20 events which
should be covered regarding the
situation in Ireland, she said,
“only one actually gets produced
and aired."

It is much easier for the tnujot'i-
ty of English journalists to gin
up on Irish coverage. she stint-d
Those journalists who dcl') lllt
system “often find themselves out
of work" Curtis charged.

“The British Press have no
pretentions at getting to the
truth” in northern Ireland. Curtix
stressed. The press reports
whatever it sees fit. she said, so
that the public gets a distorted
view of the situation, both in
America and in Great Britain.

Ferraro's campaign seen
as women ’s breakthrough

Washington, D. C.
(AP) Although Geraldine Ferraro
didn’t triumph this past Election
Day, many political observers say
the promise her vice presidential
candidacy held for American
women hasn't died.

Her campaign represented to
many ovscrvers not just a
breakthrough for women it
politics, but for all wotncn, of all
ages. races and politica'
persuasions.

“This is irreversible progress."
said Jttgy Goldsmith. president of
the National Organization for
Women, which made a strong
push for Mondale to choose a
woman rttnning mate. “The door
is open and can't be closed
again.

Women see Ms. Ferraro as a
catalyst for increased political
power, said Kathy Wilson, a
Republican and president of the
National Women‘s Political
Caucus. which endorsed
Mondale.

"Up until Ferraro was on the
ticket, raising the consciousness
for women candidates was a state-
by-state enterprise." she said.
“What Ferraro's candidacy does
is speed up the process by 10
years."

Ann Richards. state treasurer
in Texas, said that besides helping
the Democratic Party raise money
and organize women never in-
volved in politics before. Ms. Fer-
raro‘s candidacy has given
women a new sense of
involvement.

“There's no measurement tool
to show how the Gerry Ferraros
and astronaut Sally Ride will
directly affect women," Richards
said. “And I've been delighted
with the enthusiasm with which
many men have greeted her can-
didacy. They Want her to speak at

their Rotary Clubs."

“And that men have said she is
an asset has made a lot of dif—
ference in the relationship of men
and women in politics. It's been at
working relationship and not
adversarial." Richards added.

"She is a bellwct her for
women. and being a bclhxcthei
doesn't mean having it easy,"
said Ohio Gov. Richard (‘clclsttu

“It‘s a shamefttl situation that
the question could be raised
whether a woman could be cont-

a telephone interview. “I think by
her conduct in this campaign. she
has more than answered that
question."

Others said they think it was
important that the first woman to
run on a tnajor party ticket was a
working woman with a husband
and children, and not a for-
midable figure with whom few
women can identify.

Grad employees must work as one
to get fair salaries, benefits for all

By John Crawford

A few graduate employees
(graduate assistants. teaching
assistants and research assistants
—- GA’s, TA’s. RA’s). expressed
doubt about the appropriateness
of organizing for Iiveable salaries,
adequate health coverage and a
voice in their

c a m p u s
workplace. The
They feel Graduate
satisfied with
their’stipend' Advocale

and can not see

how the Graduate Student
Employees Union (GSEU) can
help them. Most of all, they
don’t wish to be part of an
organization on campus that will
rudely keep asking. in the words
of Samual Gompers. for ‘More.
more, more.‘

A unionist would quickly
answer that without a contract
there is no guarantee that GA,
TA. RA's will be worked for less,
less, less — no matter how
brilliant their individual
scholastic endeavors. But
organized. GA, TA, RA's can re-
tain what they have and bargain
with their employer for tnore
reasonable benefits to match their
significant cducntlonul services to
SUNY

Still, there are other activities
the GSEU can perform that will
make an adequate situation much
better. Robert Benzhly, the New
Yorker wit. once said (paraphras-
ing), 'if you do not go to college
classes between l0:00AM and

 

2:00 pm. then you have forgotten
the reason why you are going to
college.’ Bencth meant that col-
lege was to provide a person with
a better life - a good living and an

‘unharried View of the world.

What better way to acquire these
characteristics than at the point of
provisioning them. in college.

Similarly. the GSEU is getting
ready to create a provisioning en-
vironment at Albany. The GSEU
can create a collegial environment
and promote the scholastic in-
terests and excellence of its
members while still graduate
employees in SUNY.The union
can work for the intellectual pur-'
suits and social support of
GA,TA,RAs at Albany.

The following are suggestions
toward this goal from Albany
grads:

The GSEU is the only campus
wlde graduate organization,
therefore it is able to imploy its
network for the social beneﬁts of
graduate students as well as GA,
TA, RA's: departmental parties.
inter-departmental meetings and
parties. campus—wide parties and
SUNY wide celebrations. It is evi-
dent to all Albany graduate
students — not just GA, TA.
RA‘S — that just one campus par-
ty for grads is a quantum jump in
raising their quality of life on
campus.

Meanwhile. the GSEU can use
these organizing skills to promote
the scholastic excellence of its
members throughout the state.
The union can help sponsor:

inter-departmental or SUNY wide
coloquiutns. conferences, exhibits
and festivals. All arranged
around its members academic in-
terests and cultural pursuits. And
these activities can be recorded in
newsletters or journals produced
and edited by graduate employees
and other graduate students.

At Albany the union can help
to build a support structure for
the everyday needs of graduate
employees: a credit union for
GA,TA,RAs; a workplace survey
to record the concerns of grads;
daycare; care for children over 5
during work hours; money saver
newsletters: workshops for
teacher training, counseling, and
research; conducting our own
refereed grants—to—graduates
program.

In other words. we can do for
ourselves what others will not
lend their time and energy to do
for us, or just can't do for us. We
can create our own collegial and
scholastic environment. We can
go beyond the coping and surviv-
ing desert that currently exists at
Albany. and flower into an in-
ter—disciplinary state-wide
harvest of interests and
motivations.

The GSEU is thinking beyond
the Gompers refrain of more,
more, more. Rather, the union
promotes .1 style of the late
labor leader John L. Lewis who
said.“Hc who tooteth his own
horn. thereby insures that it shall
beto'oted." Cl

The American Cancer Society
and SUNYA’s Tau Kappa Ep-
silontTKE) fraternity will 'be
working together to make air.
ashtrays. and lungs cleaner in this
this Thursday's annual Great
American Smokeout.

Several activities are planned
for the smokeout. a day where
smokers “kick the habit" for at
least 24 hours. possibly giving
themselves the motivation to quit
permanently.

According to TKE President
Barry Pollack. smokers can
either hand in a pack of cigaret-
tes of fill out a form that would
put themselves up for “adop’
tion" in the “Adopt A Smoker"
campaign.

In this program, a nonsmoker
“adopts” a smoker, in order to
give smokers encouragement in
the smokeout. Encouragement.
Pollack said, such as gum or can-
dy dttring a nicotine fit.

Pollack said that all who sign
up will receive free rafﬂe tickets
for prizes donated by
SUNYtunes. Barnes and Noble
bookstore. and the Dutchess
Restaurant.

He said that TKE will have
tables set up in the Campus
Center lobby on Wednesday and
Thursday to accept forms and
cigarette packs. He added, they
expect to receive more fornts that
cigarettes. The ones they do
receive however, are expected to
be buried. “One person suggested
that we burn them. but that
would smell too much,“ Pollack
said.

“I hope it(thc smokeout) will
be a success." stated Pollack. He
said that he didn’t want smokers
to feel deeply pressttrcd to quit.
“I would not want every smoker
against us. We would like to get
people to quit. It’s certainly a

health risk. But I have nothing
personally against smokers." he
said. '
“‘If they can give it up for a
day. they may reallze’it’s worth
their time," he added.

Pollack said TKE got involved
with the smokeout because,
“community service is supposed
to be a part of fraternity life.” He
explained that Student Associa-
tion gave them the idea to pro-
mote the smokeout. '

He said he hopes that par-
ticipaton in the event will increase
the social fraternity's popularity
and “make it a bigger part of
campus life."

Nationally. the 8th Annual
Smokeout will be "celebrated"
with parades. marathons. and
contests in shopping malls and
downtown areas. Common prizes
will be frozen Thanksgiving
turkeys to remind smokers that
quiting “cold turkey". can
sometimes be the most effective
method.

Other offerings will include
hotlines with advice from
psychiatrists and celebrities and
anti-smoking variety shows on
PBS.

According to the American
Cancer Society, more than one
out of every three U.S. smokers
(35.6 percent) participated in last
year's smokeout. 8.l percent did
not smoke at all on the day and
4.l percent reported that they
were still not smoking up to II
days later.

Cigarette smoking, which has
been determined to cause lung
cancer, is the number one cause
of death frotn cancer for men in
the United States. Smoking has
also been connected with cancer
of the mouth, esophagus. larynx.
pharynx. bladder. kidney. pan-
creas. and has been implicated in
cervical cancer. ‘
