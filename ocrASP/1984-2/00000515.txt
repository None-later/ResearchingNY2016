McCann elected vice chair;
‘nuclear free zone’, passed

By Leslie Chalt
STAFF WRITER

Colonial Quad representative Bill Me-
Cann was elected vice-chair of Central
Council Wednesday evening after ﬁve
hours of debate, and numerous votes that
occurred over a two week span. .

Council also approved a motion calling
for SUNYA to be a
“nuclear free zone."

The vice chair elections central
were tabled a week ago counci'
after Council spent four
hours debating various can-
didates and no candidate received the
necessary two-thirds of council’s support
to be elected.

Former Council Vice Chair Sal
Peredona resigned several weeks ago.

At this past meeting. McCann. who rar.
for SA president last spring. opposed
Elizabeth Chesnut and Amy Koreen for
the vice chair position. According to
Council Chair Mitch Feig, McCann had
wanted to run at the original meeting. but
couldn't attend because of illness. “Since
no one ws elected. he (McCann) decided to
run this week," Feig said.

According to Feig. Koreen seemed. at
ﬁrst. to have the necessary votes, but “It
wasn't getting anywhere...everyone ws be-
ing nominated. but no one ws getting
thenecessary two thirds vote."

Koreen withdrew from the race after she
admitted she was considering spending
next semester studying in Israel. Feig said.

Chesnut and McCann were asked to
leave the room so that members could
discuss the two candidates. Members had
to decide. Feig said. who they thought
would be better as vice chair. not who they
thought would win.

After a second vote was taken Chesnut,
withdrew and McCann was elected. Com-
menting on his election McCann said.
“it‘s great. We needed a vice chair. and
now we can get down to business."

McCann said he wants more stident

participation; explaining. “i think we need
more people involved, and to get regular
students involved." He also said he wants
to work with lnterquad Council.

The Nuclear Free Zone Resolution,
which Council passed. called for SUNYA
to become a location which would deal on.
ly with nuclear research that doesn't con.
cern nuclear weaponry. according to
Feig. who said he ws in favor of the
resolution.

Council's Student Action Committee
(SAC) introduced the resolution, SAC
Chair Steve G'awley said he thought it was
a necessary step.

Gawly added that the university should
“leave open the area of nuclear research.
because it is going on all over the world."

But. he said. "We've constructed things
without knowing how to kep them safe.
Right now, nuclear power isn't sale."

The resolution is only a recommenda-
tion being sent to members of the SUNYA
administration for them to consider. No
action can be taken at this time because
research facilities are not within SA's
jurisdiction.

Steve Russo. Chair of Council's Internal
Affairs committee. said he opposed the
resolution. “We have to be aware of ab
solutes. i don't like the idea of a nuclear
free zone. Research is necessary to certain
extents."

Council also voted to increase stipends
to SUNYtunes managers became the
record coop was highly SllCCC\\ltll last
year.

According to Feig, “By increanng their
stipends. (regular) stipend policy was
broken. A stipend policy is not allotted to
be broken in the middle of the your. and a
two-thirds vote was required." (curtail
member Steve Landis said the mic Wet» a
bad precedent for increasing or dctlcming
stipends in the middle ofthe year. -\ rinsi-
ble occurrence might be the loucrittg of the
stipend of any elected official it' lie docs ll

the membership fee of the already hun-
dred strong club is three dolltm per
