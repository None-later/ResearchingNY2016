he University is offering a new degree
Humanistic Studies that’s a doctorate
t isn't a doctorate — or at least it‘s the
osite of a convential degree.

! rench Department Chair Martin
nes, who guided the new program
ough ﬁve years of review, said the cm-
asis of the doctorate is “to produce
eralists and comparativists — inter-
ciplinary people whose interest is to
radon out and ﬁnd connections between
Ids."

It is the reverse. he said. of a Ph.D
ausc “a Ph.D program is designed to
in a person to do advanced research and
ching in a precisely designed ﬁeld."
Kanes said that the program will appeal
those seeking employment in govern-
nt, at museums, as well as in the private
tor.. ‘

“it's a tough program." Kanes
. rted. saying that participants need “a
illingness to move around
tellectually."

rolled in the program are diverse in their
ofessions. interests and geographical
ckgrounds, but that all share an
'ntellectual curiousity. We have a high-
wered group of people." He said that
me people have B.A. degrees. others
so have M.A. degrees and that some
‘ ve done graduate work.
, Most of the candidates are already
played and looking to either advance or
angc their careers, he said. "Some have
- iﬁc career plans," Kanes explained,
while others want to enhance their ability
I usefulness to do their jobs."
The Doctorate in Humanistic Studies in-
rporates existing graduate level courses
' to its program Kanes said. adding that
e Humanities doctorate program has in
fact "rearranged pieces into a new
ttern."
The only addition. Kanes said, is a set of
Iloquia which will serve as the core for
to new program. Professor Beret Lang. a
w faculty member. will be teaching the
lloquia.
Kanes explained that the colloquia are
. a broad ranging design to bring the ﬁelds
gether and bring people together” and to
d to the discussions the varying perspec-
ves of a topic.
. The set of humanities colloquia will con-
rn the history and nature of humanities.
his semester's colloquia topic is “Sym-
Is and Symbol Systems." Kancs said.
hich involves the theory of symbols and
acing the notion of symbols as sets.
Kanes also said that Lang is currently

he author is a physician in Albany.
Discussing the need for new means of in-
oducing drugs into the human body, Dr.
obert Longer. a professor of Chemical
nginccring at M.I.T. said in a campus
each that previous methods have been
‘ bject to too many variables within the
uman body.
Langer spoke Sunday. November 4th at
e international Tea. sponsored by SUNY
omen’s International Committee on
New Methods of Drug Delivery."
In the past, Langer said. variations in
rug release were approached by produc-
‘ 8 complexes. coatings, suspensions.
- mulsions and compressed tablets. Unfor-
natcly. these preparations are subject to
any local environmental variants.
‘ Langer indicated that there is a great
eed for controlled and uniform release of
rugs. not subject to ph variation and
ther local factors in the human body.
Two basic systems of drug release in-
ude polymers and pumps for small. low
olccular weight drugs. Langer outlined

Kanes said that students who have

organizing a Humanities institute that will
eventually form a link with the DA.
program.

Candidates who are accepted into the
program are required to take courses in
two fields. The student can decide to study
in either two Humanities related ﬁelds or a
single Humanities ﬁeld with an outside
field as the second choice.

The Committee on Humanities must ap-
prove of students' choices of ﬁelds.

According to Kanes. the two ﬁelds that
each candidate selects are an equivalent of
a major and a minor, and each student
takes graduate courses like students in any
other discipline. .

Current humanities doctorate can-
didates include one person from Brazil and
one from Oregon. which Kancs said is an
indication that interest in the program has
come from across the U.S . and other coun-
tries as well.

During the development of the program.
which received ﬁnal approval from Gover-
nor Mario Cuomo in August. Kanes said
he examined other interdisciplinary pro-
grams at schools around the country. but
said he found that most of them were ac-
tually based on traditional Ph.D
programs.

“Ideally.” he said. “a person will come
out of this program with the knowledge.
skills, technique. and modes of thought on
one ﬁeld and be able to apply them to
another." along with the ability to apply
humanistic values.

Margaret Gray. 3 candidate enrolled in
the program. is currently on a one-year
leave from her teaching job in Rotterdam,
New York. in order to pursue her work for
the degree.

Gray explained that she has always
wanted to get her doctorate and has chosen
for her two ﬁelds theater and education

with plans to either teach at the college'

level or join the New York State Council
for the Arts. ’

“I fch l have a lot to offer." she said.
referring to the experience she has gained
over the years. She added that she saw the
humanities doctorate as an opportunity
for self-improvement and advancement to
a better position.

To be admitted to the program, which
seeks to show candidates how to carry the
perspectives of one discipline into another.
applicants must have participated in
previous undergraduate or graduate work.

Applicants must also demonstrate proﬁ-
ciency in a foreign language. and will be
expected to complete a one semester in-
ternship in an area related to their career
plans before receiving their degree.

nausea from chemotherapy treatments for
cancer patients. Most of the polymers are
patches on the skin. while the pumps are
implanted.

Longer has also developed delivery
systems of ploymcrs for large molecular
chemicals such as proteins and peptides,
including insulin and growth hormones.

which generally have very short shelf lives. , _

These. he said, are uniquely designed
polymers made of natural products such as
amino acids and fats. Many of these
polymers are biodegradable. as well. he
said.

The shape of the polymer has been
calculated to produce a continuous
uniform level of delivery. said Lunger.
Materials such as polyanhydrides were
first used in clothing 40 years ago, but they
were abandoned and were never used In
biomedical systems.

Supplemental releases for added drug
delivery needs were accomplished. he said.

Albany Boys Club and Drakeland Daycare

Delaware Avenue in downtown Albany.

an alternate activity to living in the street"
explained Dorf. The club provides both
athletic and educational programs to

are “9,000 fewer.SUNY students in the

With fewer students now in the SUNY
system. Ramaley outlined two possible
outcomes. The university could either cut
staff because “we don't have to teach as
many students" or use the opportunity to
restore a more favorable ratio of faculty to

students."

The Message added. however. that “this

The center charges for its services but on

Dorf said that the Boys club will receive
60 percent of the funds raised by Telethon.
with the remaining 40 percent going to the
daycare center. He hinted that another
charity might be included in Telethon ’85.
but refused to name it “until everything is
