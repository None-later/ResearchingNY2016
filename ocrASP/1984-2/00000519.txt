PJ. Proudhon. Ellinwood said.

One of the main facets of Hoffman’s
life was his deep concern for peace and
non-violence. said Donald Him, a SUNYA
History Professor and close friend of Hof-
fman's. “1 can remember in the 60's he
was involved in teach-ins to stop the war,"

' ' . “He co-taught some courses

the peace studies program that once ex-
istcd at SUNYA."

Brin descibed Hoffman as the most
“thoughtful. considerate. and kindest"
person he knew.

“He was always going out of his way to
take care of people," said Erin. “and he
extended this caring to the students.”

A former student of Hoffman’s. Maria
Briganti. said that she enjoyed his class

’ V Trials in History because "there was so

much individual attention given. He knew
your name and he was fair." said Briganti.
“He was very intelligent and had a lot to

Cocaine use

chart a rapid rise in coke use among col-
lege bound seniors from 1976 to 1981.
“Colleges may be reaping the casualties of
this period of increased incidence,"
Johnston said. “There's a lag time bet-
ween when people become involved in

,‘ coke and when they get in trouble and

wind up in a clinic. Follow-up studies show
coke use continues to rise after high
school."

“It’s a recreational drug." said UC-

‘.'. Davis' Jones. “There’s a casual attitude

about it. Students use it to study instead of

' amphetamines. ’ ’

Once thought harmless. cocaine is a
strong reinforcing agent. drawing people
to pursue its effects. Jones added. Alottg
with its euphoric high, cocaine users cx-
pericnce paranoia and irritability. often
feel depressed. socially isolated and unable
to deal with stress and pressure.
Physiological effects can include high
blood pressure. convulsions, and eye and

' . nasal problems.

At UCLA. coke abuse ranks just behind
alcohol and marijuana use. said Bonnie
Leibowitz. UCLA health educator. “LA is
the hub of drug use in the nation and
UCLA is in the center of that," she ex-
plained. “Our students are from fairly
well-off families. The cost of the drug is
not so prohibitive for them."

"The New York City price ofcoke drop-
ped 50 percent last year," said Dr. Arnold

M- Washton. research director for

BOO/COCAINE National Hotline. “One
gram of coke costs $60 to $70. it’s cheaper
than an ounce of grass.”

“The expense is getting easier for
(students) to handle in this community,"
said Duke Engei of independence Center.

1951. said Chonigman. “Most of the
members (of the ENCN) were in the Nor-

' theast," he said, adding. "better than one-

Ihird were." He explained that ENCN
“wanted 'to be sure the major contests
were covered.” as far as gubernatorial,
senatorial. and congressional contests were
concerned. “We had affiliates in North
Carolina. Tennessee, Illinois. lowa, Texas.
and Michigan" to cover the expected closc

.‘ senatorial elections Chonigman said.

The network wanted to cover the Senate

. races. as well, he said, “so the network

Wouldn't fall apart after the presidential

 contest was decided."

There were 40 to 50 participants
assisting at SUNYA. including workers in
the SA office. WCDB, and at key points

say," she added.

Jon Berkowitz, another student of Hof-
fman's, said, “He did the best he could to
motivate the debates and other class
activities."

Hoffman was also active trying to bring
education to the community through his
work with the Capitol District's
Humanities Program. said Ellinwood.

Sung Bok Kim. chair of the History
Department. recalled Hoffman's “in-
satiable appetite for new ideas and new ap-
proaches." adding, “We are all sorry that
he is gone." '

Hoffman's class. Trials in History will
now be taught by several different pro-
fessors. “There is no way that we could
ﬁnd a single professor who could cover all
of that material and who knew as many
aspects of history as he did.” said Kim.
who added, “We've had an over abun-
dance of volunteers to teach his class."

Hoffman taught at SUNYA for 16
years. He earned his Ph.D. at Brandeis
University and is survived by his wife
Valerie. three children and his mother.

Memorial Fund for Peace" in care of the

a Lincoln, Neb., clinic near the University
of Nebraska. “The prime people coming
into thc'clinic with problems are 19 to 30
years old."

And more are coming in. UCLA’s
Linder said. “The best indicator of scvcri-
ty and escalation of the problem can be
measured by the number of treatment
centers and the number of patients they
treat." hc claimed. “There are a lot!"

Yet “most schools don't have real drug
abuse policies." Washton of 800/CO«
CAINE pointed out.

At the University of Tennessee. drug
and alcohol abusers are referred to the stu-
dent counseling ccnter. And Universliy of
Alabama drug and alcohol abusc is handl-
cd by the student hcalth center or the men»
tal hcalth clinic.

Some schools rcfcr drug abusc patients
to off-campus community resources.
Clemson students go to a county drug
abuse program. The University of
Nebraska-Lincoln uscs Engcl’s in-
dependence Center, affiliated with Lincoln
General Hospital. “The hotlinc has lots of
contact with students from small col-
leges.” he stressed. “Coke is not only
available in larger schools. but also in
remote areas you wouldn't suspect, like
Wyoming. South Dakota and Alaska."

The University of Wyoming has no
speciﬁc drug counseling program and at
Boise State University in ldaho, counselors
admit to knowledge of campus drug abuse
but say students are reluctant to bring drug
problems to the counseling center.

“Unless these colleges prepare to handle
student drug abuse, they'll be caught off-
;uard by unpleasant incidents." cautioned
Washton. “At stake is the health and
welfare of our nation's future.” III

I“ 7 WCDB’s election network faced some snags

throughout the Albany area. Chonigman
said.

The ENCN. besides being convenient
for the listeners. also saved WCDB money.
according to Chonigman. “Because of the
network, we saved money by not having to
send people to New York City or Vermont.
A lot of people are concerned about their
rnccs back home," he said. adding that the
network made that coverage possible.

The only costs to the station were 30
dollars for two Campus Center Activities
employees to guard the equipment during
the hours the Campus Center was open.
"phone hills and minimal equipment
costs." ('llonigman reported.

Wallace said. “i think it went good. The
pcopleworking did a good job —— they are
to be commended.“ [j
