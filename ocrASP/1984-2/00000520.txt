Heavy emphasis on grades
leads to stress in students

Salt Lake City, UT
(COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE) College classes
can give students harmful doses of stress
and pressure, according to a new Universi-
ty of Utah study.

In many college classes “there is an
overemphasis of grades” and other
academic requirements that put “un-
necessary” pressure on students, said
David Spendlove, one of three Utah
medical instructors who conducted the
study of professional, graduate and
undergraduate students here.

Withholding grades and test scores,
publicly posting grades, and not clearly
defining what kind of performance is ex-
pected of students create needlessly high
levels of anxiety among students. the study
reported. “A lot of times it seems like
teachers enjoy hiding things from
students, trying to make it as difficult as
possible for them to learn.“ Spendlove
said. “This is not teaching. It's just hur-
ting the students,” he added.

“Many students have stress because they
feel they have no control" over their
academic lives, said study co—author Claire
Clark. Stress, she added. is “a discomfor-
Iing response of a person in a particular
situation.”

“Not all stress is negative,” Clark said.
In fact, “the right amount of stress is
positive because it is motivating." But too
much stress can damage students’ learning
abilities, she added, causing them to
become confused. frustrated and out of
touch with their schoolwork.

Frequently, stressed-out students
overstudy or study minute details, missing
the “big picture" of a class, the study said.

But good instructors. the researchers
note, can eliminate much of the excess
stress that plagues students. For one thing,
“teachers should emphasize excitemen
about a subject rather than competition.’
said Spcndiovc. “Excitement is much
more rewarding."

Instructors also should mingle with their
students, and get to know them as people,
he said. “By socializing with students,"
Spendlovc explained. "facility make
themselves more approachable. more
human." And insturctors should en-
courage students to socialize with cach
other. loo, by allowing advanced students
to tutor beginners. the study suggested.

Students also should know curly in the
class what is expected of them. the study
said. Clark added it is vital for instructors
to give feedback to students so they have
some idea of their pcrformace levcl. D

$103M computer contract
may force ethics violations

.COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE) The col-
lege that wins a lucrative, $103 million
Pentagon grant — one of the most avidly-
sought government contracts in recent
memory — may live to regret it. a com—
puter industry critic claimed.

The winning campus may be forced to
let the Department of Defense (DoD) dic-
tutc its engineering courses. and follow
strict DoD rules that could violate normal
scientific ethics. said Kenton Pattie of the
Intcrnutional Communications Industries
Association. a computer trade group. ‘

The contract will also put the winning
college in direct competition with private
computer industries, hc maintained.

The Pentagon expccls to announce ils
choice in November to host its new Soft-
wnrc Engineering Institute (SE1), which
will research and develop computer soft-
ware for military uscs.

Five colleges remain in the competition
for the fivc<ycar SIZI contract. The Pen-
tugon won’t name the compclilors, pickch
from a longcr list ol~ 14 universities lhnt
submitted bids for the contract.

The SEI would “authorize onc universi-
ty to hustle. badger and press various can»
pus engineering departments to make
changes to what a Department of Defense
model department should be," Pattie
warned. “The DoD should stay out of the
role of dictating curricula." he added.

Some universities known to be under
consideration for the contract, however,
say there is no way the DoD could control
the course content their students take. “I
doubt if it's any serious problem for con-
cern." said Dr. Daniel Tcichrocw of the
University of Michigan. “It's a federally
fundcd research and development center
and, as such. the rules are vcry clearly
spelled out."

“There are no instructions from the
DoD,” agreed Dr. Carl Weiss. Nor-
theastern University provost. “The
|government can only react to the proposal
,we submit. It's entirely up to us."

The Pentagon will not make curriculum
Irecommendations. but will provide non«
ibinding general guidelines for operating
the SEI, a DoD official said.

But possible curriculum control is only
[one worry, said Pattie. whose group would

like to have private businesses get the
government money. “Our deeper con-
cern." he stressed. “is that no basic
research would be done at SEI, only up-
plicd rcscarch. That’s the normal function
of software engineering companies."

“There will be no dislinguishing bet-
ween SEI and a private company cxccpt
lhnt SEI won‘t have to compete for
money,“ Pattie said.

I’rivutc industry already can solve
government software problems through a
privately-fumlcd group ofdclicuse contrac-
tors, he added. “lt;s outrageous," I’uttic
cxclnimcd. “Tnxpuycrs shouldn't pay for
somcllling privale industry is already
doing.“

Ilul software quality and production is in
major prohlcm, UM's 'I‘cichrocw urgucs,
and “the more rcsczu'ch the better. A
private organization wouldn't be It
substitute for \vat the government
nccds," hc pointcd out. “SEI is intended
to give the government impartial
expertise."

Whoever gets the SEI contract could
face an ethical qucslion us well.

Over the last two academic years. It
number of prestigious research universities
have protested new Pentagon efforts to
make campus scientists working on
government grants scck DoD approval
before publishing thcir research results.

In April. Stanford, MIT, and the
California Institute of Technology warned
the Reagan administration that “approval
clauses” in research contracts would in-
hibit free communication among resear-
chcrs. If the government keeps attempting
its “censorship,” the three universities
warned, they'll stop bidding for govern-
mcnt research money.

' The SEI “involves a lot of secret stuff,"

Pattie contended. “The winning university
will get this secret work and no other
university will get the information."

The DoD will release research results on
a “need to know" basis. he said, mainly to
defense contractors, not to colleges.
“Schools may never get the benefit of this
rcsearch," he lamented. “It will be secret.
It deals with computers that aim missiles at
people."
