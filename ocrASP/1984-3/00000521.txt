Said Soldini,“l didn't know
how close I was until somebody
told me i had two yards to go."

Running the ball 34 times did
take its toll on Soldini.

"At about 1:30 Saturday
night," said Soldini, "i realized
that i had just run the ball 34
times and all of a sudden my
whole body tightened up."

The Marist game was indicative
of Soldini’s whole season; Soldini
started off slowly and got better
as the season wore on.

against lthaca and New Haven it
seemed as if Soldini was not fully
recovered from 'the broken fibula
he had suffered in the first game
of the previous season.

“My legs didn't feel good in the
first two games," said Soldini.
“Both of my ankles felt sore.”

But his leg healed because of an
extensive program that he was put
on by Albany State’s Head
Trainer lack Koelmel.

“We did some rehab work in
the summer,” said Koelmel, “But
he worked very hard in the right
direction.

“We would tell him what we
wanted him to do and he did
whatever we asked and more.”

Both Koelmel and Dr. James
Striker who performed the
surgery had a lot to do with
Soldini’s comeback.

“He (Jack) was great.” said
Soldini. “He really spent a lot of
time with me. He and Dr. Striker

Against Brockport in the third
game of the year, Soldini gained
i25 yards, then three games later
he ran for 108 yards versus
Cortland.

Then came the Norwich game
when Soldini really went off. He
ran for 209 yards on that day in-
cluding a 91-yard scamper on the
second play from scrimmage.

“That run really made me feel
good,” said Soldini, who carries a
3.5 GPA in his classes at, Albany.
“i had some good runs before but
i never broke one all the way."

After that. Soldini had a
l33-yard effort at Hofstra and a
90-yarder against Buffalo. Then
came Saturday’s 162 yards to set
the record.

All throughout the season
Soldini was a consummate team
player.

During the Marist game Soldini
didn’t mind blocking. Both Ford
and Priore said that Soldini is tur-
ning himself into a great blocker.

“He's very tenacious," said
Ford. “He worked hard at
whatever we taught him."

His teamwork was never as ap-
parent as in the Marist game,
when he was urging on the
defense the whole game.

 

“Breaking the record was the

   

high point of the season for me,”
said Soldini on Sunday night’s
WCDB Sports Spotlight.
“Because it was something we ac-
complished as a team and We
never had such a team feeling as i
did at that point.

"Coach Priore was behind me
all season and (Offensive Line
Coach Ed) Zaloom did a great job
with the offensive line and they
really did a great job for me."

Tom DeBlois, whose record
Soldini broke, said from his of-
fice, “it’s super. Records are
made to be broken. i didn't know
anyone was that close even
though i came to a few games this
year. God bless him.”

“i feel bad that it's broken, but
congratulations to the kid who
broke it. i'm glad my record
made it in this year‘s program. i
won't show my kids next year’s
program."

Soldini still has one more year
of eligibility because he missed
last year due to his injury.

“l’m glad now that l have that
extra year of eligibility," said
Soldini.

Said Ford, “Dave is only a
junior as far as eligibility, we'll
have to wait and see how he
stacks up next year."

d.“i yelled at them and they started
working together. i said, ‘Okay. They’re
all veterans, and they know what they have
to do, and if they don't do it. well, it’s go-
 ing to be a long ride home."

it was exactly then that the Danes' ex-
perience and determination began to show.
While McGill and Clements kept Albany
in contention up front. junior Craig
' Pariato led co-eaptains Chris Callaci and
Jim Erwin through the last two miles in
what one coach called “the most tremen-
dous surge l've ever seen." At the front of
the Dane trio, Pariato blew past more than
twenty-five runners in those last two miles
to close the gap and finish one place
behind Clements. Callaci and Erwin surg-
‘ ed and kicked along with Pariato to turn
the tables on Fredonia and brieﬂy threaten
. St. Lawrence’s claim on first place.

Said Erwin. "St. Lawrence was moving
up that whole time, so we said, ‘that’s it,
let's nail ‘em."’ Callaci explained,“A lot

Pariato added. “ it was pretty obvious
hat we had a do-or-die situation, and thc
aster we ran, the tnorc it looked like
redonia and the other guys were dropping
ke birds over industrial New Jersey."
Across the line, McGill finished seventh
overall in 25:38, exactly thirty seconds
ahead of the rest of the Dane pack.
Clements hung on to finish 15th in 26:08,
while Pariato outkicked Union star Chris
O'Donnell to take loth in 26:]0. Both
Callaci (26:i8) and Erwin (26:24) put on
strong kicks to finish 19th and 23rd
respectively.

Men barriers reach NCAAs

I Albany's displacement runners also had
a good day. Sophomore Tim Hoff was
45th overall in 26:52, while junior Chuck
Bronner came out of nowhere to slide past
Frcdonia's seventh man, Chico Purcio,
and finish 6"" ill 27:".

Hoff said. “'i'ht .utn n ran ﬁrst. so

when we got out th. l : it was a real'mess. -

The last seventy yarc. were a mud slide in-
to the chute.“

The harriers’ strong performance was
significant in several respects. Said Erwin,
“it shows you how far we've come when
last year we upset Fredonia to get third and
this year we take second and people ask us
if we’re going to beat St. Lawrence at Na~
tionals. Nobody would have believed it a
year ago.”

“There’s no longer any doubt that we
are a power in Division ill." McGill said.
“We've beaten the Fredonia dynasty three
times in a row; we are now the best SUNY
team period."

Asked about the tcams’ chances at Na-
tionals, Munsey commented. "i actually
predicted the finish at Regionais, but the
National Championships will be very, very
tight this year, so we could be tenth, and
then who knows. We need someone else to
rttn up with McGill and they can all do it.
Anything can happen. We're
thoroughbreds this year." Said Erwin,“A
couple of teams like St. Lawrence are
slightly overrated and on a good day, we
could shock a lot of those people."

The Danes will leave Thursday for the

Country Championships. Saturday. Ohio~

State. 15-2, 15-6, in the ﬁrst
match of the round—robin com-
petition. Buffaio was seeded i2th.
The Danes’ next opponent was
Binghamton. whom the Danes
defeated, 15-”, 15-6. The

University of Buffalo provided a
litic more excitement, as they beat
the Danes, 14-16 in the first game.
Albany won game two by the
score of 15-7, and sweated out a
16-14 victory in the deciding
game.

Saturday morning, the spikcrs
finished the round robin with a
match against second seeded
Oneonta, which Albany won,
15-10, 15-13.

in the quarterﬁnals, Albany
met Piattsburgh and ﬁnished
them off, 15-13. 15-12. The team
came close to being eliminated by

Oneonta in the semifinals. They
lost the first game 13-15 and came
within two points of losing game
two before squeeking out a lS-l3
victory. They found their niche in
the final game, winning 15-4 and
moving on to the finals against
fourth-seeded Cortland. The Red
Dragons proved to be no match
for the superior Albany squad, as
they succumbed, 15-10. 15-4, and
took second to the Danes in the
tournament. I

According to coach Patrick
Dwyer the whole seeding system
was incorrect.

“It usually works out that the
better teams play later in the tour-
nament,” said Dwyer, “But we
