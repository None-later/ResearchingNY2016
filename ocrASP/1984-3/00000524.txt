Crime spurs proposal

Paris. France
(AP) A series oftorture-killings of elder-
ly women in Paris has spurred conservative
legislators to launch the first major effort
to restore the death penalty since the
guillotine was outlawed three years ago.

France has been shocked by the slayings
of nine elderly women in the past minth.
including seven who were tortured. No ar-
rests have been tnade.

capital punishment would almost certainly
be crushed by the governing Socialists.
who control the National Assembly.

The real battle is political. with the
French right accusing President Francois
Mitterrand's Socialist government ofbeing
lax about crime and the government accus-
ing the right of cynically playing on the
fear of the people in hopes of political
gain.

Testing to continue

Washington. DC.
(AP) The Reagan administration said it
won‘t halt testing of art anti-satellite
system to meet Soviet requirements for
superpower talks on limiting space

“We would certainly be willing to
discuss a test moratorium, as we would
many topics. but we would have to go to
the conference table to discuss it.;; White
House spokesman Larry Speakes said
Wednesday.

At the same time. Soviet President
Konstantin U. Chernenko called anew for
U.S.-Soviet arms control talks. saying an
“unontrolled escalation of the arms race
and its extensions even to outer space  is
a threat to the United States’ own
security."

Jim Vacca. who led the neighborhood

Student questions rights t

By Ian Clements
STAFF WRITER

Michael Butler returned to his
room on Indian Quad one night
last week to find his door open
and two workers repairing the
heating unit in his room. He says
his textbooks were “strewn about
the floor" and a stereo speaker
had been moved. No one had told
him about the repairs. causing
him. he says. to question
students’ rights to privacy in their
dorm rooms.

In a letter written to his
Residence Director. Butler, a
senior. criticized the Residential
Life staff for allowing the
workers to enter his room without
his consent.

Butler said his Resident Assis-
tant (RA). Katherine Hobert.
called the plant and asked that a
repair crew be sent to his room.
She informed his suitematc,
Kevin Sicger. but neither Butler
nor another suitcmatc, Cecil
Weathcrly, whose room was also
entered. were told that the repairs
were going to be made, said
Butler.

The third room in the suite was
not entered, according to Butler.

The workmen did “have a
right" to go into Butler's room
because a repair call was placed at
the plant though the call was not
made by Butler. said John Mar-
tonc. Assistant Vice President for

Residential Life and Student.

Maintenance workers can enter without students’ permission

“The plant department acted
appropriately,” Martone said. “I
would not want. quite frahkly. to
have students go without heat for
two or three days” while waiting
for the plant to set up an appoint-
ment to enter one student’s room.
he said.

The workers were let into the
room by the RA on duty at the
time. Butler said. He said he

could not identify the RA.

Butler lives in a single room in
Adirondack Hall. He has no
roommate.

According to Martone.
students' rooms cart be entered
without their consent if
"emergency" action is required.

“I don't see how a broken
heater constitutes an emergency.“
Butler asserted.

Butler maintained that Caren
Brown. his Residence Director.
told him it was an emergency
situation, but Brown now refuses
to comment.

The problem affecting the
heating system was an “air bub-
ble." Butler said.

Air bubbles are generally not
dangerous. according to John
Livingston. Chief of the Utilities

Branch of SUNYA’s Physical
Plant. He added. however. “If
there is air in the system. it affects
heat throughout the system (of a
hall)." All heat could be cut off

from a side ofa hall if an air bub-

ble is not “bled” out, Livingston
explained.

“We can't get (the plant) to pin
themselves down” on when

they‘re going to enter a student'5“~

room. Livingston added.

Martone asserted. “I honestly.
personally don’t see a problem
with this (situation) except that
they did move his things."

Most students place objects
against the convector. the part of
the heating system that was
repaired in Butler’s room. Liv-
ingston said. Plant employees are
often forced to move those ob-
jects iri order to reach the convec-
tor. he added.

"Several rooms" were affected
by the heating failure that pro-
mptcd the workers to enter
Butler’s room. Livingston said.
“One convector goes the whole
length of a building." he
explained.

also-complained that he should
have been informed that repairs
were scheduled to be made in his
room. “It's a violation of our
rights." he said. “Everything on

ray." he added. I3

Marchers protest US involvement in Nicaragua

By Tom Bergen
SI'AI‘I“ Will“ R

“USA. CIA. Ottt of Nicaragua"
chanted ISO marchers in front of the Na-
tional Guard Armory in downtown
Albany Tuesday night.

The protesters marched through the fall-
ing snow carrying signs with slogans such
as “Send your favorite Republican to boot
camp —— Let them fight” and "Bonzo
Loves Bombs."

The rally was hcltl to protest the “recent
U.S. escalation of tensions betwen
Nicaragua and the U.S.." according to
Kathy Griffin. a spokesperson for the Cen-
tral American Solidarity Alliance, which
organized the protest.

On November 6th. United States 011
l'icittls reported that a Soviet freighter
suspected of 'arrying MIG-21 jet fighters
was on its way to Nicaragua.

According to an article in the New York

Times on November Ilth, the officials
would not rule out the use of military force
to disable the jets if Nicaragua received
them.

It was later concluded that although the
freighter carried military helicopters and
patrol boats. there were no MlG's aboard.

Griffin charged that the Reagan Ad-
ministration was using the MIG scare “to
generate public and Congressional support
for u U.S. invasion of Nicaragua." adding
that. “The Nicaraguan government has
the smallest amount of weapons in Central
America.”

Among the protesters was SUNYA stu‘
dent Brian VanGrol, who said. “I'm here
to show my support for the Nicaraguan
revolution and my displeasure with the
Reagan Administration's illcgul war
against Nicaragua.”

VanGrol added. “If Ronald Reagan
wants me to go to Nicaragua and figltt. I'll

go, bill I won't fight for the U.S.“

Also marching was Richard Ariza. a
former SUNYA student. who ran for Con-
gress this year as the candidate of the
Socialist Workers Party.

Ariza said that public demonstrations

were important because. “the government
knows that (demonstrations are) going on
and their policies are unpopular. The peo-
ple in this country don't want a war."
One of those who spoke to the crowd
was Bill Crandlc. vice president of the

larger war. but even if it doesn’t it's a terri-
ble waste of life and money."

the champions of democracy. we've gotten
to the point where we back every right-

llnrlerqning Illc serious concerns of Singer'x Spll‘fliliil_(/I‘(illlll5., _ ,
....... . .....................

 

By Jacquie Clark
STAFF WRITER

Collaboration between a
SUNYA professor and Nobel
Prize winning author Isaac
Bashcvis Singer has resulted in an
off-Broadway smash play which
has now been signed on for an ex-
tra two weeks.

The play. eo-writtcn by Singer
and English professor Sttrah
Blacker Cohen is called Shiemiel
the First. and is based on two of
Singer's children's stories. Its
been performed for full houses
since 'it opened last montlt.

Cohen has described the play.
which opened October 14 urthe
Jewish Repertory Theater in New
York City. as a “children's corn-
cdy for adults which burlesqucs
the serious concerns of Singer's
spiritual dramas.“ Although iti-
itiully slated for a five wcck run,

the play has been extended for an _

additional two weeks.

Taken from two of Singer‘s
works: When Shlcrniel Went to
Warsaw and the The Tools of
Chaim and Their History. the
story was adapted for the stage by
the Cohen-Singer team.

Cohen said the play. as well as
working with Singer. has changed
sortie of her opinions. “This ex-
perience has legitimized creative
writing for me. I see the aritistry
and craft that Is required. I see the
amount of revision necessary to
attain perfection." she explained.

Working on Slilelnicl the First
has. Cohen said. given her con-
fidence and pride. She also said
she looks at the experience in two
ways. “One. us it beginning
playwright. It is a first project
and I am proud. but it's not
perfect. It needs more work.
Two. as it literary critic. I could
see theprobleniutic flaws in the

SUNYA prof’s play is a smash hit off-Broadway

work. yet I wait proud and
pleased.

Cohen said she would love to
bring the play to Albany. but
would make some changes before
having it performed itt the area.
“I see where it could be improv-
cd. Nothing is ever finished." she
noted. adding. “For me it was a
success."

At least one local critic agreed.
Eleanor Koblenz from tht
Schenectady Gazette called the
play a “delightful rendition” of
Singer's stories which “can be en-
joyed by anyone with a sense of
humor. even if he's not Jewish."

It is a play. Koblenz continued
in her review. about "illogical

logic.... which uses simple staging ‘

and childlike" painted backdrops

to complement the nuivcte of the
characters.
