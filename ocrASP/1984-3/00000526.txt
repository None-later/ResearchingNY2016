40, 000 SUN'Y stadents face Reagan aid 389%

By Ilene Welnsteln
sanctum. mswvr

Up to 2,400 SUNYA students
across New York, will be adverse-
ly affected if President Reagan’s
ﬁnancial aid proposals are made
law, predicts SUNYA's Director
of Financial Aid Donald
Whitlock.

The proposals. he said, con-
stitute "a real assault on higher

education funding."

Whitlock said the I965 Higher
Education Act, which Congress
must reauthorize every three to
ﬁve years, will expire in October,
I985. The act encompasses all
federally administered ﬁnancial
aid programs.

“There is ttot a clear cut cott-
sensus on how programs should
be determined,” Whitlock said.

adding that the administration of
the programs, as well as the pro-
grams themselves will be under
review.

“it will take the Reagan ad-
ministration at least eight months
to regroup” and put forward a
comprehensive financial aid pro-
posal, Whitlock stated, adding “i
don't know what I985 is going to
look like budgetariiy."

$1 7.98 education packageawaits approval

(COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE) Students locked out of
I984 federal financial aid programs could ﬁnd some
opened doors next year if President Ronald Reagan
signs the fiscal 1985 education funding bill now on
his desk.

Experts predict Reagan will sign H.R. 6028,
which contains the federal education budget for the
October 1, I984 to September 30, I985 fiscal year,
and was passed October II by both ltouscs of
Congress.

Student financial aid funds comprise nearly $8
billion of the total Sl7.9.billion education package,
with $3.6 billion earmarked for Pell grants and $3
billion for Guaranteed Student Loans (GSL). “We
think the increases will loosen up financial aid
substantially," Lou Dietrich, Department of
Education spokeswoman reported, "The budget
exceeds our request for I985 and provides a great
deal of aid."

Nevertheless, some aid directors around the
country fear the increases may be too little, to late
to help current students, and that they‘re not big
enough to help students new to the aid programs.

Still, Congress's aid budget is $I.7 billion more
than last year's, and nearly $1.5 billion tnorc than
the president wanted in the I985 budget.

in his budget request, delivered to Congress last
February, Reagan wanted to fund the Pell program
at its I984 level, eliminate Supplemental Educa-
tional Opportunity Grants (SEOG) and State Stu-
dent inccntive Grants, drastically cut National
Direct Student Loans (NDSL) attd increase

Work/Study and GSL allocations.

in addition, the Office of Management and
Budget earlier this year proposed letting inﬂation
eat away more aid programs by keeping budgets the
same through the next four years. Congress instead
has increased the total education budget by 14 per-
cent and sent it to the White House for Reagan’s
signature.

“There are increases in just about every program
for I985," Dietrich noted. “it certainly provides
students with ntore aid options."

The SEOG program would get $40 million,
NDSLs' $35 million tnore and College Work/Study
$37.5 million there than I984 levels if Reagan sigtts
the bill into law. ‘

College financial aid directors around the coun-
try, battered by four years ofaid cttts, seem relieved
but unsated. “We‘ve always had a problem here
with lack of funds," Alan Shipley of Northern
Arizona University explained, “Any increase will
make it easier for students to apply for and receive
the dollars they need."

“The increases are good," .leff Baker of San
Francisco State agreed, “But l'd like to see more of
them and more changes."

“We have a critical problem here," Montana
State Financial Aid Director Jim Craig said, hoping
the increases won’t come too late. “Lots of
students apply and we have no funds for them."

“The budget for financial aid has not grown with
the cost of living," he added. [3

According to one of Reagan's
original proposals. all federal stu-
dent aid grants will be grouped
under a single grant program,
presumably the Pell Grant, which
is based on need as documented
by an applicants last reported in-
come statements. Programs like
National Direct Student Loan
(NDSL) and Supplemental
Education Opportunity Program
(SEOP) would be phased out,
said Whitlock.

All federal loan programs
would also be grouped together
under the Guaranteed Student
Loan Program (GSL), said
Whitlock, who added that the
government is trying to stress “a
mandatory self-help program.”

Students must begin repaying
their loans within 90 days of
graduation, Whitlock said, noting
that the new program is designed
to ensure loans are paid back. “In
the current job market, students
with a large indebtedness may not
be able to repay with case," he
said.

Whitlock also said that “GSL
interest rates are tied to the
prevailing market in some
degree,” adding that student loan
rates, which are currently at 8.9
percent, may fall to 7 percent if
the economy continues in its cur-
rent good health.

The loss of programs like the
SEC? will reduce an institution’s
“capacity to help its own
students." said Whitlock.
because Peil Grant does not give a
school any flexibility in helping
students that do not meet exact
financial need criterion, he
added.

Students whose families are in

 

the $20,000 to $35,000 income
range would be most severely af.
fected by the Reagan proposals,
said Whitlock, while students in
the lowest income range would
also feel adverse affects because
more people will be competing for
less money.

According to Whitlock about
40,000 to 50,000 students SUN):
wide would be affected by the
Reagan administration's plans.
"This is a conservative guess, bttt

the effects will be very drturuttiu,"
he added.

These new proposals “in pro.
bably not affect \ltllt‘ cn-

titlements. explained Whitlock,
adding that if they do, tht York
State would be affected mutt
because it provides more higher
education assistance than :lll)‘ of
the other 49 states.

in an attempt to combat fraud
and abuse in the financial itid
system, Wltitlock said regulations
will also be put into effect lilill
will raise the standard of :tt‘coutr
[ability for financial aid.

independent student -.tttttr~
rules will be tnore stringent and
will require more verification thtu

from his or her family, Whitlock
said.

The United States Student
Association (USSA) is planning
to vote on their own financial Iiiti
proposal this weekend zit at
Washington D.C. conference,
said Ross Abclow, a SU. ‘YA
delegate to USSA. "Anything
that cuts down on students rights,
USSA will not support." he said,
adding that USSA “ill submit
their proposal to the gmerntttent

News Updates

Kitchen key lost

Students on Colonial Quad haven’t been
able to get into their kitchen since the key
to it was lost last year.

According to Colonial Quad Board
president Lori Friedman, the key to the
kitchen was lost last year when students
were given access to it through the quad
ofﬁce. ‘

“I just found out a week or so ago that
Quad Board was responsible for that
room," said Friedman. “i thought it was
residential life’s responsibility.“ she said.

“We've beeit waiting for residential life
to make new keys,” said Friedman, adding
that she doesn't know when the keys will
be replaced.

Soda sales increased

Since changing over from Coke to Pepsi
products this year, UAS soda sales have in-
creased $2,400 for the month of
September.

Zahm suggested that soda sales may have
increased because Pepsi offers a more ex-
tensive line of products to SUNYA soda
drinkers. ‘

Despite Jewish holidays that had many
students taking an entire week off in
September, sales remained higher than last
year, partly due to the fall semester star-
ting earlier this year.

‘Smoke In’ staged

A few students staged a “Smoke In"
Thursday in front of the Campus Center,
giving away free packs of cigarettes to
passers-by and encouraging people to start
the habit, while the Great American
Smokeout in the Campus Center lobby
asked smokers to quit for twenty four
hours.

'The Great Smokeout, sponsored by the
TKE fraternity of SUNYA, also asked
non-smokers to participate in Adopt a
Smoker to help a fricttd quit for twenty
four hours by encouraging them with
support.

Peter Jones, one student who staged the

“Smoke In," said that he was “sick of
jocks" who “got on their backs” about
smoking. He was not sponsored by any
company to give out free packs of
cigarettes.

TKE President Barry Pollack said over
470 students participated in the Great
Smokeout and a drawing was held on
Thursday at 5pm giving away a free dinner
for two at the Dutchess, a mug from the
bookstore and a free album or tape from
SUNYTunes.

tion Robert Koff has been reappointed by
