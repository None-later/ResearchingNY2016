. 1 Notre Dame’s Knute Rockne statue .
works on tan, parties, attendsgame :’

 

 

South Bend, IN
(COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE) For
someone who dies in 193 l , former
Notre Dame football coach Knute
Rockne still gets around pretty
well.

Over the last year the loo
pound, two-foot tall Knute
Rockne bust has attended at least
one student graduation party,
visited the shores of Lake
Michigan. and journeyed to In-
dianapolis recently for the Notre
Dame-Purdue football game.

The bust, affectionately known
around campus as “Rockne.”
was ﬁrst vanished from Notre
Dame's Memorial last May 3rd.
Two weeks later, editors at the
student paper, The Observer,
were surprised to receive a ran-
som note and photograph of the
campus football legend sunning
at an unnamed beach.

Among other things, the note
warned that Rockne would not
return “until the students get
their beer,” apparently referring
to a new student drinking policy
that restricts on-campus bcer con-
sumption, explained Observer
editor Bob Vonderhcide. The col-
or picture showcd the sunglass-
clad Rockne rcposing in the sand,
surrounded by a boom-box radio,
a keg of beer. and a frisbcc.

In the meantime. the empty
pedestal in Rockne Memorial
became too much to bear for
many students and ad-
ministrators. Hoping to re-
capturc at least some of the aura
of the missing Rockne, officials
replaced it with a smaller replica

FRIDAY. November: defies}:

 

dubbed “Rockne Junior."

Over the' summer campus
police, befuddled by the mystery
of the missing bust, began work-
ing on leads that Rockne was
hiding out somewhere in Los
Angeles. recalled Notre Dame
Security Chief Glenn Terry.

0n Spetembcr It, a few days
after a Notre Dame-Purdue foot-
ball gamc. Observer editors
received a second anonymous
note and several photographs
showing Rockne in at Purdue

welcome sign to Purdue Universi-
ty in Lafayette, Ind.

world — Paris, London, Rome 1-
saying things like ‘Having a
wonderful time, wish you were
here,‘ and signed ‘Father Sorin."’
Eventually. Father Sorin was
found buried in a golf course sand
trap, “none the worse for wear."

Both the Observer and The
Notre Dame Monthly, the cam-
pus magazine, did storics last spr-
ing recounting th Sorin statue
caper, Vonderheidc said.

Rockne's bust vanished only
days after the articles appeared. It
ﬁnally was returned at a Sept.
23rd pep rally. “It just showed up
during the rally," Vonderhcide
recalled, and elated authorities
quickly whisked Rockne off to
secure quarters.

But while everyone was
celebrating Rockne's return, the
worst happened. Rockne Junior
vanished. In its place the culprits
left a jack-o-lantern and two
handwritten notes, one of which
read “Here's a buck for your
troubles." Chief Terry still won't
disclose the contents of the sc-
cond notc.

“1 went on a long road trip to

typewritten message was signed
