Professor Cohen has off-Broadway smash

<3 ‘ ‘

volvcd In the casting‘of the play, she said
she has developed “maternal feelings"
towards the cast. She explained that
although there were some original cast
changes and minor line changes, she has
developed a warm relationship with the
performers and has been impressed by
their committment.

Opening night. she said, offered her a
new perspective on her work. “Suddenly l
saw the characters in my head come to life
on stage. it was like giving birth." she said
of the experience.

The cast, Cohen said, looked to her for
approval since she was acting as Singer’s
representative. She served many functions,
she said, explaining, “l was teacher. critic,
editor, and writer."

During the four week rehearsal period.
Cohcit said she “made cuts to tighten

things, to make concise speeches, (and to)
heighten humor and drama” in the play.
On preview night, October I3, Singer
did not attend the performance. instead.
he called called Cohen to find out how it
went. She said that when she assured him
of the play's success, he replied, “‘l was so
worried, I was so worried; I thought l
would be disgraced’." Cohen said she
found it amazing that even a great writer
like Singer could have such insecurities.

Cohen said Shlemiel the First would not
be her last effort as a playwright. Singer,
she said, has asked her to look at several
copies of plays that he wrote but were
never published.

And in addition, Cohen said, she has

 

been asked to write a one-character show
for one of the cast members of Slilemiel

 

the First. U

fresh approach.” According to Cassese.
the cover letter is where you ask for an in-
terview. “You've got to he a salesman,”
he said.

Resumes should be mailed to the person-
nel director or president of 'a company.
“Let the president know that you are out
there. you’re hot, and you don't know
how their company has gotten along
without you,” said Cassese.

Casses suggested using the Standard
Directory of Advertisers. which lists the
addresses of all major companies across
the nation. “You should know the name
of the person you’re writing to," he said,
“Don't just address the letter to ‘Dear Sir‘
or ‘To Whom It May Coriccrn‘,” he
explained.

According to Cassese, an applicant
should practice for interviews. “Have a
two-minute wrap-up prepared dealing with
yourself a'rid'things you’ve done," he said.
“This is the tiiite you cart embellish the
things you included in your resume," he
explained. adding “students sitouid also
have qrtestioris prepared for the
company."

“Art interview lasts about 20 ttiinutes
and the interviewer sizes you tip in the first
few minutes." Casscse said. An applicant
should be careful wltat he or she wears.
“The more conservative you look, the
tnorc corporate you look, the better. Make
the interviewer picture you behind a desk
doing work,” he said.

Cassese relayed an anecdote of his first
interview. “i wore a forest green jacket.

Buffalo students vote

<Front Page

faio chapter of College Republicans, and
three other conservative grotips. waged a
' unified campaign for a voluntary fee at
SUNY-Buffalo.

“l believe a voluntary fee is much more
fair." said Balance Editor~in-Cliief David
Lieberman.

Lieberman said that the student activity
fee funds go to "politically-biased liberal"
student groups, such as the- Student
Associations. left-biased media, and some
ethic groups.

Students, Lieberman explained. should
have the right to citoosc whether or not to
fund these groups.

Student government officials have con-
tended that. if payment of the Student Ac-
tivity fee becomes voluntary, many
minority and ethic groups will not be given
a fair share of the funds. and may have
difficulty soliciting adequate membership
dues to run programs and events.

Before the vote on the referendum, Buf-
falo SA officials called on the campus to
support the fee. saying that without it,
“the whole structure is going to fall
apart."

McAlevey contended that if the fee
became voltiiitar'y. most of the student rttn
services on campus, such as the ambulance
corps and the.‘ ealth care center, would be
forced to shut down.

“They’re (the conservative coalition)
trying to destroy the existing structure with
no alternative." McAlcvey charged.

Lieberman said he supported a system
where students could “write in" the
amount of money they wished to go to
each campus organization on their tuition
bill. He also said that the Buffalo SA
would most likely be responsible for the
administration of these funds under his
plan.

Tire cight representatives illlll SUNYA's
SA scnt. passed out leaflets and lobbied to
students ahotit why they should vote fora
mandatory fee.

The trip. which cost SA about $150.
“really gave them (Buffalo‘s SA) a big
lift." Student Action (‘liiiir Steve (iawlcy

tan double-knit pants and a hawaiian print
shirt," said Cassese. “i looked like a stuff-
ed sausage.” he joked.

“Don't let it be their decision not to of-
fer you a job — make it your decision
whether or not to accept the job." said
Cassese.

“Rejection letters are all part of the
game." warned Cassese, explaining that
no one should be stopped by this. “Per-
sistance will win yon the job hunting
game." he added.

Several students in the audience felt
Cassese’s hints were useful. “He mention-
ed things I wouldn’t think about. like the
two-minute talk at interviews,” said Bar-
bara Mangerian, a junior. “These are
things i will put to use.” she added.

The suggestion of writing to the presi-
dent of the company caught the attention
of Site Klein, a senior, who felt that site
had heard most of the resume information
before.

“i didn’t know what to do about going
in for art interview," agreed senior Allison
Mann. “Cassese sounded like he spoke
front experience," she said.

“i think he gave people coiifidettcc iii
tellirtg the things he did that were out of
the ordinary." said Rodney Lowenstein, a
senior. yet Casscse is successful despite
that. said Lowenstein.

Cassese's speech was sponsored by the
Albany Citaptcr of the American
Marketing Association, a group recogniz-
ed, but not funded, by Student Associa-
tiort. ['1

"seemed exhausted."

“We showed them what can be done,“
Gawlcy explained.

The push for a voluntary Student Activi-
ty Fee was “only the first of several ac-
tions" by the conservative coalition, ac-
cording to SUNY-Buffaio College
Republicans leader David Chodrow.

However, Cliodrow would not specify
what other plans his group was
considering. ‘

The University Balance and the four
other conservative groups have only
recently appeared on the Buffalo campus.
said McAievey, who said she suspects that
they are part of an organized nationwide
movement.

“That‘s simply 8.8.," Lieberman said,
claiming. “there’s no way we could have
connections with a national
organization.”

Some Buffalo students noted that persis-
tant rttmors have circulated their campus
which say these groups are receiving funds
from outside the Buffalo area.

According to Lieberman. the Balance
requested and was awarded $4,000 in
“seed money" from the institute for
Educational Affairs, a New York City bas-
ed firm which funds close to 70 right. wing
campus papers nationwide.

The institute. according to its Student
Journalism Advisement Program Coor-
dinator Jonathon Cohen, is “a non-profit

‘think tank."

Cohen called his firm a “meeting
ground" for academia and corporations.

lie said that the institute receives fitti-
ding from “a number of foundations," in-
cluding the Olin Foundation, as well as
front corporations such as Mobil Oil.

Cltodrow ciaiittcd that the College
Republicans raised money through club
dues. donations and fund raisers. and
received some funding from the National
Republican Party during the recent
presidential election.

ilttt‘l‘alo conservative organizations. the

5atanlc Influence on music seen

Smith pointed out that the word
music” is ctymologically derived from
c Greek word “muse,” a reference to arr
stic spirits. Smith stated that this was fur-
cr evidence of the proposition that music
spiritttal in nature.
» Quoting Biblical scripttircs to show that
bellion of any sort is evil, Smith said
mosexuality is "the ultimate forth of
. bellion," artd pointed out that such rock
erformers as David Bowie have
' knowledng their invoivciiient with
niosextiality.
Also discussed during the presentation

Smith played backwards. portions of-
ngs such as Gonna Raise Hell by Cheap
ick. Stairway to Heaven by Lcd Zep-
in, Highway to He]! by AC/1)C, and

r 5', iothcr One Bites the Dust by Queen.

ith contended that when the words

ﬂlng W Smith. he played backwards to
 call the ritcssagc. “Christ. you‘re

l erior.”
‘hc Cheap Trick song allegedly reveals
e line, “You know Satan holds the key

to tltc lock."

Siiiith stressed that his contentions
about Satanisrn in rock did not rely on
backmaskirig for support. btrt that he in-
cluded tiicnr because he felt it deserved
attention.

He did not accuse the musicians of iri-
tcritionally putting these “backrtiaskcd”
messages in their music. He said that the
hackiiiasking was of spiritual origin.
which, he added, support his thesis that
music is spiritual iti nature.

Smith crtcouraged those who wanted to
discuss God to corite forward afterwards
to talk. while implying that to follow a
path of rebellion and not follow his ideas
was tantamount to Satariism.

Reactions to the presentation varied
widely.

Jeff Hernandez, a SUNYA student, said
he “hated” the presentation. “it’s not
even fair because it doesn't even consider
another viewpoint," Hernandez said, ad—
ding. “If you're not iii agreement with his
viewpoint, you‘re a Satttiiist. Like ltc says
at the end. ‘You don’t have to accept what
l’nt saying. but if you walk out that door,
you're following the definition of
Satanisni’.”

SUNYA strident i’clcr l’crrriiilt, a
member of the Christian religious group
the Navigators. said he has seen a number
of seminars of this type. “Some were had,
some were superb, this one was very good.

rinintcntinally — is pointing away from
God and is mocking God."

Jeff care, an Albany resident and, a
rock musician. disagreed. "I think
(Reverand Smith) is a stupid. sciolistic
babboon. The presentation was a three
ring circus... inaccuracies abounded; he
lied about forty times during the presenta-
tiott and took numerous qtiotcs otit of
context."

Caro also charged that “by failing to
allow a traditional question and answer
period, he (Smith) showed that he wanted
to dodge confrontation. He only wanted to
talk to people who agreed with ltiiii. That‘s

not really a good forum for a collegiate
experience."

Peter Levine, a SUNYA student. said
that he had problems accepting the
delivery of the presentation. “People tend
to be persuaded by popular opinion and by
group-oriented sensationalism, which in
association with his message might be
another form of subliminal persuasion."
Sinitlifaccording to Levine, read "a lot of
negative things" into rock music.

Smith rcsportded to those who wondered
why there was no formal question and
answer period by saying. that the way he
delivers the presentation "keeps it on the
basis ofrclationsliip with God." i 1

snotty and cold. btit he's really nice.”
Clicrchcs said.

Citerelies also met his idol, former Odd
Couple star Tony Randall. He didn’t ex-
plain his choice of idols, btit pointed to his
closet, which could easily be Felix Uriger’s
own. it is intensely neat and organized.
“l'm very clean and neat. All my clothes
are memorized and organized." he said.
Clicrches also keeps all five years of his
coiiiiittinications notes together iii a loose
leaf notebook, and had a list of celebrities
he has met l‘ilcd away in one of his many
folders.

All iti all. Clicrchcs doesn't appear too
upset about moving on to a career iii I985.
“I guess you could call it ‘Goodbyc Mr.
Ncwsday. Hello Mr. NBC.‘ " he said.

“I'll miss State Quad arid Frank's (Liv-
ing Roont)." he predicted. Although he is
a frequent Frank‘s customer. Cherehes
said Iic doesn't drink alcohol. “i never
drink and l‘ve never had a puff of a
cigarette in my life. i guess I'm the All-
American Boy." he said.

Cherehes said his abstinence hasn't
caused arty social probleriis at scltool. He
explained, "Most people admire it and say
"fliat‘s cool. i cart respect that.’ "

He continued, "The reason i go to
Frank’s is because of Chris and John and
all the Husk members." Husk is a band
whose members include Clicrchcs' former
roommate and several other friends. With
more praise for Frank‘s Living Room. He
said, “Pitts. it‘s right across from Pop's
(Pizza Parlor)." I7
