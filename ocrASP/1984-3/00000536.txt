(AP) Pity three coaches in the Big East
'conference who have back the bulk of their
NCAA playoff teams from last season and
are included in many preseason Top Twen-
ty rankings.

Jim Boeheim of Syracuse, Lou
Carncsecca of St. John’s and Rollie
Masshnino of Villanova are the three men
who face a major roadblock as their teams
vie for the Big East title — defending na-
tional and conference champion
Georgetown.

The Hoyas, who registered a
school—record 34 victories against three
losses last year, return eight of 11 let-
termen and 84 percent of their offense
from last season, when they walked off the
Kingdome court as champions after
beating Houston 84-75.

Of the eight returnees, 7—foot,
two—time all—American center Patrick
Ewing stands in a class by himself.

Guards Fred Brown and Gene Smith
were lost to graduation and sophomore
forward Michael Graham, who eased the
rebounding load on Ewing, will sit out the
season for academic reasons.

“Georgetown is clearly No. l in the
country, Boeheim said. Offensively,
everyone is back and you have to realize
Graham didn't play that much until late in
the season. They'll be better this year than
last year."

Ewing led Georgetown’s balanced at-
tack last year with a 16.4 —point average.

very interesting to see how we fare.’?

The nature of the team, to run in a tight
pack, should work to its advantage this
weekend, for this is an important element
for success in large, invitational-type
races. That the spread between the first
and fifth runners has been a mere 45
seconds or less in the team’s most recent
races is a factor that may make White’s
goal a realization.

With individual honors, the attitude of

‘ the women‘s team is identical to that of the

men‘s. Karen Kurthy looks to have the
best chance of finishing in the top 25, and
thereby qualify as an All-American,
however this is not a dominant factor in
the minds of the runners.

“There are no real ‘standouts’ on this
‘ team, but rather a high amount of
cohesiveness and team unity. In this meet,
we are looking to gain experience and ex-
pose our cross country program. This meet
is our reward; our chance to represent the
university and New York State," remark-
‘ ed White.

Georgetown figures .to be
the Beast of t

he Big. East

and he will be joined again by juniors
David Wingate, 11.2 points per game, and
Michael Jackson, l0.2.

. Georgetown Coacch John Thompson
will have two titles to defend this year, and
other coaches have had trouble with both.

The last team from the East to win the
national championship was La Sallc in
1954, and no team has repeated as NCAA
chatnp since UCLA in 1973. No learn has
ever repeated as Big East champion in the
conference’s six — year existence.

St. John's will be showcasing old and
new players. The Redmen will be led by
Ewing’s gold —medal US. Olympic team-
mate Chris Mullin and junior college
phenom Waiter Berry.

Mullin averaged 22.9 points on 57 per-
cent shooting iast year as he shared con-
ference Player of the Year honors with
Ewing. Berry was a junior college

Ali—American at San Jacinto, Texas.

Villanova will lean heavily on senior for-
ward Ed Pinchney, who averaged l5.4
points and 7.9 rebounds last season.
Syracuse will use the razzle—dazzle of
sophomore guard Dwayne “Pearl”
Washington and the delicated shooting
touch of Rafael Addison to mount its
charge. The other five members of the Big
East —— Boston College, Connecticut, Pitt-
sburgh, Providence and Seton Hall — just
don’t have the players to fight for the top
division.

Harriers prepare for Nationals

Cohesiveness between the two teams is
also a factor that has aided the athletes
during the season and will again work to
their advantage this weekend. The
members of both teams are both extremely
supportive and respectful of each other, as
well as overjoyed at their mutual success.

“This is truly a first, having both teams
from the university qualify for the Na-
tionals," commented Muncic. “it's
something very unusual; not many schools
have ever sent two teams."

Workouts during the week have bccn
similar for the two teams; they have tap-
pered off a bit from the tuorc rigorous
practices of the preceding weeks, however.

“it’s been a long season,” commented
Clements, “and this was our most impor
tant week. There's really no reason to
hammer yourself now."

White’s attitude echoed that of
Clements. “The money's in the bank and
now we’re drawing on the interest. This
Saturday, we'll be running on the fumes."

984: A year of ups and downs for'the Danes

y Marc Berman

R13 EDITOR

He is looking a little less strained and
ppearing a bit more relaxed this past
eek. Albany State football coach Bob
ord usually does when he is released of
» e pressures of a lO-game schedule.

The days are now spent behind his desk
the football office, instead of on the
ractice field. it is the time of year when
oach Ford invites each player into his
emoribilia-filled office for a one-on-one
at. The focus of the 30-minute meeting
sually centers on the player‘s past perfor-
. ance and future goals.

- The hours are long for Ford; he starts
nducting the meetings at 8 am. and they
a good part into the night. He did find
: few minutes out of his harried schedule
1;. reflect on the season as a whole.

  
  
    
   
    
  
  
  
    
  
      
    
  
    
  
   
    
    
     
 
   
     
    
     
  
  
  
  
  
   
 
 
 
  
      
    
    
   
  
   
  
  
 
 
   
  
 
    
  
      

“if you told me at the beginning of the
ason we'd finish at 5-5, i guess i
t ouldn't be too pleased," said Ford. "But
in not dissatisfied. At one point during
ic season, we were looking into the barrel
another 3-7 season."
To say the Danes had a rugged schedule
ould imply a gross understatement. it
ight be debated, but many Division iii
bscrvers feel Albany State had the tnost
crfui schedule in Division 111.
The Danes lost five games this season,
hree of those coming against Division 11
chools. Their other two defeats came vcr-
us two nationally-ranked Division 111
chools, (9-1) Hoi‘stra and (9-1) Norwich.
All season. Ford spoke of their for-
idable schedule, but he always backed
he decision to play Division Ii schools.
Ford has said that he wants to play as
any strong teams as possible. He feels he
rould be cheating his players if it was done
i)iny other way.
“We killed Maris! last week," Ford
aid, “and i was standing in the locker
ootn after the game, and i was thinking to
yseif what the hell did we accomplish out
here today."
Some Division ill coaches did not con-
r with Ford's philosophy. The coach of
ofstra (a school noted for their weak
hcdnle), Mickey Kwiatkowski, com-
entcd on the Danes’ difficult schedule a
few weeks ago saying: “They’re a Division
i school. i don’t know why they play
ivision 11 schools."
There will be some adjustments to next
ar's slate. The Danes are scheduled
ainsl two Division 11 schools instead of
ree; New Haven, winners ovcr Albany
-7 in the second game of the season, was
. e team dropped.

Also wiped off next year's slatc arc the
Marist Red Foxes, the school Albany
smashed last week 43-0.

The only addition to next year‘s
schedule will be RPi, a novice football
program compared to Albany State. Ford
and his staff are still searching for a team
to plug the gap in their schedule.

ironically, the Danes' problems started
after their biggest victory of the season. in
the opener. Albany topped the perennial
Division 111 power ithaca Bombers, 10-6.
it was the last game lthaca would lose all
season.

During the Dunes' bittersweet victory,
ithaca's Ail-American nose tackle Bill
Shcerin tackled starting junior quarter-
back Mike Milano by grabbing hold of his
ankle. it turned into being the last play of
Milano's season as he was driven off the
field in a motorized cart, wincing in pain
from his broken fibula.

Sophomore Anthony Nozzi was named
the starting quarterback, but he lost his
position as quickly as he gained it.

Jeff Russell was tabbed the starter,
becoming only the second freshman

quarterback to start in the history of (Trent
Dunc football.

The Great Dane quarterback dilcmna
lessened as the season wore on, but Ford
wished he weren’t put in the position of
having to start a freshman quarterback.

“He learned so much this season," said
Ford, "but i just wish he would‘ve learned
it on the J.V.."

With Milano eagerly awaiting his return
next year, there is already speculation ofa
huge quarterback war in this summer's
training camp.

“We’ll have to see how Mike recovers
from his ankle," said Ford. “There will
definitely be a quarterback battle."

Milano said he was encouraged by
fullback Dave Soldini, who broke his
fibula last year but recovered this year to
break the school-single-season rushing
record.

“it gives me inspiration to see Soldini
come back from the same injury 1 have
and break the record," said Milano.

Whoever the quarterback is, the Danes
will no doubt have a potent wishbone at-
tack. Soldini, who gained 1017 yards in

 

breaking Tom DeBlois' 1975 record, will
be joined by sephomore Ro Mitchell and
junior Dana Me1vin.

Mitchell wound up the season averaging
seven yards a carry after seeing limited ac-
tion in the first part of the year.

One of the key problems offensively this
year has been the'turnover. The Danes
committed an average of 5.6 miscues a
game. One interesting statistic: out of the
43 Albany fumbles, 40 of them were lost.

Thfe offensive line play was solid all
season. Led by senior Tom Jacobs,
possibly the best lineman in Dane history.
Albany was able to dominate the line of
scrimmage in most games. John Sawchuck
was another powerful force on the right
sidc of the line. Sawchuck, who has a year
of eligibility left, might be back next
season if he opts to attend graduate
school.

Dcfensively, the Danes were stingy
against the run,but their secondary play
was spotty at times.

One-half of the secondary will be
graduating: Ray Priore and Jimmy
Collins.

Freshman Robbin Williams is cxpccted
to fill the role at safety along with another
freshman, Kerry Carrol.

The Danes will surely miss two veteran
dcfcnscmcn: linebacker Jim Valentino and
defcnsivc tackle Joint Redmond.

“John played injured a good part of his
career," said Ford. “He's had an outstan-
ding career with us. Valentino first started
as a corner and he’s probably a better cor-
ncr than a linebacker, but we needed him
there. He had a great year."

The rest of the defense looks solid for
ncxt season. Sophomore safety Wayne
Anderson accounted for half of Albany's
lﬁ interceptions.

Freshman defensive lineman Chris
Esposito impressed the coaches with his
knack for the pass rush. Another
freshman, Gerry Ford, was touted as a top
prospect, but he is planning to transfer
next season to Hofstra or St. John's.

Two words that have not been used in
Ford’s vocabulary these past two seasons
are "NCAA playoffs.” He still refuses to
boldly predict a playoff berth next season.

“We do have a lot of players back,"
said Ford, “but these are players returning
from a 5-5 team. Every year the goal is the
playoffs; if we could limit our injuries
tnaybc we can do it."

is Ford glad the season is over?

“Heck no," said the only football coach
Albany has ever had, “i wish thc season
could last all year."
