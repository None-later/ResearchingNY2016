Explosion kills so .

‘ Mexico City
(AP) A series of explosions at a natur'al gas
processing complex triggered a huge ﬁre
Monday in the suburb of the Mexican
capital, devastating a densely populated
residential area. Authorities said at least 80
people were killed and more than 550
seriously injured.

Mexico State Governor Alfredo dcl
Mazo said in a live television interview, “A
little more tltan 80 people have perished
and there than 300 were injured."

Red Cross and police rescue workers,
setting up first aid facilities in a subway
station and a church in the poor, crowded
city of Tlalnepantia on the northeast out-
skirts ofthe Mexican capital, said at least
550 people had been treated for serious
injuries.

Witnesses reported the fires broke out
immediately after one large explosion
followed by perhaps a dozen others. The
fires, which sent plumes of smoke rising a
mile into the air, were still burning four
hours after the first explosions.

SAT exams mutilated

New York
(AP) The US. Postal Service has
mutilated the answer sheets to 197
Scholastic Aptitude Tests, sending
students into new paroxystns of pre-test
anxiety and adminisn‘ators scttttiing to ur-
range make-ups.

Students “want to know what’s going to
happen. They're scared,“ Walter Harris,
principal of Sheepsltcad Bay High School
in Brooklyn, said Monday.

Harris learned this tnontlt that
somewhere between Brooklyn attd the post
office in Newark, N.J., the answer sheets
for all 197 SAT's given at his school on
November 3 were ruitted.

It apparently was the first time lest
answers were damaged in the mail, out oi‘
l.5 million SAT's and 6 million tests ol' all
types administered each year by the Educa-
tional Testing Service, said ETS
spokeswoman Joy McIntyre.

Sta "Sm" t(=19'etorces'escort service  

 

By Beth Flnneran
STAFF WRITER ,

The “Don't Walk Atonc'"
Escort Service cut back its opera-
tions to include only service from
the library to points on the up-
town campus last week.

Tuesday night captain Andrew
Gelbman said the stations on the
four uptown quads, which had
been based in the tower lobbies,
were phased out because they
weren't being used and because
the escorts could be better used at
the library post.

However, "Don’t Walk
Alone" coordinator Rochelle
Hirschenson said that despite the
problems, "overall tltittgs arc go-
ing pretty good" as the new ser-
vice wraps up its first semester.

“The volunteers that par-
ticipate are great," site said, bttt
“Don't Walk Alone" could use
"more response front the Univer-
sity as a wltole," site added.

Donna Capoddacq‘ua, a
Women’s Studies major and
former member of the President’s
Task Force on Women’s Safety
served as an escort on State Quad
before tlte cut-back. She said she
feels the two biggest problems the
service faces are publicity and stu-
dent attitudes. While quad escorts
were located in tower lobbies,
Capodacqua said, “most people
think we're waiting for pizza.”

In addition, she said, some
students feels they‘re being a “big
baby" if they ask for an escort.
“Many students see safety as a
joking issue," she added. Yet,
site said that when site served on
the President’s Taks Force she
saw a growing list of crimes be
committed against women.

Fe/dman resigns post on eve of SA investigation

 

By Tom Bergen
sun: unnmt

As Studcttt Association was preparing
last week to investigate the management of
Speaker’s Forum, Ricky Feldman, the
group’s cltair handed itt his resignation,
according to SA officials.

Altltouglt Feldman told grottp members
that he was resigning for personal reasons
and becattse he would be unable to devote
enough time to his dtttics as chair, ques-
tions retttaitt concerning his management
tactics and his handling of the group’s
finances.

Feldman resigned on November l2,
amidst dissension itt the group and sharp
criticism from SA officials.

According to SA Controller Rich
Golubow. “they (Speaker's Forum) were
not sending in vouchers and receipts on

time  this is a large progratntttittg group
and we entrust them with approximately
$20,000 of SA money.”

In addition, said Golubow, “people in
the group were not very happy with the
operation of the group. All tlte power was
in the hands of a few people."

One particularly sticky dispute between
SA and Speaker’s Forum, which remains
unresolved, concertth a voucher Feldman
gave to the Albany Strident Press bttsittess
office to pay for a Speaker's Forum ad.

The vottcher had Golubow's initials on
it, but according to Golubow, “my initials
were forged and it wasn’t anyone in SA, it
had to be someone within the group."

SA Programming Director Patty Salkin
asserted, “Ricky (Fcldman) said he didn't
sigtt it, (SA President Rich) Schaffcr did.
Schaffer says he didn't sign it because he

would use his own initials, ttot Golubost.
We don’t know who signed it, it may ltave
been Ricky, or it may not have been
Ricky."

Feldntan contended, “The ASP
deadline for Tuesday advertising is Friday
tteeded Golubow's

democratically. “There were questions,”
Salkin said, “as to whether all speakers
and speakers’ expenses were voted on,
there have been no minutes kept from
September to mid-0ctober"of the group's
meetings.

“My initials were forged... it had to be
someone within the group.”

On Alumni Quad, screaming is a group activity

By Christopher Blomqulst
EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

It's 8:58pm at Alumni Quad's
Waterbury Hall. The virt tally
silent air is suddenly overcome by
a communal AAAHHHHHH!

People are not being molested
or dismembered. it's time for

   

 

primal screams.

This nightly event, which
originated in Waterbury Hall's
basement section, or “The Pit,"
is now pretty much accepted by
downtown residents, but its
founders hope to popularize it
across the entire SUNYA campus.

Primal screamers in Waterbury Hell
"it (the primni sen-ant) is almost bigger rimn all of us"

Already, screams can be heard
out of other downtown halls.
The origin of the screams is a
debatable issue. John Aspen and
his roommate Joe Gilqu say they
were the first to yell out the win-
dows. “I used to scream
‘ALBANY SUCKSI’ out at win-

 
  

CINDV OALWAV UPS

dow during the first week of
school,” said Aspen, adding that
the idea just caught on with the
rest of “The Pit.”

According to Ken Hochhauser,
“it was us who started the Primal
Scream." "It started in The Pit
bathroom yelling out the win-
dow,” he added.

But the issue of the origin of
the scream is not of much concern
to Waterbury residents. They are
now more concerned with getting
a hearty, unified scream every
night.

The primal screaming original-
iy began at I 1:00pm, but this was
a violation of quiet hours, and a
first floor .Resldent Assistant
threatened to refer the screeamers
to Judicial Board. To prevent
this, and continue the scream, the
“Pitsers” decided to change the
time.

“At first, nobody liked it at
“:00, so we changed it to just
before 9:00. We weren’t violating
quiet hours and they had to live
with it," explained George Ser-
rano, who is generally regarded
by the “Pit” residents as the best
screamer. .

“When I'm ltere attd I go out
there I pretty much let my frustra-

tions out. I go out there at two
minutes to 9:00 and let it out with
the rest of the fellows. It's great,"
he said. Serrano said his ROTC
training has helped him maintain
such a powerful scream.

Serrano added that his plans
for moving uptown in January
have changed, due in some part to
the primal screams. "We’re like a
little family," Serrano said.

On weekends, the screamers
march about Alumni's center
courtyard screaming while wear-
ing only their underwear. They
have added a bugle that plays
"Charge!" and use a construc-
tion cone that serves as a
megaphone. Sometimes they in—
corporte a “Beer Wave" into the
weekend routine and scream and
wave empty mugs.

“The Pitsers" have also held a
Primal Scream Party in their
lounge. “It (the primal scream) is
almost bigger than all of us,"
stated "Pit" R.A. Greg Sharer.

“Pit” residents also made
flyerts and computer signs that re
quested the rest of the quad to
join in.

They explained that someone
