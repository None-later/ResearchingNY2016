According to Kennedy, who
earlier this year won the Pulitzer
Prize for his novel, lronweed
holding the premiere in Albany
was SUNYA President Vincent
O‘Leary's idea. Kennedy added,
“it is a pretty big event, i cannot
remember the last time we had a

think we ever did."

Trinity institute Director Ruby

The premiere, hich will be

followed by a dinner and recep-
tion at the Albany Hilton, was
organized by the New York State
Writer's Institute, which Kennedy
heads. “The Writer’s institute is
sponsoring the film (premiere),”
Kennedy said, “but is taking no
money from it."
Kennedy said Cuomo is serving as
co-chair of the event because “He
is a friend of mine, but it is his
town, too.”

Cuomo spokesperson Madeline
Lewis said the governor will at-
tend “because he is a supporter of
Kennedy and the Writer's in-
stitute. The governor wants to
show his support for the cultural
life of Albany and the state, and
the programs which encourage
it...

 

Speaking of Cotton Club, Ken.
nedy said. “it is a lively film, 1
think Coppola did a remarkably
good job of integrating the
gangster angle and the musical-
comedy together.”

Co-writing the movie was, Ken-
nedy said, the realization of a life.
long interest. “it was great sport,
i had a good time." he explained,
adding, “i learned a great deal
about scriptwriting and i got to
know a good many people in the
business.”

Although he expected to spend
only a few months working on the
script, “it turned into a year‘s
work," Kennedy said.

Coppola's latest film, One
From the Heart, nearly left the
director in bankruptcy, while
Apocalypse Now recouped its
production costs. Even though
Coppola went over budget with
Cotton Club, Kennedy said, “i
hope the people who put the
money get it back, that will be dif-
ficult because it was an expensive
film.”

Kennedy said he thinks the film
will be a commercial success, ex-
plaining, “beyond being commer-
cial, it says some good things
about the world we live in."

Kennedy has been widely ac-
claimed for his books including
Oh Albany], Legs, and Billy
Phelan's Greatest Game. in addi-
tion, Albany celebrated
September as “William Kennedy
Month" following a proclama~
tion by Cuomo declaring the
holiday.

computing head’s exit

By Leslie Chalt

STAFF WRITER

Several administrators have received new titles and responsibilities
in a recent telecommunications and information systems department
shufﬂe in the wake of the resignation of the director of the Corn—

puting Center.

The administrative reorganization was necessary due to the resigna-
tion of Director of the Computing Center, Barbara Wolfe and the
movement of Dr. Frank Lees from Associate Vice President for
Academic Affairs to Associate Vice President for information
Systems, said Acting Director of institutional Research Wendell

Lorang.

Leif Hartmark, former Director of Planning, will take over as ac-
ting Director of the Computing Center.

Vice President for Research and Development, Dr. John Shumakcr
said the reorganization went into effect October 23. “Personnel shifts
are important but the reorganization of central computing is also im-

portant," he said.

'According to Harry Hamilton, now the sole Associate Vice Presi-
dent of Academic Affairs, Lees’ new duties will be “consolidating
various' pieces of technological revolutions around campus.”

Hamilton said his workload will increase but he said he doesn't see
it as “impossible or even stressful. i believe i can manage." He added
that one advantage to the shift is that there will be one person handl—
ing resources and undergraduate programs.

' According to Shumaker, a result of the shift would be “better scr-
vtccs for students,'and faculty will be coordinating and using our
resources more creatively and efficiently than in the past."

' Hamilton also mentioned a disadvantage to the reorganization say-
ing that although he feels the office .will be able to carry ottt its
necessary functions, the time needed to consider academic issues such
as curriculum development and honors programs might be “short

changed."

_ “What this will mean is that i will try to get more faculty involved
tn considering these matters." he said.

Lorang. commented on the shift, saying, “i think we (the “d”
ministration) have got a continuation of a management team who will
work together effectively and efficiently," adding. “l’m looking for-
ward to serving as acting director and working with these pCOP'C i”
tlteirnew positions. 1 see it as a positive move."

New Director of Planning Pat Tcrenzini said. “All the titl-
mtntstrators involved in these shifts know the responsibilities thc)""c
gorng to have," adding, “people will notice no diminution in thc
quality of service and there may be an improvement." l '

Smokeout enjoys success despite lene

By Noam Eshkar
STAFF WRITER

450 smokers took advantage of
the Great American Smokeout
last Thursday at SUNYA, but one
person was so angered by the
event he staged a “smoke-in”
outside the Campus Center and
offered free cigarettes to passers-
by.

The smokeout, sponsored na-
tionwide by the American Cancer
Society, was directed by the Tau
Kappa Epsilon fraternity at
SUNYA.

“it went a lot better than i ex-

pected it to,” said Barry Pollock,
president of Tau Kappa Epsilon.
At least 450 smokers and 300 non-
smoking ‘adopters’ participated
in the twenty-four hour anti-
smoking campaign, based at a
table in the Campus Center,"
Pollock said.

“The best part of the event was
that it gave smokers who put if
off a chance to quit,” he said.

Not everyone agreed with the
idea of a smokeout. Peter Jones,
a SUNYA frosh who handed out
free cigarettes in a protest outside
the Campus Center, said that he

tional Peace Research institute in

Speaking as a guest in the
SUNYA President’s Lecture
Series, Young said that peace
movements "have a tradition go-
ing back 180 years and have failed
in all kinds of ways,"_ by not
preventing wars or banning par-
ticular weapons.

Casting them “new breed”
peace movements, Young spoke
of "single issue‘peace groups"
that have united since 1979.

Young said he feels that the
United States “ is ignorant of the
European people on the side of
the peace movements,” and that
“new constituencies have been
activated" against further build-
ups of nuclear weapons.

The European movement has
“moved beyond anti-US. feel-
ings” and has been “less aligned
with pro-Soviet Communism,”
Young said, calling the idea of
non-alignment “very exciting."
He added that the movement, has
been associated exclusively with

smokers” who infringe on the
personal rights of smokers by
pressuring them to quit.

“We put in hours of work to

and that guy just went out and
made a mockery of it — it's
ridiculous," Pollock said. He also
objected to the handing out of
free cigarettes, saying that Jones
was “really proud that he got two
people who had filled out forms
(to quit) to smoke — he shoved
the cigarettes in their faces —— i
wouldn’t be too proud of that."

SA court finds new Council budget illegal

L: cgrm‘ 

By llene Welnsteln
EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

When Central Counciland a member of Student
Association found themselves at odds over finance
policy last week they turned to SA’s Supreme Court

to resolve the dispute.

After » a hearing Sunday night, -the court
unanimously ruled in favor of the executive, SA

Controller Rich Golubow, who
said Central Council could not
appropriate its new budget direct~
ly from SA's general fund, but
must take its funds from Coun-
cil's emergency spending line

(ESL), as do all groups seeking funding after SA’s
budget has been approved for the academic year.
Asserting that two statutes in SA‘s finance policy
are “very vague," the court ruled that Central
Council’s new $1,100 budget, which Council
allocated from the general fund on November 14,
would have to come from the ESL, a $10,000 ac-
count that SA usually uses to give groups additional
money or fund new groups during the academic

year.

The general fund is money not budgeted to any
particular group, and is made up primarily of
surplus funds from previous years.

According to statutc 904.15 of SA’s finance
policy, all new or additional appropriations must be
taken from the ESL. But Statute 906.2 of the policy
states that “any appropriation from 'the General
Fund shall be submitted to Central Council as a bill
and must be approved by a two-thirds majority.

Part of the dispute centers around differing opi-_
nions as to the purpose of the ESL. Central Council
Chair Mitch Feig claimed that the ESL should only
be used for SA groups, while Golubow contended
that all extra funds allocated during the year should
be taken from the ESL, until the account is at zero,
at which time Council can reallocate money from

the general fund to the ESL.

Allocating funds from the ESL, explained Feig,
who spoke before the court on council’s behalf,

Golubow, who argued his own point before the
court, asserted, it is “unsound fiscal policy to use
money from the General Fund" when the ESL has
a budget of $10,000 created for emergencies. “SA
does not have the power to go to the General Fund
for just any reason," he added.

Court will strongly recommend

that SA's finance policy should be “reworked” to

opposition to the Pershing and
Cruise mlssles since 1979, but that
a European “nuclear free zone"
had been their broader goal.

The new movement, according
to‘Young, has placed less_em-
phasis on parties and political in-
volvement, and more on mass ap-
peal. “There is a community
base,” Young said, adding that
many localized nuclear free zones
now exist in Europe, voted into
place by local citizens.

The most significant peace
movement in Europe, according
to Young, is in Germany where
there is a “broad based appeal
and program as no other peace
group has done."

Young added that peace resear-
cher and educators have “been
more signiﬁcant today and have
made a difference,” because
education “is part of the
movement."

Using a variety of graphs and
diagrams, Young showed what he
called the “peaks and troughs” of
peace movement activity. Calling

Jones insisted that he and the
smoke-in were misunderstood.
“The point was that we wanted to
offer people a chance to smoke as
the Society offered them not to,”
he said, adding,“We weren’t for-
cing anyone — we were offer-
ing."

Jones also denied “shoving
cigarettes” at anyone. “The two
people who smoked did so out of
personal choice,” he said.

Claiming that he was harassed
at his dorm, Jones also said he
received an insulting phone call in
his suite, by someone who

ture in history," Young described
the “shattered sense of humani-
ty" that had to be re—estabiished

“across the trenches" following
that ‘war.

.Despite the “primitive na:
tionalism" of Margaret That-
cher's Falkland’s War or the Con-
servative policies of Germany’s
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Young
said that a uniﬁed peace move-
ment has emerged in Europe.

Two aspects of that uniﬁed
movement have been “transna-
tionalism" and “unilateralism.”

Transnationalism, Young said,
has created .a “common move-
ment across national borders.
Their (other nations') struggles
are our struggles," he said, ad-
ding that the new movement has
involved more than one nation
and more than one tradition.

Unilateralism, Young said, has
not been popular to US. decision
makers. He termed a unilateral
peace offering as “a call for
reciprocity" by both sides of a
conflict.

resented the smoke-in.

Pollock said he spoke politely
to Jones at his dorm, but that he
knew nothing about any insulting
phone messages.

“i think he's (Jones) an in-
secure person looking for atten-
tion," Pollock said

Tau Kappa Epsilon, the spon-
sor of the smoke-out, is a nation-
wide social fraternity whose
charter was passed at SUNYA on-
ly a few weeks ago. Charity and
social events are an important
part of the fraternity, Pollock
said.
