Injunctlon denled

A motion for a preliminary injunction
to suspend the bus fee'was denied on Mon-
day, November 5. according to a
spokesperson from Judge Lawrewnce
Kahn’s ofﬁce.

A preliminary injunction refers to SA's
request that the administration suspend
the bus fee before the case was heard., “it's
a way of winning the case before it
begins,” explained SA attorney Lewis
Oliver.

Oliver said that “we will do a certain
amount of discussing and we will make a
summary (final) judgement." He
suspected that SA would begin pro-
ceedings for a new case sometime in the
near future. -

When asked why Judge Kahn took two
months to reach his decision, Oliver
replied. “Most judges take from four to
eight weeks. This was not an unusual mat-
ter at all."

Comedian considered

Controversial comedian John Valby
may not come to SUNYA until late next
semester. if ever. according to Michenc
Ketcham, President of Class of ‘86. The
Class of '86 Council is considering the idea"
of sponsoring Valby after Colonial Quad
Board voted not to bring him to campus,

The ’86 Class Council' will vote on
whether to bring Valby to SUNYA by the
end of this semester or by the beginning or
next semester, said Keteham.

“The council is split on whether to bring
him," said Ketcham, adding that the cost
to host Valby, estimated at $3.500-4000.
not including hotel or transportation costs,
is an obstacle.

“We don’t want to lose money.“ said
Ketcham, noting that the ’86 Class (‘otui-
cil's only income is from dues and that br-
inging Valby may be too expensive.
