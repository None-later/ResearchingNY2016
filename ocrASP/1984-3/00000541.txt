I tist. l belong to several groups that
are against the arms buildup and

US. intervention in Central America. i
worked in a refugee center for Nicaraguan
refugees during the Sandinist civil war. l
support government control in 'most

aspects of the economy and a vast social ,

,welfare network. l am considering im-
migration to an lsraeli kibbutz to be able to

live in al'socialistic society. l c0nsistently I
vote De’r‘nocr'atic butam sympathetic to.

many of the leftist fringe parties. a.

i am also a feminist. l support ERA. i

believe that if there must be a draft women

should be drafted and share the burden of .

combat duty. l am in a graduate program
dominated by men. i don't wear makeup. i

call men for dates and l insist on paying my _

own way.
lam also very against the right to choose
abortion. l belong to six different pro-life
organizations. 1 am very active in Bir-
thright, a service organization to enable
women in crisis pregnancies to give birth
to their children and also in the fight
against the proposed abortion center in
Planned Parenthood on Lark Street.

A contradiction? i hope not.

Until perhaps five years ago i thought
that abortion was acceptable until maybe
the third month of pregnancy. After‘
carefully studying the biological and
physiological evidence however, i was
forced to change my mind.

At one month, about the time a woman
knows that she is pregnant, the fetus
already has the beginning of a heart and
brain waves. At two months the heart is
fully functioning and manufactures its own
blood, it can twitch, and between 8 to 10
weeks it can move its limbs independently.
Brain structure will be complete by 12
weeks.

But by only 7 weeks it can be determin-
ed by a microscope whether it is male or
female. it has all its major organs, limbs,
fingers. and toes, it is possible that it can
already see a little, it certainly can feel
pain.

By 12 weeks there will be no difference
between a fetus and a newborn infant ex-
cept in size and in the ability to breathe air.

To me this biological evidence is very
compelling. in fact, the head of the local
group of Feminists for Life has a masters
degree in physiology and has taught
embyology.

Apart from the development argument
however, there is also the' dependency
argument. Some argue that a fetus is not a
child if it must be dependent on another
living organism. However, when the em-
bryo was first implantedin the womb the
mother's body developed antibodies
against it; it was considered a foreign
substance. An embryo can be transplanted
in another woman's womb and develop in
a test tube. Until about [00 years ago
newborn babies were dependent on their
mother or another woman's body for
nourishment. Were they then not fully
persons? in about 20 years fetuses will be
able to be incubated outside women's
bodies altogether so they will no longer
have to be dependent at all on a women’s
body. if the criterion for defining whether
a fetus is a person therefore is whether or
not he is "dependent" will fetuses become
“people” when technology improves?

if there is still any doubt however since
killing people, especially babies, is so
serious, isn't it better to err on the side of
caution? if we were driving on a dark rainy
night and we saw something moving across
the road that we thought might possibly be
a person. wouldn’t we do everything possi-
ble to avoid hitting it?

I know that many believe that this is a
personal decision. However, when a
woman's actions affect a third person.
namely her baby, it becomes my business.
The woman who has an abortion is depriv-
ing me and my children of the contribution
that child can make‘to my society. Who

fluence and how many lives he will change
for the better? Leonardo da Vinci, Sophia
Loren, Willy Brandt and Mahalia Jackson
were all born out of wedlock. Y

When l worked in that refugee center in
Costa Rica i met some pregnant unwed
women. some younger than university
age, who never considered abortions even

 

though they were bombed out of their
homes and were hungry. Although living

conditions in certain areas of Southeast

Asia and Africa are incredibly awful the
birthrate is very high, as it is in most im-
proverished countries. Abortion would
seem the logical alternative. Yet it is rarely
considered although it is available. Why? t
know that for the women in the refugee
center having children was an affirmation
that in spite of political and social systems
that oppressed them and considered them
superfluous, they had a right to exist and
perpetuate themselves. They were not go-
ing to buy into the mentality of their en-
vironment which was telling them to give
up and cop out.

Many university students have abor-
tions because they do not want to "mess up
their lives". it is just not “acceptable” to
bear a child out of wedlock in a "middle
class” environment. They must get their
degrees on time (not that pregnancy and
child bearing will necessarily prevent this)
and continue in a profession following the
time table set out for them by society.

But by aborting a child a university stu-

Confessions Of An Anti—Choice Feminist

_ by Sharon Long

 

Many also believe that if so many peo-
ple do it then abortion really can’t be so
terrible. if so many people agree that it is
o.k. then abortion really can't be killing a
baby. During WWll scholars legitimately
debated whether Jews were subhuman or
an inferior race. Nazi propaganda con-
tinually protrayed Jews as subhuman ver-
min. When people saw the government
rounding up Jews they may have thought
that if so many were deporting Jews then
maybe they are really subhuman after all
and do not deserve to live.

Today prejudices, discrimination, and
apartheid exist because many people who
may privately have doubts are willing to
put them aside because they see that others
exploit Blacks and the government
legitimizes it. if everybody does it, and the
government says it's o.k. then it must be
o.k. it is easy under these circumstances to
believe that Blacks really are inferior.

. Slavery lasted so long in this country for

the same reason but with an added twist —' '
the institution of slavery was rationalized '

so that advocates believed that slavery was
actually good for the slaves! Slavery
“protected” Blacks from "economic ex-
ploitation" hunger, and unemployment in
the free labor market which was believed
to be unable to absorb Blacks. Given the
economic structure, it was rationalized,
slavery had to be permitted; there was no
choice.

 

 

 

knows how many people he/she will in- ’

. . .abortion damages women. When a
'woman has an abortion, she is killing a part
of herself. She is killing something that is
beautiful and awesome and was created out

of her own body.

 

dent is in effect giving into a system which
puts personal achievement and status
ahead of the rights of the individual. A
system which says that if a person cannot
be born under exactly the right conditions
lie/she doesn’t deserve to live; that he/she
would be superfluous and that other peo-
ple born in the "right" circumstances are
more important.

Many people agree with what i am say-
ing but the thought of carrying a child is
very abstract,‘ especially in the first
trimester; a woman cannot feel it yet.
When I read about thousands dead in the
lran/lraqi war. 3 million dead in Cambodia.
or thousands starving in Southern Africa it
doesn't affect me either. it's too abstract l
don't feel it. This does not make their
deaths any less real however. The dif-
ference between man and animal is that
man knows that things are real even if he
cannot feel or see them. Many wonder
'How could the Holocaust have happened?
Why didn't people speak out?’ I don't
wonder. Who spoke out twelve years ago
when we knew the genocide that was oc-
curring in Cambodia? Because we did not
see it with our own eyes it did not seem
real to us. it was easier to ignore what was
happening.

 

, Itth they are alive,

in the same manner abortion is ra-
tionalized as being good for children. it
prevents child abuse. It insures that all
children are raised in "quality" homes. Just
the way it was thought that an employed
slave was better off than an unemployed
free Black so it is thought that a dead child
is better off than an abused child.

This flies in the face of empirical
evidence. Several studies show that bet-
ween 7080 percentage of abused children
were wanted. Experts believe that abuse is
not caused by being unwanted but because
parents become frustrated that their
children cannot fulfill the parents' unmet

emotional needs for which they had‘

wanted the children in the first place. in
spite ot legalized abortion reported child
abuse continues to increase. Other studies
show that the same percentage of planned
and unplanned pregnancies are "wanted"

_ children after birth. Few abused children

commit suicide. Social workers say that
when given a weekend pass from a
children‘s shelter children rush to homes
where they have been abused. In spite of
the‘abuse they find many positive things in
their home environment. To them abuse is
not a fate Worse than death. They are glad

Most importantly. however, abortion
damages women. When a woman has an
abortion she is killing a part of herself She
is killing something that is beautiful and
awesome that was created out of her own
body. Abortion, by completely divorcing
sex from its potential to produce “iv an.
courages the perception of women as
"playthings". Also the objectification of the
fetus, which while not being the totality of
women's sexuality is certainly closely con.
nected to it. increases the objectification of
women as sex objects.

l have never known a woman to have an
abortion because she wishes to exercise her
ideological right to control her own body.
A woman generally has abortion because
she allow_s or is coerced into her body be.
ing controlled by someone else. Abortion
not only encourages the sexual exploita-
tion of women; it solves men's problem. Is
it any wonder that survey after survey
shows that it is white males who are the
most supportive of abortion on demand?

Although the birth of a child docs nut
necessarily strengthen a relationship. alum
tion never does. One study of 400 couples
has shown that 70 percentage of ll‘lt' rela-
tionships break up within a month of the
abortion. Another study had showed that
90 percentage of the relationships break up
within a year after the abortion. When a
couple agrees on abortion they are tlL'nylng
the product of their most intimate sharing.
the product of their union. They ﬂl'l' deny-
ing the validity of their relationship. 'l'liix
coupled with the fact that women llt‘-
quently resent their partners’ lack or sup-
port will quickly erode whatever love and
trust existed in the relationship.

Women Exploited By Abortion
(WEBA). a pro life support group for
women who have had abortions, say that ll
is very common for a woman to have iroii
ble relating to men sexually after an almi-

' tion and to go into depression.

Of course, for abortion to be eliminated
we need much better health tn'slliiliitt‘
policies, flexible working hours, L'il \\'i'
need to develop social attitudes so that
women who are pregnant out of wedloik
are not stigmatized and so that the woman
who does not get her degree and iii-ionic .i
professional on time is not overtly oi
covertly disparaged. We need a sorrvty
where children are truly thought or .i~
blessings, not burdens.

lt continually astounds me that thi- inost
caring and sensitive political activists \\'Ill
work with real determination in spru- or
large obstacles in the support of other
causes but When confronted with the il'dlt-
ty of abortion will at best shake ilit‘ll llt'.|\l\
and say, "Abortion is unfortunate but that s

since these will not be changed in tho short
run we shoulth least keep abortion Nillt'

First, nowadays even illegal .iliiiiiiiiri
will be safe. A woman can take a satr i‘t“
toglandin hormone which will induw l.ibur
and would then be able to go to ilii'
hospital to be legally “scraped out" .'\lw
many trained doctors will C(mllnltt' to pi"-

Why must WC accept things as they an“

Legalized abortion only maintalns lllt‘
status quo, it does nothing to change tliiisi'

MJklnti abortion illegal is not the .insiu’l
but at least it's a first step. The law is .i sym
bol of what society values children and
that no life is superfluous. Perhaps hrriinini:
abortion will force society to examine the

ings such as “No matter where you

get? Knight Rider? Science Fiction?
Zen? No - Buckaroo Banzai and his
adventures in the 8th dirnensionl

 

Keren Schlomy

Earl Mac Rouch. author ofthe book
and screenplay, said in Fantastic
Films magazine, "it's easier to talk
about what the film is not, than about
what it is. it’s not about a punk rock
superhero. it's not about a contem—
porary Renaissance man who can
pick his nose and perform
neurosurgery at the same time. it's
not Star Wars and it’s not Dr.
Strangelove."

Mac Rouch set out to form in-
to resting characters and plot, butap-
parcntly didn’t intend for it to make
total sense. Then again, you're not
supposed to take it seriously.
Remember that. The humor is often
subtle, but it permeates the film. It
starts with .i View of Buckaroo Banzai
(l’cicr Wt‘lll‘i'l helping out his friend
and follow neurosurgeon Dr. Sidney
Zwvibcl (Jr-ii (iolilblum) in surgery.
Goldblum, who you might
remember from The Big Chill, is
about to pull on a nerve. "Don’t tug
on that,” Weller says. "you never
know what it might be attached to."
Thus giving the audience its first
look at the character of Buckaroo.
Within the next five minutes he

reaks the sound barrier with his Jet
car ’which seems to be powered like
the bat mobile), drives through a
mountain into the eighth-dimension,
Jams .. mean rock session in a New
Jersey Bar, and frees a girl from
prison. He is clearly the most well-
developed character of the film and
all the rest lose something in his
presence.

Basically, the earth is caught in a
battle between the good and evil
Lectroids from planet to. The
"good" ones are more than willing to

ting a nuclear war ~ if Buckaroo
doesn’t stop the evil ones in time.
Good or evil, they can all make us
see them as humans, instead of the
slimy creatures they really are. For
some reason, the good aliens all'look
and talk like Jamaicans. Another
characteristic they all share is the
first name John. Even the females.
Tli.ir last names, however, range

from Smallberries and Yoyo, to
Bigboote. More humor. Take it
lightly. .

At one point in the film the evil
aliens are escaping in their
spaceship - but they don't quite and
up where they wanted to go. "This
isn't the nth dimension,” one ex-
claims. "No, its New Jersey," Ap-V
parently there isn't much difference.

Don't worry about the language,
l’olly l’ui‘vbrcd couldn't have dour:
better. With expressions like "l don't
give a flying handshake" and “l'm
holding my fudge" the dialogue pro-
vides another outlet for humor
without being offensive. ‘
Reality? “'5 whatever we choose to
make it. Need a break from the
everyday world of work and pro-

l blcms? Go see Buckaroo Banzai. [fl
