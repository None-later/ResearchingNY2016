A tank at the SUNYAC East

By Marc Berman
SPORTS EDITOR

Potsdam Head Coach Jerry Welsh has
done it again. Just when it looks like
Potsdam might be slipping from their
comfortable perch atop the SUNYAC East.
he puts on his recruiting shirt and lands
three Division I transfers.

Four starters were lost to graduation.
but Welsh has more than adequately
replaced them adding transfer John

Leonard. Brendon Mitchell. and Troy. 1 '
al’

Turner. all from the Capital District area.

With point guard Roosevelt Bullock
ready to turn into an premier player. ac-
cording to Potsdam Sports Information
Director Kevin Williams. Potsdam figures
to once again finish in the top spot of one
of the toughest conferences in Division
ill.

Albany State has four returning starters.
and should return to the SUNYAC
playoffs after a years hiatus.

Binghamton and Plattsburgh are ex-
pected to battle for third. Colonial Head
Coach Dave Archer is still letting his
players race up and down the court like
thoroughbreds.

Oneonta lost all its starters and forgot to
replace them. But they won't finish lower
than Cortland. a team that sported a 1-22
record last season. They will improve. but
not by much.

Potsdam

Jerry Welsh. landed three Division I
transfers. John Leonard. Brendon Mit-
chell. and Troy Turner over the summer.

With Roosevelt Bullock now starting.
Potsdam is solid in every aspect.

On paper. there's no better team in all

of the SUNYACs.
Returning Letterman- Rick Whitney is
the only returning starter. He is 6‘5" and
was second in scoring and rebounding
last season.

Bullock. the sixth man last year. is now
running th offense, He' is everything a
playmaking guard should be: quick, great
penetrator. super passer. and his hands
are as cleft as a magicians.

The two 6'5" transfers. Leonard and
Mitchell. are tall. physical. and love to re-
bound. Leonard sat on the bench at Fair-
field University while Mitchell a grad
from Mount Pleasant. played for North
Carolina MT.

The other transfer. Turner. is rotating
with Tim Horns at the shooting guard
position.

The same players on the bench last year
are still around: 6'6" Ed Okuniewski:
Brooklyn born Barry Stanton, and Shaker
High's Tom Conboy.

Players lost- Four starters. former All-
American guard Leroy Litherspoon. Scott
Culler. Marty Groginski. and Pat
Crawford have said bye-bye to Maxey
Hall. Witherspoon. trying out for the
CBA's Albany Patroons. was cut last
night. ,

Strengths- Potsdam is potent in every
department. They have dominating re-
bounders. quick guards] quick forwards.
and a super bench. Their defense is ag-
gressive: look for Bullock to come up with
a bunch of steals.

Their bench couldn't be deeper. Welsh

has IO players that can play and he
doesn't hesitate to use them.
Weaknesses- Possibly their only weak
point. is shooting beyond the Iii-foot
mark.
Versus Albany- In one of the most
nailbiting games in their historic rivalry.
Albany and Potsdam slugged It out at the
University Gym in front of a full house
with the Danes the winner in overtime
62-56.

In their other meeting earlier in the
season, Potsdam broke open a close game
midway through the second half and won
by a landslide.

Expectations They will finish on top
unless there are detrimental injuries or
some amazing upsets. Welsh won't bold-
ly say it. but he never does.
Prediction-First

Binghamton

There will be a few new faces. but
Binghamton will still be running and gun-
ning with the same amount of consisten-
cy as last season. I

In Coach Dave Archer's initial season.
the Colonials speeded to a 16-10 clip
which was one of the best seasons in re-
cent history for them. All-SUNYAC Derek
Pankey and Spider Pollard are no longer
dressing in a Colonial uniform. but
Binghamton still looks tough this season.
Returning Lettermen- Three out of five
starters are back. 6'6" senior center Mary
Young, senior guard Greg Flaming. and
senior forward Derek Harrison. Senior
guard Caspar Ellis. a reserve last season.
will also start along with transfer Torn
Coleman.

But the key to Binghamton is their deep
bench, which allows them to run. run.

. run without tiring at the finish. The two

key reserves include two 6'6" forwards.
Steve Andrieath, a transfer. and Mike
Schuman, a member of Junior varsity last
season.

Senior Maurice Salama. who as a spot
starter. will provide pressure defense off
the bench.

Players iost- Besides Pankey. the tenth
player in the nation in rebounds. and
Spider Pollard. the career assist leader.
the Colonials lost a very promising
freshman ln Mark Wright. He transferred
to NYU.

Strenghs- This team will run the ball
down your throat and are able to because
of their long bench. They're quick. fast.
and Archer is a prophet with the fast-
break offense. With Young and Harrison
clearing the boards. the outlet pass
should become a common thing for

’ Binghamton basketball.

Experience is also a factor: four out of
the five starters are seniors.
Weaknesses- Archer points out that
Binghamton is not comfortable with the
slow down game. That might prove costly
in the closing moments of a tight game.
Versus Albany- They met three times last
year. During the regular. Albany was
triumphant on Binghamton’s home court
and vice-versa. In the opening round of
the ECACs. Binghamton got the last
laugh. beating the Danes at the buzzer.
Expectations- They should battle Albany
for second place.

"We‘re as good as last year." said Ar-
cher. "I want to be better."
Prediction-Third

Plattsburgh- Detailed information
unavailable.
Prediction-Fourth

Oneonta

Last year's SUNYAC playoff qualifiers
will be "starting from scratch." says
Oneonta's Coach Don Flewelling.

Oneonta was decimated by graduation.
losing all of last season's starting five. The
departure of All-Everything Mike Pocyn-
tyluk will hurt the most. In his fou'r years
as a Dragon. Pocyn tyluk broke every scor-
ing and rebounding record the school
could offer.

This year's squad Is compromised of
zero seniors. two Juniors. five sophmores.
and four freshman. They are not likely to
reproduce last car's 16-10 record. which
was enough or second place in the
Division.

Returning letterman- The only returnees
from last year's unit are sophmore point
guard Tom Combs and junior forward Al
Bishop. two players who received limited
duty. This season. the 6'4" Bishop is ex-
pected to be a malor force inside along
with two 6'6" novices. freshman Steve

 

 

 

 

 

   
  

Boumfield and forward Randy Irons, a
sohpmore who out his freshman with a
busted knee. Coach Fleweiling is hoping
Irons has not lost the mobility he used to
possess.

A Schenectady product and Bishop Gib-
bons grad. Jimmy Johnson. will start at
the other guard. Off the bench look for
freshman Brian Croutier. brother of
Albany State guard Danny Croutier: to
supply some punch. if not this season.
surely in the years to come.

Key losses- Each member of the starting
five averaged double figures. but now
they all have departed. Beside Pocyn-
tyluk. freshman John Ebanks will be sore-
ly missed. He dropped out of school
because of personal problems, according
to Flewelling. Guard Danny Bagan, Steve
Campbell, and 6'6" forward Charlie
Stroud are the other lost members of last
year's playoff team.

Strengths- They've got a tall starting
front line that averages 6‘5“. They also
have a positive attitude. according to
Flewelling. and plenty of enthusiasm.
characteristic of a young squad.
Weaknesses- Inexperience is the key.

There are no seniors and the team con- ‘

tains nine underclassmen. The bench is
also very questionable.

Versus Albany- The Red Dragons dealt
the final blow to Albany State's SUNYAC
playoff aspirations. In the final conference
game of the season. Oneonta rudely
defeated Albany to deny the Danes
playoff berth.

Expectations- Flewelling is a super coach
and usually finds a way to win. But the
odds are stacked against him. He readily
admits it. "What are there. six teams?" he
asked rhetorically. “We‘ll probably finish
sixth."

Prediction: Fifth

Cortland

Coach Bill Williams does not want to
talk about last season.

When asked about the players he lost
from last year's dreadful 1-22 season, be
snapped: "Don't talk to me about last
year. Ifyou want to talk to me. it has to be
about this year."

Coach Williams is expecting his club to
climb back to respectability. He has his
power forward returning. Mike Stokes.
who averaged 24 points a game.

After that. Williams' team is comprised
of a number of transfers and first year
players.
Returning Letterman- Geoff Houston
and Dave Wilson are returning from last
year's dismal club. but the are presently

urt. Houston is expecte to return se-
cond semester.

Al Scott. a freshman. will start at guard
Joined by Bill Bowe a transfer from Alfred
Tech. Junior Dave McCurity who missed
last year dur to an injury. will start at one
forward along with a transfer from Buf-
falo University. Mark Winescoop. A 6'5"
guard. John Long. will provide scoring
punch off the bench.

Strengths- The team has a considerable
amount of depth this season and their re-
bounding. which'was abysmal last year.
has gotten stronger. according to their
coach.

Weaknesses- They are a young team and
nobody has played with each other
before. It might take a while before the
players become comfortable with each
other.

Versus Albany- Like all the other teams.
Albany State stomped Cortland twice by
scores exceeding 20.

Bxpectations- Coach Williams believes
his team will rise out of the cellar.

"I think we're going to be looking at
another team down there." said
Williams. "We‘re going to better next

eat."

It is believed that "better" still won't
boost them out of last In the rugged
SUNYAC East.

Prediction-Last.

Sauers. “They even tried to pro-
voke him In the LeMoyne scrim-
mage. but I think he has learned
that he has to control himself In
those situations."

In the past it has been a dif-
ferent story. Croutier has let his

’ temper get the best of him. In the

SUNYAC tournament. his
freshman year. Croutier resorted
to fisticuffs when he was taunted
by a Buffalo player. Croutier got
himself into all kinds of trouble
that season. In his freshman
year. Croutier received five
technical fouls as compared to
the six that Sauers had received
In the 26 years previous to that.

But there Is a good side to that
also. It seems to pump the team
up when. they are playing
uninspired basketball. according
to his teammates.

"It brings the team together.“
said Hart. "Sometimes he even
plays better when he gets mad."

Said Adam. "He wants us to
win so much that when we are
playing lackadaisically he will do
what he thinks it is necessary to
fire us up."

Croutier is also known for be
ing a very clutch player. When a
game comes down to the wire
Croutier is the man that the
Danes count on. '

"I like to take control at the
end of games." said Croutier.
"That way If I make a mistake I
only get mad at myself."

But those mistakes are few and
far between. Last season
Croutier had hit 64 out of his 68
second half foul shots for an ex-
ceptional 94 ercent. He is the
centerpiece o Albany‘s delay of-
fense in the waning moments of
games. but those days are now
over. The SUNY Conference has
instituted a 45-second shot clock
for conference games. This will
limit Croutier's foul line
appearances.

"I don't even notice the shot
clock." said Croutier. "I probably
won't notice it until the end of
games. That‘s when I'll lose my
10 points. But it will only be on
for conference games and only
have I0 of our 25 games are with
conference teams."

As far as predictions for the
season Croutier is
characteristically optimistic.

“Out of our 25 games." said
Croutier. "I expect us to win 19
or 20. even though our schedule
is one of the toughest in Division
lll.'.'

Besides playing tou h con-
ference foes like Pots am and
Oneonta. Albany will host its an-
nual Christmas Tournament that
will feature nationally-ranked
Division II Springfield. the
University of Buffalo. and Jersey
City State. a winner of over 20
games last season.

Albany should be in every game
they play because he is one of
the'premier guards in Division III
basketball.

“He's the best guard I've ever
played with." said Adam. "He
should score his 1.000th point in
the first few games of the season.
If Danny plays as well as he can.
and not get carried away. he is
the best guard in our league.

"I have to guard him one-on-
one every day in practice and It‘s
always a battle. I w0uld definite-
ly rather have Danny on my

 

 

 

. .,i~.-.~.tu:.«.

Iteam than have to play against
lhim." :1

But with Croutier at the point. -
