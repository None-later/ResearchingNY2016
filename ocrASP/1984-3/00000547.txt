month. The event drew a sparse
crowd and vocal protest, resulting
in heavy financial losses for
Speaker's Fortrm.

Mike Berman. secretary of
Speaker's Forum. said “the big-
gest problem with Anne Burford
was she was never voted on. the
chair, Ricky Feldman, made the
decision and (an) official vote was
never held."

When told of Berman's com-
ments. Feldman said,» “Mike's
mistaken. i know a vote was
taken and it clearly passed."

Fanny Trataros. who was vice-
chair under Feldman and became
chair after his resignation, said,
“Anne Burford was voted on and
it passed within the group."

Although she had been vice-
chair at the time that complaints
began to surface within the
group, Trataros explained, “No
one came to me with the problems
because I‘m a personal friend of
Ricky’s."

A member of Speaker's Forum
who asked not to be identified
said. “A lot of people in the
group went to the SA office with
complaints  they took our corn-
plaints and added it to complaints
they had (and) gave him a choice
of going before lntcrnztl Affairs
(Committee) or resigning. The
group as a whole was not happy
with him."

According to licldnum. “this Is
the first time I‘ve hcztrd of thru.
SA had nothing to do with my
dccision. my main conccrn was
for the group.“

The group member who did not
want to be identified said. “Thch
were really a lot of things he
(Foldman) did wrong. He violalcd
the constitution and appointed
his friends to the committees in-
stead of voting on them. Now we
vote on them.”

Fcldman asserted that at n
Speaker's Forum mccting earlier
this year. he asked members if
thcy wcrc intcrcatcd in chairing
committees.

"About ten people were and I
discussed this all with them 
and l appointed six the head of
thesc committees. Elections were
not held bcczlusc some of the
committees were not in the con-
stitution  they were temporary
committee chairmen pending a
new constitution."

Fcldman pointed out that an
election was held last week and
that “everybody who won  had
been appointed to those positions
with the exception of one who
became vice-chair.”

Stcvc Russo, chair of Central
Council's Interim! Affiars Com-
mittcc. which would have con-
ducted the SA investigation, said.
“before we got a chance to look
into it. Ricky Fcldman resigned
and the problem worked itself
out."

Last spring, when Fcldman was
Speaker’s Forum treasurer. the
group's budget was frozen after
Adam Barsky, SA’s Controller at
the time. charged the group’s
leaders with mismanagement and
ﬂagrant breaches of policy.

Among the charges made at the
time was an accusation by Barsky
that Feldman attempted to receive
$103 from SA for a car accident
in the Thruway House parking lot
that occurred, according to
Feldman, while he was on
Speaker’s Forum business.

Golubow said there has been
recent improvement in. the
management of Speaker’s Forum.
"Since Ricky's been gone,“
Golubow said, “things seem to be

going much better."
