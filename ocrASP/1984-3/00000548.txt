Peace movement speaker

455

Speaking as a guest in ’the‘

SUNYA President’s Lecture
Series, Young said that peace
movements “have a tradition go-
ing back 180 years and have failed
in all kinds of ways." by not
preventing wars or banning par-
ticular weapons.
Casting them
peace movements. Young spoke
of "single issue peace groups"
that have united since I979.
Young said he feels that the

“new breed” .

United States “ is ignorant of the
European people on the side of
the peace‘movements," and that
“new constituencies have been
actiyated" against further build-
ups of nuclear weapons.

The European movement has
“moved beyond anti-U.S..feel-
ings" and has been “less aligned
with pro-Soviet Communism,”
Young said, calling the idea of
non-alignment “very exciting."
He added that the movement, has
been associated exclusively with

Don't Walk Alone

tion, Nizen said. “they want us to
succeed, but they don‘t give us
money to succeed with."
“We're working with six
ﬂashlights and buttons,” Nizen
stated, adding “we didn't get any
of the things they said we would
— it's kind of disturbing," he

said.
Original plans, he said, were
for escorts to receive “Don’t

Walk Alone” jackets and picture
l.D.’s. To cut ecsts, however,
escorts have been provided only
with number buttons they must
Wear while on duty.

Another problem, aceording to
Nizen. has been unreliable
volunteers. “80 percent are
reliable,” he admitted, “but
there's always that 20 percent."

Nizen said that escorts work in
pairs. and there were only two

escorts assigned per quad, so if
even one escort doesn’t show for
a shift, people can't be escorted
from that location.

When asked whether his
volunteering was worth the time
he put in, Nizen said, “I‘d say yes
normally, but the disorganization
makes my say no. We could be
doing a lot more if we had more
funds; more organization.”

John Harmon, an escort from
State Quad, said “It (“Don’t
Walk Alone") is effective for
those who know about it (but) it's
not popular yet," adding, “they
gave us some training. but it’s not
stated how you go about your job
as escorts.”
that the

Harmon suggested

quad escorts set up tables like the

 

 

 

opposition to the Pershing and
Cruise missies since 1979, but that
a European “nuclear free zone"
had been their broader goal.

The new movement. according

to Young, has placed less em-
phasis on parties and political in-

volvement, and more on mass ap- .

peal. “There is a community
base," Young said, adding that
many localized nuclear free zones
now exist in Europe. voted into
place by local citizens.

escorts in the library‘ have and
perhaps wear their buttons all the
time, so they can be identified as
escorts whenever needed.

Stressing that it is important
for escorts to be visible, Harmon
also suggested escorting students
from the gym and setting up relay
station so that escorts don't have
to leave their stations empty for
long periods while escorting
someone.

“I don’t think many students
feel the need for it (“Don’t Walk
Alone"), or realize what it’s
about," said Harmon.

One sophomore, who didn't
want to be named, admitted, “i
don't use the “Don’t Walk
Alone” program. I feel safe walk-
ing and don’t feel I need it.
There's always people around

just screaming, used his amplifier
to begin his countdown. They felt
they were the ones who should
begin the scream, not a non
“Pit” resident. “He thinks he
can dictate when we scream. He‘s
trying to climb the social ladder
and he‘s skipping too many
rungs," Hochhauser criticized.
“We reject his friendship," add—
ed Mark Dunuane.

Other downtown residents have

expressed their opinion of the
screams by throwing water and
other objects onto the “Pitsers”
below. “We aren't going to let
one or two students spoil it,” said
Serrano. Aspen added, “l don’t
think that many people care
anymore.”
Third floor Waterbury residents
generally reflect Aspen's altitude.
“It’s a good ventilation of
frustration and illustrates the
prison-like atmosphere of the
dorms," said Doug Siamon. “We
like to listen instead of scream,”
Kevin Corcoran said.

Some residents, however, seem-
ed less accepting. “Brian Smith
said, “It was funny, but it’s get-
ting out of hand. It‘s a used
joke."

another a celebration, support,
and new academic friendships.
The event was sponsored by the

Graduate Student Employees
Union (GSEU).
It was liberating. Fun.

Graduate Student Employees en-
joyed getting out of their Depart-
mental closets. They talked,
laughed, ate, drank and laughed
some more. incredibly their new
companions were grads from
departments and disciplines other
than their own. Every one en-
joyed new areas of discussion
with new friends. For three hours
the Biology Lounge was a bir-
thing room for some warm com-
fortable collegiality at SUNYA.
Anthropology grads talked to
Biology grads, English with

of Waterbury Hall Carol Stenger
has been supportive of the group
of howlers. “Carol has been
undertanding of the entire situa-
tion. She understands the reason-
ing behind it,” he said.

Stenger said, “I have done ab-
solutely nothing. I'm being very
neutral. It‘s not something l’ve
encouraged by a long shot.” She
said the residential staff of the
quad has only recievcd two for-
mal annoyance complaints. both
concerning “a minute and a half
of noise."

Stenger said she has made no
move to put an end to the scream»
ing so far, and is awaiting direc-

‘ tion from her supervisors.

When asked if he foresees the
possibility of a student screaming
at 9:00 during an actual rape or
attack, and the cries being
mistaken for a primal scream.
Duanuane replied, “Not here, it's
an all male dorm."

“I think you could tell the dif-
ference between an attack and a
primal scream," said Smith. “By
having a primal scream I think
acts of violence will be less com-
mon because everyone will get

their aggressions out via the
primal screams," said Cathy
Brannigan . I III

They also compared notes on stu-

one thought them strange. They

Twelve of the GSEU‘s state ex-

sent. They lent a SUNY wide
perspective. Common themes
amoung the GA,TA,RAs from
Albany. Binghamton, Stony
Brook and Buffalo were small
salaries, inadequate insurance,
workplace problems and
moonlighting. Many said the par-
ty was a harbinger of the state
wide unity that would better their
social and academic environment.

the union, was partying and being

Zacharek laughed but quickly
countered that the GSEU was not
around to promote individualism
but movement unity.

All in all, it was quite a success.
The GSEU even noted that 30
new members joined that Friday
going gathering should be started.
Perhaps a GSEU-TGlF or ‘just
