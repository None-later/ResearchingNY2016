Students who need to stay on
campus during recess will be ac-
comodated in Brubacker and
Sayles Halls on' Alumni Quad.

Anyone planning to stay on the
dov'vntown campus should be
aware that no food services are
available during recess, but kit‘
chen areas are accessible.

One international student from
Puerto Rico said she would be
staying at the downtown campus
this holiday. She said she plans to
cook a traditional Thanksgiving
dinner for some of her friends
who aren't having one. “I‘ve
never cooked a turkey before, but
we'll see how it comes out. They
said they'd eat it even if it burn-
ed," the student said.

The Equinox/Refer organiza-
tion is sponsoring a Community
Thanksgiving Dinner, which is
open to all. The dinner will be
held at the First Presbysterian
Church on Western Avenue
November 22 between 1 pm. and
6 pm. Turkey, ham, sweet
potatoes and butternut squash are
just some of the few delicacies to
be offered to all area residents,
free of charge.

Varada Pandya, from India,
saidvshe plans to make the trek to
this holiday to
celebrate Thanksgiving with her
former roommate's family and
that ‘she had formulated plans to
“eat and pig out."

One dismayed student said she
was not, anticipating the holiday
homecoming with as great en-
thusiasm. “It's unfair," she ex-
claimed, “I’m going home to
beef," not the traditional turkey.

For the most part, the turkey
and the date have now become
solidified as part of American
tradition.

Even during that period of
havoc in 1939, there was never
any doubt about that tradition in
the mind of Mrs. W.M. Venable,
of Atlanta, Georgia.

Venable adjusted to the date
change, but nearly “lost her
hen,” when she locked herself out
of her house while her husband
was at a football game with the
only key. With the turkey certain
to be cremated, she called
reporters at the Atlanta Journal
who sent word to the press-box,
who notiﬁed the announcer, call-
ing for Mr. Venable to return
home, which hedid, in time to
rescue the bird.

highly qualified. “He was a very
talented individual," said
Hamilton. “The department
needed a person and there wasn’t
a large number of candidates
available. They chose him, con-
sidering that a langauge' problem
is improveable."

Economics Chair Pong Lee
said that this was the first year the
department has hired instructors
whose fluency in English was in-
adequate. “There are times when
you can’t help it because there’s
no one else," said Lee. “We try
not to hire people who can't com-
municate well. In this case, I'm
not sure that it might be in.
tolerance on the part of students.
But in the future, I’ll do my best
not to put someone in who can't
speak English."

In some academic departments,
Kendall said, chairs are limited in
their alternatives. Instead of hir-
ing a foreign graduate student,
she explained, the department
could hire less qualified
American-born candidates, or
they can choose not to offer the

 

class at all.

“There are lots of students and
very few faculty, so we need
teachers," said Kendall. "The
question is, who do you put in
there? The foreign students have
a good knowledge but those who
can’t communicate shouldn’t be
teaching. But when the alternative
is to not offer classes, we don’t
have much of a choice.”

In an informal random poll
taken by the ASP, more than half
of the students polled said that
they had been taught by an in-
structor that couldn’t speak
English well. But Hamilton
disregards the poll’s results.

“I’m not going to take the cf
fort to make changes it" 50 percent
of the students say that there’s a

problem," saidHamilton. “As a

society, we tend to be intolerant
of differences. When you ask
students the question, they'll say
yes but that doesn’t mean that
there was a problem: 95 percent
of the students would complain
about the dorm food, but that
doesn’t mean that there’s a
problem."

Hamilton said he believes that
as a University, one of SUNYA’s

goals is to expose students to
other cultures. He said it is
“enriching to have foreigners
among us," and although there
might be a language problem, it
has been exaggerated by students.

But some SUNYA ad-
ministrators’ views appear to be
in conflict with Hamilton’s.
Chesin asserted, “My judgement
is that if enough people tell me
that they had problems with pro-
fessors with strong accents, then
there is a problem. But before we
remedy it, we must determine if it
is a small problem or if it’s
widespread. It could be just a
handful of people with bad
accents.”

In the informal survey taken by
the ASP, four academic depart-
ments, Economics, Computer
Science, Math and Physics, were
mentioned repeatedly as depart-
ments with instructors who don’t
speak English well.

Rob Marinelli, a junior, recall-
ed taking ECO 300 under Pro-
fessor Kwan Koo Yun. “It was
silly for me to even go to class
when you could barely unders-
tand a word he said," said
Marinelli, adding “the only per-
son who spoke worse than him
was his TA."

Senior Seth Myles said he feels

that “basically the problem lies
with TA's teaching lower-level
classes. With upper-level classes,
there hasn’t been that much of a
problem.” As a second-semester
sophomore, Myles said he had no
idea of what was going on in his
Economics class. “I had to go
back and try to memorize the
book," he said, adding “there's
so much material to study in
Economics that's it’s only fair for
the professor to tell you what’s
going on. But you just couldn’t
understand him."
Deirdre Sanders, a junior, saidit
was important to give foreign
students a chance to teach. “Just
bccause they have accents doesn't
mean they should be prevented
from teaching," said Sanders.
“But they should show the
capacity to understand English
and be understood by students,"
she added.

In Physics 105, Sanders recall-
ed, Professor Jagadish Garg had
difficulty understanding ques-
tions from students. “You feel
that the lack of communication is
|directly affecting your understan-
iding of the material," said
Sanders.

Junior Jackie Corbelli said she
was forced to drop her class
because she couldn't understand
her professor. “It was hard
enough learning calculus without
having to try to understand the
professor," said Corbelli. "He

- couldn't say what he wanted to in

class, so it didn't make sense for
me to discuss things one-to-one."

Although Chesin acknowledg-
ed that there is a problem at
SUNY‘A, he said he believes that
there might be a communications
gap between students and pro-
fessors. lie explained that some
professors probably aren’t aware
that they have a problem.

“It's not something that the
University is trying to ignore,"
said Collins. “If students don’t
come forward, we assume that
cvcrything’s OK."
