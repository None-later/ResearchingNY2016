In an official statement. Tass said test
launchings would be conducted near the
equator. with the test site covering a radius
of 65 nautical miles from the coordinate of
15 degrees 12 minutes latitude and 176
degrees 52 minutes longitude.

“Tass is authorized to state that to en-
sure safety, the government of the

Isntuiliu, Egypt
(AP) President Hosni Mubarak and Jor-
dan's King Hussein conferred Monday .
aboard a yacht in the Suez Canal on the

mand a role for the PLO in Middle East
peace talks.

Egyptian officials told reporters the two
Arab leaders met without aides for their
talks Monday tnorning.

Hussein, who was to ﬂy back to Jordan
later Monday, told the EgyptianParlia-
tncnt on Sunday that there can be no Arab-
lsracli peace talks without the Palestine

Liberation Organization as a "full part- 5

ner“ to the negotiations.

The king said he was ready to work with
the PLO in the search for peace but re-
jected suggestions that .Iorday bargain
with the Israelis on the I’LO's beltalf.

criticism that Western Eu rope fails to con-

 

 

$7.8 billion spending increase through
1991 aimed at improving Western
Europe’s ability to absorb a rapid influx of
US combat troops.

The new money would help upgrade

reinforcements in the event of war with the
Soviet Union .

U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger, arriving Sunday for the ses-
sion, said the Soviets had decided to
resume arms control talks with the United
States because the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization had remained strong and
unified.

Budget to be drafted

. Washington. D.C.
(AP) President Reagan turned his atten-
tion again Monday to drafting a 1986
budget plan that leaders of Congress and
his own administration insist must restrain
defense spending to win support for poten-
tially sharp cuts in popular programs.
White House spokesman L‘arry Speakes
said the president was meeting twice Mon-
day with a dozen senior aides to go

through the government’s innumerable
programs and come up with ways to lop
more than $40 billion off the $206 billion
deficit projected in fiscal 1986, which
starts next Oct. 1.

Speakes said that at Monday’s first
meeting, the president and his aides were
continuing to look at domestic spending
programs. If they get that out of the way,
he said. the group may tackle the defense
budget in the afternoon. Final defense
numbers probably won’t be agreed on un-
til next wcek. he said.

Employees strike

Chicago
(AP) The nation‘s third-largest public
school system ground to a halt Monday, its
430.000 students told to stay home until
further notice after the union representing
40,000 teachers and other school
employees called a strike.

Talks broke down early Sunday morn-
ing despite a Board of Education offer that
satisfied one of the union’s tnost pressing
dctnands. on medical insurance. Other ma-
jor issues in the dispute are pay and the
school board‘s cost-cutting plans.

Negotiations were set to resume at l
p.m. Monday, and Board President
George Munoz said. “We are determined
to work for a speedy resolution of this
matter.“ Munor declined to respond to
questions about the strike.

A pilot program set up by the Student
Association of the State University
(SASU) and Kaypro Computer Corpora-
tion could earn thousands of dollars of
computer equipment for SUNY student
organizations.

According to SASU's executive vice -

president Stuart Friedman SASU is not en-
dorsing Kaypro computers. they’re just
sponsoring informative demonstrations of
the equipment at five SUNY campuses in-
cluding Albany, Binghamton. Roekland,
Plattsburgh, and Stony Brook:

Last Thursday and Friday Kaypro held a ‘
demonstration in SUNYA’s lecture center ,

halls. No actual selling took place, but in-
stead students were referred to local
dealers, and offered a 5 percent discount
with their SUNY ID. cards.

The deal between SASU and Kaypro has
not been specified on paper. Friedman
asserted, explaining that its a pilot pro-
gram. “We’re experimenting and they're
experimenting,” he said.

In addition to the five percent student
discount, Kaypro will loan a computer
system to the five pilot campuses for a
several month trial period. If SASU and
Kaypro like the way the pilot program has
worked, they will explore a deal in which
SASU will receive a free cotnputcr system
for roughly every 20 comptttcrs sold to

SASU officials said they were approach-
ed by the advertising agency of Morris.
Rushworth, and partners. which
represents Kaypro. After examining their
proposal. SASU decided to work with
them.

 

Friedman said SASU is very interested
in acquiring a computer system that would
link all the SUNY campuses together.

Executive director of SASU Scott Wex-
lcr explained, “With the tuition increase
issue, for example. we can use our pre-
programmed tnodcrn ctmimunications

, Kaypro, SASU working on computer package.

system to keep various student associa-
tions informed. It will have definite
political benefits."

As to SASU’s motives behind the deal,
Friedman stressed that SASU stands to
gain thousands of dollars of computer
equipment. He also mentioned that SASU
had evaluated Kaypro’s system and found
“it's the best for the money."

There were several important factors
that contributed to SASU's first ofﬁcial
entry into sponsorship of a public corpora-
tion. The first is Kaypro's lack of dealings
with South Africa. a country that’s come
under heavy criticism for its policy of
apartheid."We looked into it, and Kaypro
has a very clean record on this," according
to chler.

Another main reason for working with
Kaypro, SASU officials said, is that the
political process is very time consuming
for SASU, and a computer would make
inter-campus communication tnuch easier.
In addition, financial accounts can be ac-
cessed effortlessly.

One of the possible dangers involved is
that of losing objectivity in the face of a
free ride. However. Wexler dismissed the
fear saying. “There will be no infiltration
by Kaypro into the SASU decision making
process."

“We are looking for the education

Male dancers to appear Thurs. despite protest

By Michelle Busher
I IIIIURIAI. ASS/S I'ANI'

The male dance review Class
Act will be appearing in the (‘am-
pus Center Ballroom Thursday.
but only after residence officials
refused to allow the event to be
held on Indian Quad.

Residential Life Stuff decided
against the show about a tnonllt
ago. because of a plan to have
SUNYA students participate in
the show.

The event is being sponsored by
Colonial and Indian Quad llotuds
and ('Iass of '86.

According to Social (‘lutirmuu
for Indian ()uad lloard. Ross
Abclow. “they (Residence Stuff)
claimed it was an event they
didn‘t feel was appropriate on the

 

Quad."
“I think it's people" choice off
campus." said As. tnnt Vice

President for Residential Life.
John Martonc. adding that lie
didn't think “that kind of sexist
routine" was appropriate for the
atmosphere the University tries to
present.

"1 think it's 1111 absurd deci-
sion." Abclow contcndctl.

“Indian Quad Iloard had
originally planned to open the
show with a "(‘hippcndule's ('on»
test" in which uutle SUNYA
students could perform their own
dance routine. said Jessica ('uscy.
Director of Student Activities.

'1 he prol'cssiotutl act turned out
to be longer than expected. so the
Quad ltoards decided that there

was no need for the warm-up
show. she added.

“It was the warm-up show that
we were Inost opposed to." said
Martonc. He added that there is a
difference between an entertain-
ment group that is somewhat pro-
fessional and a warm-up. rising
SUNYA students. that would
“just be a group of guys getting
up and stripping."

(‘ascy said that the ()ffice of
L'utupth life had uuitcd until it
had all of the necessary informa-
tion on the revue before deciding
whether or not the ct cut could be
held in the ballroom.

"We don‘t think it‘s the best
way to spend tuoncy." said
('ttscy. adding however that thc
rcvtte. “seems to bc donc in good

taste." She also said that she did
ttot foresee :my protest to the
event.

“It's a different situation (com-
pared to female tlanccrsl.” Casey
concluded, “based on the fact
that you are dealing with men
who are not an oppressed
group."

Martone disagreed. saying, “It
would be the same thing as if we
had Playboy Iltmnics." He added
that hc didn't think there was a
difference whether it \\'11\ men or
women.

“It‘s a matter of community
slamlards." he continued “The
campus community should be
respectful of each individtutl." Itc
said. “Our business is not enter-
tainmcnt but education." he add-

ed, "1 don‘t thinkthis event ac-
complishes what we are trying to
do."

Martone also mentioned that
he “would not be opposed to it if
the appropriate student groups
say this is what their constituents
want.”

According to Abelow, Indian
Quad Board as well as Class of
‘86 voted untmimously itt favor of
the event and Colonial Quad
llourtl was strongly in favor of it.

Despite various steps taken by the Corti-
puting Center to increase the security 01'
the SUNYA computer system. the theft of
computer programs is still a problem, ac-
cording to faculty and students in the
Computer Science Department.

Computer Science Professor Dean
Arden. who teaches computer science.
said, “Computer cheating is fairly
prevalent...when we do catch somebody its
mostly by accident."

Security for students' files has been in-
creased ovcr the last year. according to
Benjamin Chi. Associate Director of the
Computing Center, who said. “We've set
up for each student a file of his own, ac-
cessible only by the user-1.0. and
password. Previously. we had common
files on a course basis, that provided some
degree of security bttt were potentially
violatable, and once you got into the file
you had access to cveryonc’s stuff."

Chi explained that “the user-1.1). is a
relatively public thing, to prove that you
are using your user-1.1). you have to supp—
ly your password."

The password, Chi said. can be changed
by the student at any time. and added
"There are people who never change their
password anti tltttl's awful. it's so easy" to
break into a program in that case.

According to Dave Reich, a Teaching

Assistanl(T/\) in the department. there are
several ways in which a student's program
can be stolen.

A program can be taken out of the TA‘s
mailbox. it can be stolen at the dispatch
window. or it can be stolen by gaining ac-
cess to a student’s computer file. be said.

Reich said he considered the last method
to be the worst. and added, “If I caught
somebody going into a file and stealing a
program I would fail them for the
course."

When students want a paper copy of
their programs. they instruct the computer
to make a print-out, and then pick it up at
the dispatch window in the Computing
Center.

When they pick it up. they identify it by
the “banner identifier.” a number and let-
ter combination. 1f the student is not
careful in keeping the identifier a secret.
another student may be able to steal the
printout. Reich said.

Scott Apfel. a teaching assistant for CS1
:01. felt the most common problem with
progranuttlng assignments was sharing,
saying, “Most people, if they have so—
tncone elsc‘s program. the other person
knows about it."

Reich said he felt that touch of the pro-
bletn with stolen programs is a result of
students not being careful enough. and not
being adequately trained “ to use the com-
puter terminal right to protect

themselves.“
Last September. the Cotnputing Center
issued a publication entitled “Standards

and Ethics Governing the Usage of Univer-
sity Central Computing Facilities."

The Standards hold the student respon-
sible for protecting the integrity of their

 

Student worklng at a r ‘ termlnal

 

user-I.l).'s and passwords as well as for
'“any misdeeds associated with that
user-1.0.. regardless of who actually com-
mitted them.”

Another problem is the theft of com-

puter time. At the beginning of the
