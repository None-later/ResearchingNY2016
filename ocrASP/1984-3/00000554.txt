creates positive GSEU attitude

By John Crawford

Worker unions are changing.
Some are in decline. Others are
adapting to technological and
structural changes in their in—
dustries. Others are being born.
The Graduate Student
Employee’s Union (GSEU) is be-
ing born.

It is a union of The
Graduate Gfaduale
A s s i s t a n t s ,
TeachingAdvocate
Assistants and Research
Assistants who work for the State
University of New York. The
GSEU has a growing chapter at
SUNYA.

The GSEU is a union to look
at. It has an inherent structure
that predicts the future look of
unions. And, it is a channel to re-
establish a comfortable climate
for unionism as we proceed to the
year 2000.

The current profile of GA, TA,
RAs probably foretells the gross
characteristics of an employable
population in the years 1990 to
2000. The age range: twenties to
mid thirties. A general equitable
proportion of males to females.
An inequitable proportion of
minorities. A significant number
of married and single parent
households. And there is a promi-
nent population of international
students who intelligently use
their education to obtain degree
and job opportunities around the
world. All in this profile have
degrees, many have more than
one. They are employable.

Between I990 and 2000 this
employable population will be
working in lower and middle
management positions in the
private sector; in teaching, service
and management positions in the
public sector; and as higher paid
service workers in both sectors,
such as nursing.

These are considered very good
areas to establish organizing
drives and create new unions.
They are areas of past exploita-
tion or of current neglect within
paternalistic bureaucracies. The
GSEU is organizing within such a
bureaucracy: SUNY.

The GSEU finds itself on‘ the
cutting edge of American
unionism. It is a training ground
for the future multi-degrcc work
force. Its structure predicts that
work force‘s mobility and
usefulness. And it can indirectly
produce a friendlier climate for
unionism.

First. the GSEU can produce
union members who learn to ad-
vance the group’s interests im-
mediately, then carry that
knowledge wherever they go.

The union‘s unique structure
will supplement the immediate
importance of solidarity. MAs
and PILDS graduate every 2 or 3
and 4 or 5 years respectively.
Consequently, the GSEU can not
create a permanent internal
hierarchy of elites. It has to be a
grassroots union and a par-
ticipatory union. It must organize
its members year after year. The
union must be run by many active

members and not by an old boy’s
network. whether male or female.

GSEU members are ambitious
and mobile . They will get jobs
and then transfer to better jobs.
They will also transfer their feel-
ings of solidarity, organizing

skills and knowedge of par-.

ticipatory democracy. They will
effect whatever organization they
enter: other unions, professional
associations, community groups
or political parties. They may
even form new unions etc.

This mobility and direct par-
ticipation will be characteristic of
future successful unions. Unions
must be prepared to accept
mobile workers and reaffirm
union democracy. The GSEU is.

The GSEU can promote a pro
union environment. Graduate
employees are teaching an
undergraduate population in the
hundreds of thousands. TAs will
not teach ‘Union lOl.’ but their
iolidarity, social values and union
successes will be transmitted to
students. Just as an active conser-
vative movement helped prepare
the way for current American
politics, an active union move-
ment on campus can prepare a
new positive attitude toward
unionism.

In these ways the GSEU is a
model for unionism. Not only to
win just benefits for work per-
formed, but to create a positive
context for the existence of
democratic unionism in the near
future. I‘l

Letter drive begun

Studets waiting in line for supper this week will
have a chance to write to politicians. urging them
to resist the legislation for a twenty one year old
drinking age.

Chair of Student Action Committee Steve
Gawley is heading the letter drive, where students
are provided with a fact sheet and asked to write
their own letter to legislative leaders.

Over two hundred letters were written by
students on Indian Quad on Sunday and a total
of over four hundred letters were written on Col-
onial and Dutch Quads on Monday.

To achieve the goal of two thousand letters,
the Student Action Committee will be on State
Quad Wednesday from 3:30 to 7:30pm and will
be on Alumni Quad next Sunday.

Blood disorder tested

Former staff member of the Student Health
Service Margaret Krikker has founded the
Genetic Foundation for Hemochromatosis, a
disorder where pe0ple absorb too much iron into
their blood.

According to Krikker, Hemochromatosis can
be fatal without treatment, but if treated, the
symptoms, including liver seirosis, diabetes and
heart problems, may be relieved.

Testing for Hemochromatosis is currently be-
ing conducted in Red Cross bloodmobiles in
fourteen counties in the local region, said
Krikker.

By giving blood regularly, people with the
disorder may reduce the amount of iron in their
body, treat the disorder, and help others by giv-
ing blood at the same time.

Machines vandalized

Bus ticket vending machines were installed in
three key places on campus last Tuesday in an at-
tempt to make the tickets more available, said
Assistant Vice President of the Physical Plant,
Dennis Stevens.

The vending machines were placed in the cam-

University Police building, and on the downtown
campus in Houston Cafeteria. Bus tickets are
also availavle in the campus center snack bar and
the book store.

Since the vending machnes were installed last
Tuesday, they have been vandalized twice.

“The machines were put there for the students’
convenience," said Stevens. “I would hope that
the vandalism does not continue."

Podium supplies late

The project to place new roofing materials in
the bottom of planters on the podium is com-
plete, said assistant vice president and director of
the physical plant, Dennis Stevens.

Stevens said the project has been a successful
one, in that the majority of the leaks into the lee-
ture centers have been eliminated.

The contractor is presently waiting for supplies
to get in before he can finish the rest of the work,
which involves replacing podium drains, said
Stevens.

“The contractor expected the supplies three
weeks ago and they aren’t here yet,” said
Stevens, adding. “weather permitting, we hope
to have it completed by the beginning of the spr-
ing semester."

Students visit vets

Students and staff on State Quad from
Melville, Irving, Steinmetz and Tappan, as a part
of a staff group project, will be at the Veteran’s
Hospital of Albany today.

According to State Quad Residence Director
Wes Cable, some of the students will present a
take off on Late Night with David Letterman en-
titled State Night, followed by a sing-along and
social hour for the veterans.

Cable said that he hopes some students will
sign up to make return visits to the Hospital to
work with the veterans and possibly help out with
different kinds of therapy.

Community Service credits are available for
this. but Cable said the veterans are very happy
with the one time visit. The veteran's administra-
