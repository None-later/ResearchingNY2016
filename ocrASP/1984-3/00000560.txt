representitive for Morris. Rushworth,
“we’re helping each other.” '

ASked whether this was a unique oc‘
curence, or whether SASU will continue to
link with various businesses in the future,
Wexier contended, “We want feedback on
this. Should we be doing this? We think
so. but we'll 'wait for the students to
say...We need to'furiher our role as stu-
dent. advocate here. We’re looking towards
a rent-a-car service for discounts. The stu—

SUNYA as one of the five campuses that
will display Kaypro, will recieve a com-
puter system. Albany’s Student Associa-
tion is working with SASU. by helping to
facilitate smooth operations for Kaypro.
Rich(Schaffer. SA president. said that he
was ‘very supportive of .the showcase for

Kayprp because, “it is an opportunity for -

students to get computers, and offers
directs benefits to us."

 

Computer cheating

43

semester each student is assigned an ac-
count of computer time. If a student uses
up her-his time allotment, they must re-
quest more from their TA.

Reich said, “A lot of people have been
stealing accounts to get more time.” Ac-
cording to the Standards this “constitutes
theft of services. a felony according the
laws of the State of New York.”

One practice which is apparently not too
common at SUNYA is that of illegally

gaining access to computer files, which

was featured in the movie War Games

 

when a teenager breaks into a Defense
Department computer.

“There is no history of that" occurring
with the SUNYA computer system, Clii
said.

Both Reich and Apfei said they had
heard rumors of people gaining access to
University files, but could not confirm
them.

Arden also said he had heard rumors.
“The most inventive case i heard of — the
student really didn‘t do anything but tell
the computing center it was possible (to
gain access)” adding, "I haven't heard of
any criminal acts.”
