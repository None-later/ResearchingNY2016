20 ' ALBANY STUDENT mass t:t TUESDA y, DECEMBER 4, 1954

Profs offer expertise in Albany lecture series

By Mike Zeldos
A federal grant, the expertise of

several SUNYA professors. and

the determined efforts of a
university librarian have been
combined to create a year long
series of presentations focusing
on the city of Albany and its
heritage.

The series, "Experiencing
Albany: Past. Present. Future" is
being funded by a $60,900 federal
grant from the National Endow-
ment for the Humanities(NEH).

SUNYA librarian and project
director, Anne Roberts applied
for the grurtt. and, along with the
support of Albany Mayor
Thomas M. Whalen, and other

community ﬁgures. she said the

.“prestigious organization" ac-

cepted her proposal and funded
the project.

. In light of the city’s upcoming
tricentennial, Roberts called the
project. “A lead in helping a city
celebrate its 300th birthday." Ac—
cording to Roberts, the presenta-
tions are being held on Sunday
afternooris at various locations
throughout the city.

The first program took place
November 4 and presentations are
scheduled through September,
I985. In the months ahead.

Albany: Baseball Beginnings.

SUNY professors giving
presentations include history pro4
fessor Kendall Birr. associate art
history professor Roberta Berns-
tein. and english professor Bar-
bara Rotundo.

The main purpose of the pro-
fect, Roberts said. is to provide
an opportunity for the people of
Albany to better understand the
heritage of the dity they live in.
She also said she is conﬁdant this
goal will be attained because at-
tendence at the ﬁrst presentations
has been good and response she
said she has received has been
positive.

Another benefit of the series,
Roberts said, has been the union
of university scholars. community
leaders. and residents working
together in a common cause.

Within the last year Roberts
said she has brought together a

great many people in her quest for
the success of the program. She
called it a “community effort" to
enjoy the cultural past of the city
they inhabit.

An Albany realty ﬁrm donated
brochures and artwork for the
posters and flyers, being done by
John Slocum. an Albany artist.

The support by SUNYA facul-
ty has been quite strong. said
Roberts. Dean Snow. a professor
in the Anthropology Department
who is presently on Sabbatical,
took the time to share his
knowledge of archeology with the
public at the series’ first presenta-
tion. Roberts said.

Sung Bok Kim, the chairman of
the SUNYA History Department
recently lectured about Albany’s
history to over a hundred people
at the Albany Public Library. "I
had a wonderful time,“ he said.

Kim spoke about the Albany
and Van Rennselaer Patroonsltips
in the l7th and 18th centuries. Hc
focused on the beginnings of the

  
 

town of Albany and its economic
and political relationships with
the patrromship. '

History professor Warren
Roberts called the series “a grand
idea.” Roberts gave a presenta-
tion about the Tiffany stained
glass windows of Albany on
November l8.

The windows were made by
Louis Tiffany. who is considered
by many to be the ﬁnest stain
glass artist in the period of
1870-1920, Roberts said. adding
that Tiffany's work can be seen in
several churches and one
synagogue in the City of Albany.
Roberts spoke from the First
Presbyterian Church where the
Sea of Galilee window, one of
Tiffany’s greates achievements, is
displayed.

Roberts said, “the situations
are too seldom that members of
the university can talk to the com-
munity," adding. “It’s a great
way for the faculty to bring its ex-
pertise to the public."

Textbook buybacks being considered

been, but I don't tltittk it could
come through," Campbell added.

As of now SA's plan is in a
developmental stage. but. said
Rich Palton. Cltair of Council's
Student Community Committee.
“If I come up with concrete plans
there is a possibility that space
can be made and a store can go in«
to effect by next semester."

As ' fnow, Campbell said. “we
(the bookstore) arc puttittg a lot
of money back into the pockets of
students.”

“Last December the bookstore
bought back $62,262 worth of us-
ed books — and that is just a
drop in the bucket compared to
May’s $120,745 buyback tur-

nout." she asserted.

“We will pay half price for a
used book and then sell it for
three-quarters of the original
price, but the critical poittt is we
can do this only if the book will
be used next semester," Campbell
said stating the bookstore‘s
buyback policy.

“Otherwise.” she said, "the
buyback rate is anywhere front
nothing to ten percent to close to
fifty percent.” If atom is used
frequently in many schools,
Barnes and Noble may pay up to
50 percent of the original pur-
chase price. she added.

But. Dalton said. “It is evident
by the number of book lists on
the walls that there is a definite

dissatisfaction" with the current
system.

“I think this shows that
students are going out of their
way and I am confident it (an SA
buyback plan) cart cotne
through." ltc said.

Solomon added. “Right now
the main goal is an awareness
campaign that is there are other
alternatives to Barnes and Noble"
for selling used texts. _ .

“There is a used book board
located in the SA lounge that
works in the same fashion as the
ride board.” he said. The SA
lounge is located in the first floor
of the Campus Center.

Albany faced Union College, who had two
freshman guards in their starting line-up.
The Union guards were no match for
Croutier and the ailing Adam as Albany
won the game 70-6l. Croutier scored l6
points and had seven steals and Kauppila
scored 10 on ﬁve for six shooting.

The next night Albany took on York
College from Queens in the ﬁnal round.
York had beaten RPI in overtime after the
Danes did away with Union.

Against York. Albany took a 13-2 lead
and never looked back. The ﬁnal score of
the game was 102-67 in favor of the Danes.
With [:05 left to play in the game,
Cartncllo had two of the most pressured
free throws you’ll ever see in a blowout.
Albany was one point away from totalling
100 points and Carmello was fouled by
Mark Parsons. The freshman calmly sank
his first shot to put the Danes over the cen-
tury mark.

Albany's players that dressed for tltc game
scored at lCtlSl four points. According to
Sauers. that was the first time in his 30
years of coaching that he had l3 players
score itt ottc game. Croutier played a

'pltcnontcnal tloor game dishing out eight

assists itt l6 minutes. Zadoorian also had

‘six assists with Rich Chapman hauling in

eight boards.

Croutier was named MVP of the tourna-
ment and Ursprung and Hart to the all-
tournament team just edging out Kaup-

was comprised of Kevin Bartlett of Union.

The next Wednesday, Albany took on

' ' Ithaca at University Gym. Albany used
tough defense to stop center Andy Vye and.

the Bombers.

For 10 minutes Ithaca stalled, scoring
only two measly foul shots as the Danes
took a 33-20 halftime lead. “Our defense
played a very good game," said Sauers.
-“And our main defensive effort was
deﬁnitely on Vye.” ‘ '

Vye. who came into the game averaging
27 points left University Gym with only l4,
most of which came after the Danes took a
65-48 lead with only 5:50 left in the game.

Croutier and Hart led Albany to" their
86-65 win. Croutier had 26 points on l3-l9
shooting and Hart scored 21 on l0-13
shooting and also grabbed eight
rcboumds. Zadoorian added ﬁve assists.

The Danes' season so far has featured a
team that plays stingy defense which is
characteristic for a Sauers squad and one
which has nine or IO players that can con-
tribute, which is a different story from last
year.

“Defense and depth," said Sauers. “are
no doubt the keys to our success."

Hart realizes that the depth of the team

is a great motivator for him. “Thank God
for Rich (Chapman) out there; he can real-
ly rebound. It makes me play harder,
because if I don’t do the job I know damn
well they‘re going to take my a-- out of
there."
HOOP-LA: Hart is shooting a torrid 72
percent from the ficld...Kauppila (must be
leading the nation in free throw shooting)
has yet to miss a free throw in 13 attemp—
ts...Hart is rebounding at a 7.25 clip per
game...Sauers now has 483 career vic-
tories. just 17 away from 500...Croutier is
averaging 4.75 assists a game...The Danes
have a team field goal shooting average of
52.3 percent and a free throw average of 76
percent.

Leskowitz, from Port Jefferson Station,

tial to add depth on the floor exercise.

Vlasaty, an all-conference gymnast from
Ardsley. competed all-around when in
high school and is strongest on the bars
and vault.

Husak, from East Syracuse, is one of
the team’s strongest tumbles and most
graceful dancers. She looks to be one of
the team's most consistent on the balance
beam and ﬂoor exercise events as well as a
potential all-around gymnast.

Seskin, from New Hyde Park, competed
all-around in high school and also con-
siders the beam and floor exercise event to
be her forte.
