, Reagan to meet Tutu

Washington. L).C.
(AP) President Reagan, anxious to give
Anglican Bishop Desmond M. Tutu “an
accurite understanding" of U.S. policy
" toward South Africa, plans to meet Friday
with the black South African cleric who
has called the policy “immoral, evil and
totally un-Christian,” a White House
spokesman said today.

“The president looks forward to
meeting this distinguished leader” who
won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, said
spokesman Robert Sims.

Tutu has been an outspoken critic of the
administration's policy of “constructive
engagement” in which it has sought to
discourage economic sanctions and other
pressures on the South African govern-
ment while working through diplomatic
channels to encourage change in the white
supremacist policy of apartheid.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plant met standards

.Danbury, Connecticut
(AP) A Union Carbide Corporation
pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, where a
chemical leak killed at least 1,267 people
and injured thousands, was built to the
same speciﬁcations as U.S. plants, a
spokesman says. .

Jackson B. Browning, Union Carbide’s
director of health. safety and environmen-
tal affairs, responded Wednesday to a
charge made by India’s minister of
chemicals and fertilizer. Vasant Sathe.

Sathe charged that Union Carbide,
which owns 51 percent of the Indian sub-
sidiary that operates the plant, failed to
provide the same safety standards it would
for a similar plant in the United States and
kept the Indian government “uninformed
about the safety devices in the factory.”

Indian ofﬁcials have said they expect the
company to provide financial compensa—
tion according to American legal stan-
dards. The company has maintained that it

has enough insurance to cover any
eventuality.

Statewide

.Tax savings possible

New York City
(AP) While the Treasury seeks to eliminate
or limit many income tax deductions to
which Americans have become accustom-
ed, its retention of a new one could cost it
billions.

The new deduction is indexing, which
begins automatically on January 1 as a
device for protecting taxpayers from being
shifted by inflation into higher tax
brackets.

The Tax Foundation has estimated that
indexing could save taxpayers $8 billion to
$10 billion on their 1985 taxes, and poten-
tially more in times of greater inﬂation.

Pay hikes proposed
Albany

(AP) Judicial salary raises along with the
legislative and executive pay hikes are in—
cluded in a proposed bill being negotiated
between Cuomo and legislative leaders.

The salary raises proposed to take effect
January 1, 1985. would increase the base
pay from $32,960 to $43,000. Alaska
legislators earn about $48,000 a year, but
they receive no per diem expenses. Total
pay comparisons frotn state to state are
difficult to make because added benefits
vary.

 

  

 

Correction

In the December 4 issue of the Albany
Student Press. Political Science Pro-
fessor Anne Sloan was quoted out of
context in an article on a Professor's
Forum on the Arms Race.

Sloan was outlining what she said were
the three different views held on the arms
race. The are people, she said, who see
the arms race as only a continued com-
petition, and those who believed it can be
controlled through negotiations, and also
those who think that only a technical
breakthrough, such as ‘Star Wars'
weaponry, can stop the continued build-
up of nuclear weapons.

The quote used in the article seemed to
say that Sloan favored the ‘Star Wars'
weapons, when in fact she had, later on
in the forum, ridiculed that particular
proposal as both dangerous and
unfeasible.

The ASP regrets the error.

The controversy over selling por-
nographic magazines, such as Penthouse.
Playboy, and Playgirl, in the Barnes and
Noble bookstore on campus has forced the
store to put the publications out of sight.

"The bookstore does not wish to act as
campus censor," said Marj Campbell,
manager of Barnes and Noble. “but we
have placed the magazines behind the
counter to cut down on the embarrassment
of passing customers."

“This issue puts the bookstore in a

‘ precarious situation," she said. “We have

tried to compromise, the magazines are
still available, you just have to ask for
them now.”

University Auxiliary Services leases the
bookstore concession to Barnes and No-
blc, and UAS Bookstore Committee chair
Karlccn Karlson said, "the bookstore
policy is a workable and practical solution
to the problem."

“What astonished me," Campbell said,
"was that no one has come to me about it,
usually a delegation from the women‘s
groups are in here" if the issue comes up.

Campbell said she is aware of the con-
troversy through reading letters on the
editorial page of the Albany Student Press.

On November 2 John Spcttel wrote to
the ASP advocating the existence of por-
nographic magazines in the bookstore. He
said, “Penthouse, through the art of

photography, enhances the beauty of
women," adding that removing the
magazines would violate First Amendment
Rights.

Another student, who requested their
name be withheld, wrote in opposition on

October 30, calling pornography "anti-
women propoganda." The letter accused
Barnes and Noble of being an agent of
pornography, and "contributing to
violence against women in the SUNY
community."

According to Stacey Young. Student
Association media director, "SA has not
taken an ofﬁcial stand yet although my
hopes are that they will in the future."

Young said. “I have talked to (SA Presi-
dent) Rich Schaffer and given him infor-
mation, I hope SA will take an ofﬁcial
stand because I think it is a relevant issue
for all students."

“At the same time." she added, “we
have to remember that the real target is the
pornography industry and not necessarily
the individual places that sell it.”

Karlson agreed, saying she was concern-
:d about a conﬂict with the First Amend-
ment of the U.S. Constitution, which
guarantees freedom ofspeech. “I fear cen-
sorship.” she said, “where does it stop?
Can it go as far as our library shelves?"

Citing an awareness campaign as a
possible solution to the problem, Karlson
said “the best way to deal with the pro-
blem is by working with the media and
educating men on what pornography really
is."

Campbell asserted, “my personal opi-
nion is that i don't care if we sell the
magazines. I would rather we didn’t, but I
am afraid of a backlash if I stopped selling
them."

Young added, “I think the bookstore
has taken a step in the right direction, I
think it is important for us to work hard to
get pornography off the shelves
everywhere.” [:1

New MoneyMatic fee could invite competition

By Tom Bergen
STAFF WRITER

Student and University officials
are exploring possibilities of get-
ting an additional banking service
on campus in light of Marine
Midlands recent implementation
of a 20-cent fee for balance in-
quiries on their MoneyMatic

Machines.
The fee. which applies to
Marine Midland’s Mid-State

Region, including the northern
and central parts of the state, the

capital district and the southern
tier of New York. went into effect
on December lst and is designed
to eliminate “unnecessary tran-
sactions which increase the traffic
on computer lines,” said Howard
Broadnaex, Assistant Operations
Officer at Marine Midland.
Marine Midland has operated
two 24-hour moneymatic
machines in the lobby of
SUNYA's Campus Center since
1978, said E. Norbert Zahm.

According to James Lamanna,
Assistant Vice President for

at MoneyMatic machines in the

“Racism in America is the same as racism in
South Africa...except that racism in South
Africa is legal,” said Bojana Jordan. Chair of
the American-South African Friendship Associa~
tion, in a speech Monday night in the Campus
Center Assembly Hall.

South Africa, charged Jordan. is the “only
country in the world where it’s illegal to be born
black.” Jordan spoke in front of 30 people as
part of a panel discussion on South Africa and
Anterican investments in that country.

Citing the South African constitution, Jordan
explained that it is illegal to pay blacks the same
amount as whites for equal work. “In the 1940‘s
and 1950’s the average salary (per week) for
Blacks was five dollars. Now it's twenty dollars,"
said Jordan, a South African native who has
since moved to the United States.

The whole system in the African nation is
geared to “eliminate Blacks,” Jordan said.

The South African government has borrowed
money from American banks in order to “buy
tnore guns to kill Black protesters.” Jordan said,
adding that without money from foreign coun-
tries. the government would not be able to
persecute Blacks. South Africa is second only to
the United States and the Soviet Union in total
armaments, he said.

Besides the United States, Jordan said
Canada, Get any, Israel, Japan, Great Britain.
and France have millions of dollars invested in
South Africa. '

The African country also has vast mineral
deposits of gold, diamonds. and copper that are
wanted by industrial countries, said Jordan.

The SUNY system has about $17 million
dollars invested in South Africa, said Jordan,
who urged SUNYA students to put pressure on

Panel urges South African divestiture

'American investments in South Africa help

the school's administration to divest their money
from South Africa. SUNY is “aiding and abet-
ting aparthcid." he asserted.

The American people must understand who is
ruling in South Africa, said panelist Henry
Elonge, President of SUNYA’s African Students
Association.

"There are many Nazis in South Africa who
left Germany after the war.” he charged, adding
that many members of the government supported
Hitler during the war, even though the country
officially fought as part of the British Empire
against the Nazis.

Elonge, who said he agrees with Jordan that
Americans should stop investing in South Africa.
explained that divestment will have more
psychological effects than economic effects. “It
will be a shock to the international economic
system. Maybe others will follow." he said.

SUNYA students “should go after New York
State” instead of pressuring just the SUNY
system, said panelist Jerry Lee. an aide for
Assemblyman Arthur Eve. deputy speaker for
the State Asembly.

The state has about $2 billion of taxpayers‘
money invested in South Africa. Lee said. “We
should get them to reinvest in companies doing
business in New York State,” he added.

“All decisions for New York are made right
downtown." Lee said, urging students to lobby
the state government. . -

In the past students have worked for divesture
from South Africa. according to Troy Oechsner,
one of the organizers of a year long campaign for
SUNY divestiture which failed in 1979.
Oechsner, one of the panelists, said the Board of
Trustees refused to divest its holdings because of
"the Sullivan Principle" which says that

   

 

blacks by keeping the—country's economy aﬂoat.

 

 

we‘re not really taking something
away from our customers that is
essential.”

A large percentage of SUNYA
students are Marine Midland
customers, spurring student
leaders to express concern over
the new fee.

In a letter dated November 6th
and addressed to Anthony Shay,
Branch Administrator of Marine
Midland, Student Association
President Rich Schaffer called the
fee “both unnecessary and in-
convenient." Schai'fer said, at
that time, “if the charge is ap-
proved. there are discussions to
find another banking service at
the Albany campus.”

Marine Midland pays the
University Auxiliary Services
$600 per year for each machine in
a contract which runs out on July
31. 1987, according to Zahm.

Dan Altman, a student member
of the UAS Board, said, “We’re
going to be looking into some op-
tions. We're not looking to get rid
of Marine Midland, we're looking

for more options."

When asked about getting
more banks on campus, Zahm
said “One of the problems we
have is space. Where are we going
to put other machines?”

Zahm said that one clause in
UAS’ contract with Marine
Midland says that “‘Our students
will be afforded the same beneﬁts
that are afforded students at
other campuses.‘ so if they
change the policy at other cam-
puses we'll still be at the top end
of it.”

Since the balance inquiry fee
does not apply to schools outside
of Marine Midland’s Mid-State
Region, both UAS and SA are
looking into whether this clause
could be used to remove the fee
from SUNYA.

Shay, of Marine Midland,
would not comment on that
possibility, other than to say,
“We would have to have our peo-
ple in Buffalo (location of Marine
Midland’s Main Office) look at
that. [:1

“We’re not really taking
something away from our
customers. ”
