Rabbi says world tensions force
Soviets to slow Jewish migration

By Leslie Chait
STAFF WRITER

Having travelled to the Soviet
Union with the theme “I seek my
brethren," Rabbi Simon l.
Konovitch related his experiences
to SUNYA students and grappled
with the question: should Soviet
Jews have to go to Israel or
should they be permitted to go
wherever they want when they
leave the USSR?

“There are pros and cons."
said Konovitch. speaking on cam-
pus Tuesday. “Some people say,
‘well. the Russian government
gave them permission to leave on
the grounds that they want to be
reunited with their families in
Israel, and should therefore go to
Israel’.” Others, he said, “feel
that any individual who can free
himself or herself from anywhere
in the Iron Curtain should do so.
To save a life you don’t ask any
questions."

for the work to be done." He added, “the work will

University officials are taking a lot of heat for a
new sprinkler system slated to be installed on Alum«
ni Quad just prior to and during finals week.

Konovitch also asked, “when it
comes to working on behalf of the
freedom for Jews in Russia, what
should be the approach? Should
there be mass protests and mar-
ches, or should there be quiet
diplomacy?"

“Protests and demonstrations
do have an effect,” asserted
Konovitch, adding, “we should
demonstrate whenever there is an
opportunity. "

In talking about Russian
Jewry, there are two questions to
be considered, Konovitch con-
tended, these being, “should we
concentrate on a mass exodus of
Jews from Russia or should we
safeguard the rights of Jewish
people living in Russia to make
sure they are given the privilege of
living as Jews in Russia?”

Jews came to Russia approx-
imately |,000 years ago, and settl-
ed in the Crimea, Konovitch said.
“Despite the persecutions, Jewish

.time had come to create the

life ﬂourished in Russia for
many. many years," he
continued.

“The birth of zionism began in
Eastern Europe, " stated
Konovitch. Russian Zionists were
university students who’ believed
that there was no future for Jews
in Russia. and so decided that the

Jewish State of Israel. The
founders of the modern State of
Israel. according to Konovitch,
were Menachem Begin, David
Ben Gorion, Golda Meir, and
Chaim Weitzman, all of whom,
he said, emigrated frotn Eastern
Europe.

Currently, he noted, “Jewish

religion as well as any religion is
outlawed in Russia.” But, he
asserted, “Despite the persecu-
tions, the spark of Judaism still
ﬂickers in Russia." He cott-
tinucd, “the quest. for religious
observance is deeper than people
realize."

When international relations
are not going well, Konovitch
said, the Soviet Union clamps
down on emigration, and when
they become less frigid, the
government permits Jews to leave
Russia. However, when relations
are going poorly, Jews are once
more restricted from emigrating,
according to Konovitch.

Today, according to statistics
Konovitch cited, there are about
2.5 million Jews left in Russia.

“We hope and pray that the
struggle, and the Cold War, and
everything else that‘s going on
between the superpowers will
cease for the sake ofcivilization,"
Konovitch said. adding “we look
forward to the time when the
superpowers will negotiate peace
and a halt to the arms race.
“There is no question that this
will affect immigration and the
conditions of Jews in Russia," he
concluded.

Konovitch said his trip to
Russia was “a great experience."
and continued by saying, “It’s
very important to visit Russia. We
hope and pray that the confronta-
tion between East and West will
(be resolved) and the people who
want to leave Russia will be able
to...and to be reunited with their
families.” TL]

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

According to signs posted on Alumni Quad, cott-
struction of the system, planned for Alden and
Waterbury Halls, was scheduled to begin December
3. and be completed by January II. The posters
said work would start between 9 and 9:30 am. and
would “be noisy."

Alumni Quad residents have expressed strong
concerns that the possible noise could impede their
Studying during finals week.

Asserth Alumni Quad representative to Central
Council Mike Miller, “It‘s totally unacceptable for
the University to impede the learning process with
these petty antics, the University could always in-
stall the sprinkler system at a more appropriate
time."

Hoping to get the construction postponed, Alum-
ni Quad Board member Greg Cadillo, in coopera-

tion with Alden and Waterbury Councils. got more'

than 600 students to sign petitions which were sent
to University officials.

The posters anticipating the noise, said Vice
President of Student Affairs Frank Poguc, were in-
accurate and were put up by Alumni Quad Director
Phyllis Canty. without his knowledge. “The new

inconvenience.”
The work on the sprinkler system has been sub-
contracted, said Dennis Stevens, maintaining that it

“will be handled in a quiet fashion."

An official of D.A. Bonnet Incorporated, the
contractor that was commissioned to install the
sprinkler system asserted that the noise and in-
convenience would be minimal.
