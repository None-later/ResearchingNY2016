Although she is obviously against drunk
driving, Weiss doesn’t support the 21
drinking age proposal. "I don't think the

The activity involved setting up a display
area next to that of the Marines. As the
Marines were showing training ﬁlms, the
activist group was showing the actual hor-
rors of the Vietnam War in the acclaimed
documentary “Hearts and Minds.” Other
videotapes shown in opposition to the
Marines' presentation were “Atomic
Cafe,” “.leo Hill," “Missing,’' and
assorted antiwar rock ’n’ roll videos.

Kwanza celebrated

Maulana Karenga, the Executive
Director of the Institute of Pan-African
Studies in Los Angeles, will speak this
weekend as part of a Kwanza week
celebration sponsored by the Albany State
University Black Alliance (ASUBA).
Kwanza, a Black cultural holiday of-
ficially celebrated from December 26 to
January I, was establishedin 1966 by

vice. There are currently 350 members of
the academy.

Recruitment opposed

In what was described as a “video war,"
a group of campus activists staged an event
in opposition to a three-day recruiting ef-
fort by the US Marines at the State Univer-
sity of New York at Stony Brook
November 26-28. The group's aim was to
provide people walking through the Stu-
dent Union with a visual contrast to the

The activity was organized through the
Red Balloon Collective, a direct-action
oriented Marxist group on campus. The
group learned that the Marines were plan-
ning the recruitment effort only the week
before it was scheduled to occur, so dif-
ferent members of the group donated the
equipment needed for the event, including

Karenga. A non-religious holiday, Kwanza
was not designed to take the place of
Christmas, but, instead “to strengthen the
bonds between us,” according to Karenga.

Karenga's- appearance, Saturday
December 8, in the Campus Center
Ballroom, is sponsored by ASUBA and
Speaker's Forum.

Store Issues pollcy

To prevent customer sloppiness, Barnes
and Noble bookstore now has a'sign in the
newspaper section that reads “Please Do-
Not Read These Newspapers Unless
You’re Going To Buy Them." I

According to store manager Mari
Campbell. “the people who have to keep
that section neat and tidy are utterly
frustrated." She explained that several
customers often read the papers and then
return them unorganized; this lessons the
appeal of the paper for the next customer.

Wharton is one of the lowest paid
cxccutivcs of a university system
in the United States.

Ramnlcy said that for at least
the two years that she has been at
the school, SUNYA’S luck of
salary competitiveness has been
discussed. “I’m delighted that so-
meone has rccognizcd that
something needs to be done," she
said.

If the salaries of SUNY of-
ficials were more attractive, “that
would make it easier for me to
hire good deans when I do have to
do that." said Ramaley.

“Right now the people in the
New York University System are
dedicated to their jobs, but at
some point, with their kids wan-
ting to go to college and the salary
balancing at the other end, SUNY

whether or not they can afford to

dorm rooms designed for single
or double occupancy.

At the University of Nebraska,
for instance, where there are
5,160 spaces available for more

placng three students to a room.
“We won't turn any student away
because of housing shortages,"
said Housing Director Doug
Zatcchka.

Zatechka claimed tripling up
students “has no effcct on a stu-
dent's GPA or the socialization
process." especially compared to
the alternative of turning students
out in the cold.

“Turning a student away,
especially at state schools. is a
crime,” he said. “For a student, a
triple room is better titan no
room."

None of it, however, was sup-
posed to happen. I I

Many campus houing officials
counseled that the terrible dorm
over-crowding of the late sevcn-
ties and early eighties was tem-

porary, and that building new

dorms to meet student demand
for rooms was unwise because
enrollment nationwide was due to
drop precipitously soon.
