ith the chant of the bells, the
Wmusical group Shadowfax began

their performance this past Mon-
day night at the Troy Savings Bank Music
Hall. Their Work reflects a close har-
monization among the members of the
band,which results in a group sound. They
cannot be classified along any one type of
music since their work is inﬂuenced, an in-
tern reflectgs a wide base of musical
ranges.

Shadowfax opened their performance
with the title song of their second album,
Shadowdance. Starting out softly, the
backbeat of the piece was soon added to
with layers of musical rhythms that in-
terweaved themselves into and out of the
main beat. With the fine acoustics of the
Music Hall, their music vibrated out to the
audience, raising their adrenaline and filled
the air. The momentum, built up and kept
radiating enegy with the intensity of dawn
about to break.

When the applause subsided, Crcy
Stouson, the band's tZ-string acoustic and
ﬁshing electric guitarist introduced the
group which began in a farmhouse in the
winter of 1972 comprised of Chuck
Creenberg on soprano saxophone and
lyricon, Phil Magginni on bass and Stuart
Neirtt on drums. in addition to the basic
quartet are lamii Smadzinski on violin and
baritone violin and Jared Stewart on piano
and synthesizers.

The groups sound fuses acoustical elec-
tronics and is punctuated by African and
oriental rhythms that refer at once to an-
cient rituals and the hi-tech society in
which we live. While having more of a
rock influence on their most_ recent album.

called "commercial." it provides a
background wherein thoughts can grow
freely without being interrupted, their
style of world music, resulting from the'
different styles. is what they most identify
with. Yet it doesn‘t create boundaries so
that their scores have a wide range and
their music reaches into a variety of
backgrounds.

A quiet transition set the pace for their
second piece where the undulating
rhythms were modulated by a calmer
violin piece. The Indian mantralike moocl
set the pace and seperated it from the far
off distant backbeat until it gained forces
and the two fused into something reminis-
cent of a full force rock instrumental in-
terlude, creating a tension, then dropping
back until it climbed to the edge, almost
reaching it.

 

Much of their music brings with it the
imagery of visual motion and speed. The

 

rock variation become the center of the
piece until they too fade back leaving the
lyrical poetry of the electric violin to carry
on until the drums and percussion mesh
and the sound unfolds into something that
isn't what it seemed to be in the first place.

The pieces from their new album are still
recognized as being distinctly created by
Sliadowfax, but within the record, pieces
seem to lose their uniqueness and fuse
together. However, included within this
piece was not only the modernist rendition
of rock variations, but at points Smadzin-
ski’s violin took on the classical draw and
tease creating a feeling of giving all, yet
holding out for more.

The control of sound at once reflects the
chases that abound as the music of another
piece started off with the distant cry of the
forest,‘ using such instruments as the
Balianese gamelan gongs, metal and bam-
boo ankglongs, Chinese water cymbals,

a kanjgeera. All of these foreign bells and

bongos lend the music a strange primordial
connection that refers to a collective past
as we sit and wonder where it will lead. us.
Reminiscent of the call of an ancient
nomadic African tribesman, each member
furiously tracks the rhythm of the piece
and then adds the electronic beat, juxtapos-
e two modes of music to create an in-
tensity that is pushing, moving, and
wondering until the drum bumps the
rhythm and at once, all motion halts.

Needing a rest from all this movement
and concentration of energy, Shadowfax
played the more classical pastoral piece,
Watercress Way. It was a slow melodic
almost haunting piece, as the violin
enveloped itslf aroung the lyricon (which
sounds like an electronic flute) and remind-
ed one of a vague reference to a dream
half-forgotten.

In another piece, similar to a musical ren-
dition of an lndian mantra, the group mov
ed into a very lndian Rega style that
waited in and out of reality. The rock
undertones brought one back to the
awarenes of the different things going on
'within, in a slower drawn out melody fill-
ed with Middle Eastern accents played
against the instrumental lndian boat. The
synthesizer pulled everything to bring you
back to musical reality of the present.

Often, the jazz of the saxophone mixed
with the different tonal dependence of the
African beat, creating two trains of in-
ference that coiled \delicatelyubut
forcefully-about one another, off playing
the two distinct melodies. Shadowfax plays

upon the idiosyncrasies of each of the ac-
cents of their music. As one gets used to
the Oriental flavor, the synthesizer and
drums are added which bring a contem-

ing th

 

porary nature to the ancients rhythms.
The final piece, Brown Rice, started out

P: What keeps Star Trek so popular
er 20 years?
I : There are a host of reasons, not the
st of which has to do with the quality of
' material, initially when we did it as a
ies. We had real science fiction writers
opposed to people who simply ex-
olate from other stories, other genres.
I put it in the science fiction nouveau.
se stories are indiginous, or were in—
inous, to science fiction. Most of it,
st of the good stories anyway, we had
clunkers, but the Norman Spinrod
ics, the Harlan Ellison stories, the
 ert Bloch stories; these were specific to
' ‘ medium.
haracters were written dimensionally
played dimensionally. The relation-
5 were dimensional. The characters
e not cardboard heros. They had feel-
and vulnerability. There is the whole
ng of projecting a future that is not
k, does not implicitly suggest a
ogenous society where everybody is
of anonymous. That is sometimes the
ng about the future.
e still had our ethnicity. We still had
cultural differences. And we were
at the same time, to work together
out losing those individual
cteristics. I think these things are
ble and attractive to fans. In addition,
the show went into syndication we
seen so constantly. Not simply

day in some areas. I think we became a part
of the American extended family. We
were in their kitchens and their living
rooms. 1 think they came to view the Star
Trek cast as part of the family.

ASP: What about the converntions? You
see no Bonanza conventions?

WK: l think the conventions have helped
us. i think it’s been symbiotic. Their in-
terest has been very encouraging to the
studio. The word "trekkie" is now part of
our vocabulary. And I think it is directly at-
tributable to the people who come to the
conventions. It is the ones who are am-
bulatory that actually act upon their in-
terests as opposed to sittig passively at
home and watch. At the same time I think
Star Trek is a reason for people to convene.
The people have a like mind, like interest.
They come to conventions as a social hap-
pening. They find that there are people
there they can communicate with. It
becomes an event.

ASP: O.K., but the point is you do not see
any other shows (with the exception of
DR. Who) with the type of following wor-
thy of a convention.

WK: I think there is always a danger in
making sweeping generalities. But l think
science fiction fans, in general. live in their
minds as much as they live any where else.
Any show that stimulates the imagination
is probably one they find attractive. We
did it in a very literate way, and in a very
literate sense. The shows were very well
written. I think they gravitated towards
Star Trek because it was a show that spark-
ed their imaginations. Most people become
indoctrinated in a nine to five world. They
abandon their imaginations, abandon their
dreams.

I think science fiction has the ability to
keep that alive, that child like quality of
wonder and dreaming and so on. Star Trek
became an excuse. it could have been

brought me in. I'd also worked with Gene
Roddenberry in a starring role in an
episode of Lieutenant series that he had
done. And I worked for the alternating
director on a Hitchcock (Hour). So they
knew my work.

ASP: What would you like to see done
with the Chekov character?
WK: I think there is a potential to play
Chekov for humor. lt really hasn't been
done since the series stage. i would love to
see that. Just to be involved in a way other
than just promoting the plot, other than
just reading out the consoles and making
statements about what our velocity is.

another show, but Star Trek did it better.
That is why the conventions continue,
because Star Trek did it better; certainly
better than Bait/csiar Galactica, better than
Space 1999. They tried to do conventions
around those shows, but they were not
able to maintain interest.

ASP: Each mnembcr of the cast has a story
about how and why he was chosen for his
part. What is yours?

WK: l came in the second year of the
show. I wasn't there originally. They were
looking for a character they thought would
have appeal to the bubblegum set, the little
kids. The prototype was Davey Jones of
the Monkees. They wanted that appeal.
Originally the character was going to be
English. They decided, however, that since
the Russians had put the Cosmonauts in
space and they were the first space
travellers, that there should be some
acknowledgement of their contributions.

l was chosen. It was a relatively simple
choice. I had done the part of a Russian in
another television series, A4r. Novak. The
casting director on that show was also the

WK: Probably to some degree. MW
ing a career as an actor is a very difficult
proposition. 80 percent of the actors in the
guild, and the guild’s membership is
500,00, earn less than $3000 a year. On
that basis you can see it is difficult for any
actor to survive econaomically. It is as
much a result of the supply and demand as
it is stereotyping that my career has not
taken of in a more concrete way.

ASP: Would you prefer to be a superstar
who couldn't enjoy a pleasant lunch
without being interrupted and badgercd?
WK: The best of all possible worlds--and
l'm taling fantasy hero-would be to choose
what roles l want to play and to be reward-
ed for it. But that is obviously not in the
cards.

ASP: Do you still engoy doing Star Trek?
Could you picture yourself performing in
Star Trek lV'l

WK: Well my feelings on that continually
change. My present feeling is that it's o.k. I
don’t feel threatened by it. We come to
some kind of grips with the fact that this is
a source of income, not to confuse it with
my ego. The fact is it's a way of achieving
some financial security.

ASP: Did it make sense to spend an hour
and a half searching for Spock or would
twenty minutes have been enough to
reestablish him so that the story could
advance?

WK: No. l think the supposed demise of
Spock was the most extraordinary
phenomenon in the Star Trek literature. It
had to be dealt with with all the attention
and detail it was. The recovery had to be
dealt with with all that attention. I do not
think it was: a twenty minute job. That part
was fine.

Whether or not we should have
destroyed the Enterprise? l had a feeling

prise, perhaps even more than Spock, is
synonymous with Star Trek. But if you can
regenerate flesh, blood, and bone, you can
regenerate stone.
ASP: Did Nimoy not want to do Star Trek
IR
WK: Nimoy said he would come back for
Star Trek II with the provision that the
character was killed off. During the course
of the filming, when he saw how well it
was going; he had been very unhappy with
Star Trek I, as most people were, he stress-
ed the feeling that he would not mind com-
ing back again. Having already written the
script, and been committed to have him
die, they then found themselves backed in-
to a corner. There was some ad-libbing go-
ing on as to how they could ultimately
write another story in which he returned. l
know it was an after the fact concept to in-
clude the shot of the torpedo casing on the
planet. That was not in the script. That was
something decided after Leonard decided
he wanted to return. As far as I know that
was the only thing that was designed for a
sequel.

Leonard's coming up with "remember"
may have been some way that he hoped it
would be able to be used. What I've read in
several articles is that he was looking for
something mysterious to say that would
sound Spockian. After the fact Bennett
decided to use that as a means, as a tie in, a
segue into Star Trek III.

ASP: How was Nimoy as a director?
WK: He was fine. A good man to work
with. Respectful, considerate. and sensitive
to the actors. You have to be careful with
actors turned director because there is a
tendency, I think, for them to try to im-
pose their perception and interpretations as
actors on you. He didn't do that.

ASP: Do you think they will let him direct
Star Trek IV?

WK: l think so. l think that is what's going
to happen.

ASP: If you had it all to do again would

you follow the same route?
WK: You know, I would. I don’t know if
l’d still be in the business if it weren’t for
Star Trek. Seeing what has happened to the
careers of other people an how they suc‘
cumle to the statistics. l may well have
moved on to some other field, one totally
removed from the film industry. Star Trek
has make it possible for me to do other
things. I've acted in theater, I've written for
television, and We directed plays. This life
might have been considerably different if l
hadn't been involved in Star Trek.

Star Trek has not been totally fulfilling
because l didn't train as an actor to play
one character for ten minutes at a time in a
motion picture. On the other hand, there
are actors who have trained and never get
to do anything. So l feel, adding up all the
plusscs and minuses, it has certainly been
advantageous. A mixed blessing, but in the ‘.
final summation it has been more positive 3
than negative.
