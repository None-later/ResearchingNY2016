continued from on
with muffled vocals and hissing sounds.
The tonal variations reminding us of the
beat of a metronome, and the saxophone
slowly began to weave a tapestry around
the stationed beat. The delicate sound of a
morroca-iike instrument gave off a soft
reminder of the steady beat. As the basic
rhythm repeats it picks up a greater intensi-
ty of sound and melody. Each instrument
picked up momentum and force until the
full sound was underway. The violin add-
ed the final polish to the piece in an explo-
sion of musical intensity, charging up the
audience, raising expectations and hopes
and moving everyone with the ever in-
creasing feeling of continual motion and
release until they feait as if they iriusl get
to the top until the continual power of
energy and thythm brought one catharthic
release of tension.
Although it was a short show, the group
played to an enthusiastic audience who ap-
plauded until the hands came back for an
encore of Something quite out of their
style-some good old swing jaz. Big band
sound, big bang ending.

LETTERS

3 bsurd actions

To the Editor:

- Did you hear the latest news? The ofﬁcials at the Stu-
dent Association have decided not to push for the resigna-
tion of Dean Hamilton. Isn't that generous of them?

Student Association has the immense potential to

secure and advance student rights and interests within the
University community. Instead of effectively utilizing this
potential it appears to be abusing it. SA seems stymied in
their efforts by uninformed. over-anxious, self-serving
leaders. Where has their sense of responsibility, fairness
and maturity gone? The recent action aimed at Dean
Hamilton is an unfortunate example of poor SA
judgement.
For the last two years. I have worked rather frequently
and closely with Dean Hamilton on the University
Senate’s Undergraduate Academic Council. In those two
years he has sincerely demonstrated caring and
understanding of both student and university issues. He
has consistently emphasized fairness and soundness in
dealing with all matters. SA’s absurd actions against
Dean Hamilton are not only unwarranted but blatantly
insulting. Considering all the problems and needs of
students today they (the students) should feel priviledged
to have this administrator working for them.

It was only a matter of time before the students on this
campus realized the costs of their apathy in student
government. It is you, the students of this community.
that made SA what it is. SA does do a lot of good for the
studeny body — it can do even more- with effective
participation.

This entire “resignation” issue has certainly been a

1 great embarrassment for many students and faculty alike.

On behalf of them and myself I apologize to Dean
Hamilton.

an individual or group of individuals through cheating. It
is certain we must deal with this academic cancer before it
destroys the institutional principles the majority of us
strive to perserve.

Case in point. In the Dec. 4th edition of the ASP. 1 was
shocked to learn that Delta Sigma Pi, the business frater-
nity, maintains a ﬁling cabinet of old examinations. I am
aware that many professors allow students to take their
examinations, but an equal number, if not more, forbid
students from leaving an exam with the questions. Has
Delta Sigma Pi violated the respect which this university
has for the fundamental building blocks of education? Is
the SUNY system doing all it can to discourage such bla-
tant offenses, especially here at Albany? What can be
done?

I don’t propose to turn administration ofﬁcials into
police ofﬁcers. The responsibility, I believe. of upholding
the ethical standards of this institution belong to the stu-
dent. Yet we cannot turn away from overt academic
dishonesty. I suggest an inquiry by a joint task force of
students and administrators into the accusations made in
that Dec. 4th letter. Included on this task force could be
representatives from Student Affairs. Student Associa-
lion, the ASP, and Delta Sigma Pi. if we are to conclude
that Delta Sigma Pi has violated university policy, let the
proper action be taken. If we are to conclude that Delta
Sigma Pi has operated in an upstanding, ethical manner,
let us dismiss any charges of misconduct with the
reassurance that we have made an effort to understand a
problem which has become rampant. My only concern is
that we, as a university community, are capable of
responsibly addressing one of the most visible injustices
here at Albany.

——Bill King

Blazing example

To the Editor:

Much attention has been given recently to the problems
of students living off-campus. To this plethora of fact we
would like to add a short description of an incident that
occurred in our house yesterday. December 3. Apparent-
ly, one of the girls upstairs left a bare light burning atop
a pile of old wool sweaters in a bedroom closet for a
period of many hours. During the afternoon, the closet
went ablaze. Luckily. as our apartment began to smell of
smoke, a truck from the Albany Fire Department raced to
the scene and extinguished the inferno without serious
loss of property. A fortunaie ending, but something re-
mains 10 be said. One’s home should be a safe, secure
place. In this case, not only were our lives and possessions
threatened but the resources of the City of Albany were
needlessly expended due to carelessness, ignorance and
ineptitude of this young woman.

Double standard

To the Editor:

I was quite upset after reading “Male Dancers to Ap-
pear Thursday Despite Protest," the article about the
scheduled appearance of the male dance revue “Class
Act" which ran in the Dec. 4th issue of the ASP. I ﬁnd
myself upset with the misleading title put forth by the
ASP, but even more so with a double-standard being
allowed on campus.

First off, what protest took place? The outrage against
the prospects of John Valby appearing on campus best
exempliﬁes a protest. For two weeks all I heard about was
how John Valby's performance was degrading to women,
and that he shouldn’t be allowed to perform at this
school. By my standards, the sentiments expressed
against the male dance revue does not qualify as a protest.

Needless to say the strippers are signed and will per-
form. The fact that they will perform does not bother me.
But rather the idea that an act that is “degrading to men”
will be allowed to perform on campus while a performer
“degrading to women,” i.e., John Valby, is barred. Since
men and women are equal, why should such blatant sex-
ual discrimination as this be allowed to occur? Are we to
believe that magazines such as Playboy and Penthouse
and performers such as John Vaiby are degrading to
women, but a performance such as “Class Act.” an ob-
vious exploitation of the male body, is not degrading to
men? I should hope not.

in closing i would like to say I believe lliai men and
women are equal. And with this in mind there should not
cxisi double standards such as the case with ihc male
revue show being allowed on campus.

—Micliucl Clocci

Victory ignored

To the Editor:

i would like to take this opportunity io say that i am
extremely disappointed that the ASP has not yet reported
the victory of [he SUNYA ACM Computer Club in the
Northeast Regional ACM Computer Programming Con-
test. It has been over a month now since the team of Alan

 

Buckivalter. Scott ,‘Ginaburg; Scott Anderson, and
Richard Silverman defeated MIT and 15 other schools in
a test of brute force programming capabilities. Though
we have received recognition from the Computer Science
Department and the Campus New Bureau, I feel that it
was pure negligence that the ASP did not mention the
victory in our school paper for other students to share in
the glory.

The failure of reporting such academic achievements,
surely does not help promote school spirit on this
campus.

Band-Aid solutions _

To the Editor:

I am astounded. over and over again, by Anti-Choice
"feminists." Daily, women are discriminated against
economically, educationally, politically, etc. Discrimina-
tion against women takes many forms; a speciﬁc one be-
ing that there are so few “life” choices available to us.
The very fact that our lives are conﬁned by limited choice
points to a large problem. Taking away a woman’s right
to choose in re: abortion, seems to me to be the ultimate
in band aid solutions. The idea is similar to this: Let's
take away the guns from the Nicaraguan people so that
they can be murdered by the United Statesl There are
good reasons to have an abortion in a world that doés not
value women enough to provide ways for us to sustain
ourselves, no less our children. The problem is not abor-
tion. I think that Long’s analysis points only to a symp-
iom. lfwomcn did not feel pressured inio'pnulu nfen; if
there was contraception available to poor women; ifthere
was cheap daycare; if there was equal pay; if there was no
rape — if all of these problems and more were taken care
of —- then maybe there would be fewer abortions. But
even this is not the issue. I defend a woman’s right to
choose wholeheartedly primarily because very few people
(as was indicated by this election) support even the
nominal Equal Rights Amendment. Do we have time to
piddlc around with the ethics of abortion, when the year
2,000 and the feminization of poverty, (a time when 90
percent of the poor will be women of color and their
children) quickly approaches? I think not. in a world
where women are objectified daily, no matter where we
are or what we do, why take away one of the only
“rights” (however tentative) women have? If sex was not
so narrowly defined as intercourse; if clitoris was a word
we could all pronou ncc, maybe, just maybe, things would
be a little different. Try oral sex. Think about lesbianism.
Think about choice. To utilize Long’s language, “What is
disturbing about this attitude is that it shows such little vi-
sion when it comes to the lives of..." women. This article
blames the victim. Oh yes, let's put an end to abortion,
and then the economy will change. Truly. Gee, maybe if
we disallow abortion. there will be no more warsi! But in
reality, if we disallow abortion. the economy will not
change. wars will not stop, women will starve and freeze
to death along with their children. During the Vietnam
war, the "old days” before abortion was legal, more
women were killed by backroom quacks than were
American men in the battleﬁeld. The idea that “even ii-
lcgal abortion will be safe” is so ludicrous, especially
now, in a time where many women cannot afford the
“safe” prolaglandin hormone and a “scape out." Over
the years, the many trained doctors who have performed

illegal abortions have charged women an arm and a leg
and a nape, for which the victim had no legal recourse.
Try having a baby and going to school. Many men don’t
feel responsible anyway, so you cannot expect “financial
aid" from them. Who is going to pay for the day care?
When you go to school, you must usually spend money —
you do not make it. if Long wants to see abortion become
unobiainablc, I want to hear from her some good solu-
tions to the multitude of problems that women face on a
day to day basis. When a Band-aid falls off, the wound
does not heal.

Get your act together

To the Editor:

Telethon ‘85 24-hour talent marathon will be held on
March 22-3. ii is liizti time of the year to send out the call
to everyone on this campus to put together their act for
Telethon '85. Telethon accepts any type of act. including
song, dance, magical, skits, or anything you can think of.
Auditions for acts will begin in late February. Be on the
lookout for announcements.

In addition. every year, Telethon accepts submissions
for their song. This year's theme is “Today's Youth: The
Promise ofTommorow." The theme song should'inciiidc
any or all parts of the theme put to music. We will accept
these during Februrary.

So everyone start thinking about your talents, and get
your act together.
