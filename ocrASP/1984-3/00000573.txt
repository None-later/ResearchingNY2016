nature of the violence is less
severe. Usually the violence is
kept among the ethnic groups.
Also, since Arab women usually
do not come to us. we are not sure
ofincidents ochwish men attack-
ing Arab women.” said Fer-
nandez, adding that months of
the I982 Lebanese invasion. there
were many incidents of Arab men
gang-raping Jewish women. “It
was really scary because it was
like war within our borders," she
said.

“The fight

said. “They will drink in parks
and drive to drink," which is one
of the major problems the
21-year-old drinking age is sup-
posed to solve. “We're looking at
a dry campus. We're only dealing
with a small percentage of people
who will be able to drink."
Doellef‘cld was not convinced
that SUNYA would become a dry
campus. “That's entirely too
premature to say,” stated
Docilcfeld. “There's still going to
be students who are 21." he said,
adding that factors such as Senior
Week. the Patroon Room and
Graduate Students could not be
over looked when considering a
campus alcohol policy.
Docllef‘cld said that the group's
primary purpose will be to

 

old drinking age" interms of stu-

“assess the .impact of a 21-year- .

lsraeii feminist outlines works

nography in Israel has not been
well-received,” Fernandez said.
“There is quite a bit of por-
nography in Israel, and also very
sexist advertising. One commer-
cial that has been protested is
grapefruit commercial on tv. In
it, eight women in tight yellow
shirts and shorts are singing and
throwing grapefruits to men. The
point of the commercial is to
compare grapefruits with
women's breasts. In slang
grapefruits means breasts now.
Feminist groups tried to stop this
advertisement to no avail." III

SUN YA readies for 21

dent life and what changes would
have to be made in University
policy.

“We need to discuss, as a
group of people, the kind of non-
alcoholic programming options
possible," he said. “Pogue has
invited 7 or 8 people to serve on
the committee." and about half
the members would be students.
Doellefcld said.

Doellefeld would call for more
policy changes than the 18 to
19-year-old change. “Very few
resident students are over 21. a
comparatively small number, and
this will have an affect on alcohol
consumption in suites. Most of
the students will be under age. If
you are now underage and want
to drink. you can do it," he said
because the current alcohol policy

does not regulate in-suite-alcohol

consumption. . .I ~
