words. rather than making an ef-
fort to find out what is the real
essence and structure of the EOP
program. they are content with
tncorporating these false accusa-
tions into their mental
framework.

Contrary to certain beliefs. the
EOP program extends itself to in-
dividuals front all ethnic
backgrounds. The program does
not restrict itself to solely Blacks
and Hispanics while closing its
doors to other ethnic groups. The
EOP program is designed for
students whose cultural and
socio-economic lifestyle serves as
a disadvantage when trying to
compete for acceptance through
regular admission to the
untverstty.

Unlike the mythologies in cir-
culation, those admitted under
the EOP program display a high
academic capacity and promise.

Distorted images of EOP students Widely held '

cant accepted. has reflected a high
potential for mental growth and
achievement.

Some EOP students have felt
the impact of distorted concepts.
They feel as though they are label-
ed “mentally incompetent” or in—
ferior. Others have feltlthe need
to prove themselves mentally ade-
quate to those who have
discovered their participation in
the program.

The EOP Program is extremely
beneficial, and has provided
numerous opportunities for in-
dividuals to attend an accredited
college when their social. cultural
and financial background has
obstructed the opportunity for a
higher education. The program
can be associated alortg the
minority boundaries domestically
because it serves only a small
percentage of students on this
campus. In comparison to the
social. cultural and economic
backgrounds of the majority of
students attending this university,
EOP students can be viewed as a
minority.

Programs of this type are cur-
rently available at other univcr-
sitics although their titles may

courses designed for development
in basic areas of study. financial
assistance. tutors, and academic
counseling. Counselors can also
be utilized to discuss personal and
social areas when requested.
These services are provided to en-
sure as much as possible that EOP
students recieve a thorough
education and simultaneously,
maximize their potentials.

On a social note. it is sad to see
the heavy flow of false labeling
and misinterpretation of EOP
students. Those of you who do
not fully understand the
significance and essence of the
EOP Program and the students
enrolled in this program. should
make an attempt to become aware
of certain truths. and not resort to
spreading negative falsifications.
Had it not been for their ability to
reﬂect academic promise, motiva-
tion. and intelligence. the EOP
students enrolled at this universi-
ty. would not have been accepted.

The truth is that EOP students
are attaining the sante degrees.
declaring tltc same majors, and
performing as well as the students
enrolled at tltc universities by
regular admissions.

STUDENTS:

Do not be troubled by the
negative steroetypes and painted
pictures that cling to the title of
EOP and thus, label you. You
know of your inner strengths and
capacities although they may be
doubted. Had you not shown the
will to utilize resevoirs of infor-
mation and your ability to sustain
that information. it is highly pro-
bable that you would not be here.
As with most things that are a
minority (in terms of scarcity).
mythologies are often created. If
we are not careful. these fabrica-
tions can unconsciously sneak in-
to our image and view of
ourselves.

I truly hope that the next time
someone thinks of the EOP Pro-
gram or the students which it pro-
vides for. positive truths will
result other than literal falseness.
On a general note. before we
become active in circulating
misconstrued information. we
should research the facts. Or even
better. remember the advice “If
you have nothing nice to say, then
please don‘t say anything at all."
After all. sticks and stones may
brcak my bones, but critical
words and negative stereotypes
can kill. C]
