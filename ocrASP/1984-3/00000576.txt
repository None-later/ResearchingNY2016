Women swimmers top RPI

By Sue Riche

The Albany State women’s swimming
team is off to an impressive start as they
defeated RPI Wednesday, 60-49, to up
their dual-meet record to 3-1.

With the resignation of last year’s
coach, Joe Shore, the Dane swimmers are
now headed by veteran Dave Turnage,
who has coached at Glassboro State and
Ramapo College for 11 years.

The women are coming off their finest
season in the history of the swimming pro-
gram. Coach Turnage is not sure whether
this year’s edition will be able to duplicate
the heroics of 1983-1984.

“There may not be a repeat of last
year’s l4-i winning season," said Tur-
nage, “but the team is a very dedicated
group of young athletes."

Wednesday’s victory over RPI included

Hockey club

The Albany State hockey club will try
to rebound from their first loss of the
season when they host Le Moyne Col-
lege tomorrow night at Center City Ice
Rink in Schenectady.

The Dane skaters suffered their first
defeat of the season last Saturday after
five consecutive triumphs. The visiting
Danes were beaten by Mohawk Valley
Community College, 5-2. Albany had
posted a 4-3 victory over MVCC in the
Great Dane Invitational earlier in the
season. _

“Their crowd was really good," said
dcfensemen Larry Hartman. who leads
the backliners with five points. “We just
came out ﬂat."

 

Carol Pearl taking first in the 1,000-yard
freestyle with a time of 11:49 and in the
50-yard freestyle with 27.1.

Nancy Smith’s 6:06.4 in the SOD-yard
freestyle and 2:13.9 performance in the
ZOO-yard freestyle was also good enough
for first place.

Mary Anne Schmidt nailed first place in
the ZOO-yard individual medley clocking at
time of 2134.7.

During the holiday recess, both the
men’s and women’s teams will be traveling
to Puerto Rico.

According to Coach Turnage, the Danes
are trying to coordinate a meet with the
University of Puerto Rico, but plans are
still uncertain.

“The team is doing well for this early in
the season," said Turnage. “I do,
however, think there will be an improve-
ment by the end of the season." El

 

MVCC took advantage of Albany’s
“flat” play to score three quick goals in
the opening ten minutes of the game.
The Danes never recovered.

Tomorrow night, Albany will be
looking for some offensive spark from
their leading scorer, freshman Mike
Mondiello. He has recorded seven
points (4 goals and 3 assists).

The Danes’ third line has also played
good solid hockey: Scott Janicula, Mark
Tisdale, and John Franz.

While the defensive play has been
spotty at times, goaltender Jim Leskody
has come up with a number of crucial
saves. He has been averaging 2-3 goals
agaisnt him.

Men swimmers"

The Albany State men’s swimming
team topped RPI, Wednesday, 61-51, to
even their dual meet record at 1-1.

The Dane swimmers lost their open-
ing meet to New Paltz by 20 points, but
the RPI victory has given the team a new
outlook.

“RPl's a big rival of ours," said cap-
tain Frank Cawley. “It was a good meet
to win because it has motivated us and
given us a better attitude."

The Danes were led Wednesday by a
solid effort from sophomore Greg
Greenbaum, who captured the lOO-yard
freestyle and 50-yard freestyle.

Jeff Kennedy placed first in the In-
dividual Medley with an outstanding
time of 2:10.5.

The Danes next meet will be at
University pool against Plattsburgh.

Last year when the Albany State Great
Danes would take the court for a basket-
ball game, it would be expected that Dave
Adam and Dan Croutier. the starting
guards, would outplay their opponents.
When the opposition would use box-and-
one or triangle-and-two defense to stop the
Danes’ backiiners, the postmen would
have trouble picking up the slack.

So far this year the Danes’ inside players
have been making their presence felt. This
is a major reason that Albany can current-
ly boast an undefeated record. .

“The big men are the difference,” said
Adam. “They're the reason we’re 5-0."

Wednesday night’s 74-59 win over Cor-
tland proved just that. In the first half
Albany’s guards scored almost half of the
team's points; Adam and Croutier poured
in 18 of the Danes’ 38 first half points.
Croutier also dished out eight assists.

Then came the second half and the Red
Dragons put an end to the Croutier and
Adam show by using the triangle-and-two
defense. This meant curtains for the
Danes, right? Wrong.

Greg Hart, Rich Chapman, Pete Gosule
and John Mracek would never dream of
letting the perfect season go down the
drain. In the second half, those four
scored 24 of Albany’s 36 points in the ses-
sion, while Croutier and Adam scored only
five.

But this year the guards have more con-
fidence in the inside players and are not as
tentative about passing the ball inside.

“They are all good offensive players,”
said Adam. “They worked on their moves
a lot over the summer.

“(Assistant Coach) Barry Cavanaugh
deserves a lot of credit. He works with
them at the end of each practice."

Cavanaugh believes that there is more to
the success of the posttncn than his
coaching.

“They all believe in themselves much
more," said Cavanaugh. “They are much
more confident and that is making them
more aggressive.”

Hart is leading the team in field goal
percentage, shooting at a rate of 71. and
rebounding, at seven per game. But on
Wednesday night, the most impressive of
the foursome was Chapman. He is a
sophomore who is playing his first season

The Albany State JV basketball team
came into Wednesday's game against Cor-
tland looking to correct what Coach Jim
Boland labeled “fundamental
weaknesses" in the team’s play. The
results of Wednesday night's game to
Boland were mixed. The Danes won the
game 87-82, but let a 20-point lead dwindle
to a precious seven in the last few minutes
of the game.

The Danes came out ﬂying at the start,
looking like world beaters as they opened
up to a 13—6 lead within the first ﬁve
minutes of play. They were led by Tony
Dickens who scored 8 ofthe team's first 12
points.

Boland remarked, “Our defense played
excellently for the first 15 minutes — we
didn’t have too many fundamental
breakdowns. However, this intensity did
not last for the entire half. When we built
that lead we should have slowed it down
and waited for the open shot but we
didn’t," explained Boland.

in the first half,Tony Dickens set a tor-
rid pacc finishing with 17 points at the half
on 8 for 8 shooting from the field. Addi-
tionally, Charles “Freeze” Storey played
under control and finished with 20 points
on the night.

At the start of the second half.the Danes
began to pull away from the Red Dragons
extending their lead from 39-33 at the half
to 51-40 with 15 minutes left in the game.

“Greg is getting better," said Sauers
after the Cortland game. “But today
Chapman gave us the lift."

Cavanaugh feels that the team's trip to
France over the summer really helped
Chapman get adjusted to the team in time
to start contributing at the outset of the

 Albany’s big men making their presenoefelt ' «

year.

“There was a period of adjustment for
him and the team, and they worked that
out in France," noted Cavanaugh. “He
was accepted from the start. He had no
transition period in the pro-season.

“Rich has very good instincts for the
game — a good nose for the ball."

Chapman realizes that he has just begun
to pay his dues on the veteran team that
features ﬁve seniors. He believes that the
older players have helped him a lot,
especially Hart.

“Greg gets me psyched, he goes for the
ball like no one else he’s my kind of
player," said Chapman. “But I had to
work for it. And I’m still working hard.”

“Rich helps a lot," said starting center
Pete Gosule. “He's doing a super job; it
takes the slack off the other thee. We don’t
lose anything with Rich in there.”

No matter which of the four is playing
the whole team feels confident that the job
will get done. When describing the team
the players use words like, “parity,” and
“unified team," this is especially. true
when discussing the big men. In the Cor-
tland game, Albany’s four big men ac-
counted for 19 rebounds, which was as
many as the whole Dragon team
accumulated. '

“The postmen are helping each other
and subbing for each other," said the 6’5"
Hart. “It makes us a better team.”

“Doc (Sauers) has confidence in all four
postmen."

Each of them has their own specialty.
For example, Gosule is the defensive stop-
per of the group. In a recent Albany vic-
tory over the Ithaca Bombers, Gosule was
called on to guard their high-scoring
center; Andy Vye. Gosule proved that he
was ready for the confrontation as he held
Vye to 14 points, eight of which came in
garbage time, almost half of the 27 point
average that he brought into University-
Gym.

Mracek brings outside shooting into the
position.

“John is a really good shooter, said
Adam. “It takes a lot of pressure off of
the guards to have another offensive threat
in there.”

Hart, who is the strongest of the four, is
the most intimidating on the court and he
never lacks intcnsity.

JV Danes defeat Red Dragons to mixed results

 

“We forced a few shots and made a few
turnovers. For our part we are lacking the
kiIIcr instinct —- the ability to put the game

away.”

—J V Coach Jim Boland

 

The Danes regrouped at half and stretched
that lead even further to 20 points 71-51
with 8:12 remaining in the game.

It was at this juncture in the game when
Cortland started to make its run,sparked
by reserves James Boor and Chris Dodge.
They chipped away at the Dane lead slowly
but surely. The Danes were ahead 77-60
with 4:44 left but at the three-minute mark
they were only ahead by seven.

Boland offered his own explanation, “1
subde a little too early and they didn't
hold the lead for us,said the coach.“We
forced a few shots and made a few tur-
novers. For our part we are lacking the
killer instinct — the ability to put the game
away."

After starters John Carmella and Storey
came back into the game the Danes. were
able to regain some momentum and they
cruised the rest of the way.

For Dickens, it was his best game this
year as he ﬁnished with 29 points. He had
help from Brett Avelrod and Jeff Kee who
both had 13 points. Axelrod was a force on
the boards grabbing 10 rebounds. Dickens
explained hia big night this way. “i play
the swingman and tonight i was looking
for and hitting my shots. Plus it helps to
have Kce and Axelrod in the middle to lose
the rebounding burden. Storey explained
the game this way: “I wanted to pass offto
the bigger guys and hit the shot when
possible."

Couch Boland feels that the team is fac-
ing a lull in ther schedule now, but it will
be tougher after the break.

“We face Junior College of Albany who
we lost to twice last year so we'd like to
beat them this time,”said Boland. "This
team has a lot of heart and if we work
harder we could be much a better team."
