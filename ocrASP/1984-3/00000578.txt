Meat sales banned

Bhopal, lndia'
(AP) Authorities concerned with the
fallout of the iindustrial gas leak that kill-l!
ed almost 2,000 people have banned meat
sales but declared Bhopal's air and water
safe. "

Meanwhile, Calcutta’s Amrita Bazar
Patrika newspaper quoted indian scientists
as saying the methyl isocyanate gas that
escaped from the Union Carbide pesticide
plant Dec. 2 ruined $5.2 million in
agricultbrai crops and could keep the land
barren for years.

Doctors continued Sunday to report new I
cases of poisoning - people experiencing
delayed effects from the pesticide plant’s
leak - and said viral pneumonia was en-
dangering those with lungs damaged by the
gas.

Ceremony marred

Oslo, Norway
(AP) in a ceremony interupted by a bomb
threat, Bishop Desmond M. Tutu accepted
the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize Monday. say-
ing it brought new hope to his fellow South
African blacks and to the oppressed
everywhere.

Tutu. an Anglican Church leader, wore
his purple cassock and clerical collar as he
took the world's most prestigious
humanitarian award for his advocacy of
non-violent struggle against apartheid,
South Africa’s system of enforced racial
segregation.

The presentation was held up for an
hour and 20 minutes after an anonymous
telephone caller told an Oslo newspaper
that a bomb had been placed in Oslo
University's Aula Reception Hall and
would explode in 10 minutes.

Police cleared hundreds of people, in-
cluding King Olav V, from the auditorium
and searched, but no device was found.

“For the world’s leading democracy, the

Label change sought

Washington, DC.
(AP) Some people in the hard liquor

to make their product more palatable to
the baby-boom generation, but first they
have to persuade the government to
change labeling laws.

Their idea is “light liquor," bottled
spirits with lower alcohol content, fewer
calories and more appeal to younger peo-

ple. who are tending to avoid hard liquor.

The problem is that the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms requires
any liquor that is less than 40 percent
alcohol, or 80 proof, to be labeled
"diluted" —- a designation that turns off
buyers.

So the Heublein Spirits Group, a sub-
sidiary of R..l. Reynolds industries, asked
the bureau to allow it to market “light” or

"mild" whiskeys below the 80 proof
minimum without the “diluted” label.

Statewide

Conspiracy charged

Albany
(AP) A former state assemblman and three
other men have been indicted by a grand
jury on accusations that they tried to steal
at least $250,000 from the state by in-
flating the cost of an AIDS research pro-
ject, authorities said Monday.

Those charged in the indictment are:
former Assemblyman Stephen Greco, 65,
of Buffalo; John Natarelii, 27, of
Rensselaer; Pasquale Natarelli, 74. of Buf-
falo, identified as the uncle of John
Natarelli; and John Szczesniak. 33, of
Troy.

The four surrendered to authorities and
were to be arraigned later today in Albany
County Court, said Ronald Goldstock,
director of the state Organized Crime Task
Force.

Testimonies conflict

New York (‘in
(AP) CBS producer George Crile resumed
his testimony Monday in retired Gen.
William C. Westmoreland's $120 million
libel suit, giving jurors an account that dif-
fered sharply from last week’s testimony
by former Defense Secretary Robert
McNamara.

Crile produced the 1982 documentary.
“The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam
Deception,” which accused Westmorciand
of trying in 1967 to prevent information
about enemy strength from reaching Presi»
dent Lyndon B. Johnson and others in
Washington.

Westmoreland, who commanded US.
forces in Vietnam from 1964 to 1968.
deliberately understated the size of the
enemy in order to make it appear that US.
forces were winning the war, the broadcast
charged.

Director James Doellefcld was quoted out

Doellefcld was quoted as commenting
on current alcohol policy when in fact he
was illustrating a point regarding changes
the campus will face if the state drinking
age is raised to 21.

Committee rejects alternate drop/add policies

lan Clements
sun- warren

Student representatives suf-
fered a serious setback Tuesday in
their push for a repeal of a new
add/drop policy known as the
‘W’, approved last spring.

After reveiwing the new policy,
a University Senate committee
recommended that no changes be
make in the policy which is
scheduled to go into effect in the
Fall of 1985.

The Committee on Academic
Standing reached its decision by a
7-0-1 vote last Tuesday after con-
sidering numerous proposals and
ideas concerning the policy.

The new policy which was pass-
ed by the Senate last spring moves
the add deadline from the sixth
day of classes to the tenth. The
drop deadline will remain near the
midtermpoint but students who
drop after the tenth day will have
a “W” on their transcripts under
the new policy.

The committee's recommenda-
tions were submitted to the
Senate’s Undergraduate
Academic Council. The counil’s
chair, Cathy LaSusa had asked
the committee to study the policy.

One of the proposals to change
the policy was submitted by Stu-
dent Association’s Committee on
Academic Affairs (A-Comm).
Assertcd Mike Miller, A-Comm‘s
chair. “SA is committed to
fighting the ‘W’ as long as it
takes." The committee's deci-
sion, he said, “is not such a
superanajor setback.”

SA will try to bring the issue
onto the Senate floor next
semester, he said. "We never ex-

ected the Committee on

cil to look at (the ‘W'). At least
We've got people talking about
problems with the plan," Miller
said.

A-Comm’s proposal called for
an add deadline on the tenth day,
and a drop deadline at the fifth
week, with no “W’s” to be put
on a transcript when a student
drops.

SA .President Rich Schaffer
said SA may attempt to bring an
alternative to the new policy to
the Senate floor through the
Senate‘s Executive Committee.
Both Schaffer and SA Vice Presi-
dent Suzy Auletta are members of
that committee.

Schaffer said he will discuss the
policy with University President
Vincent O’Leary when O’Lcary
returns from a leave of absence in
Yugoslavia in January.

According to Schaffer,
O’Leary “thought we should
work for a compromise so
students wouldn’t feel that (the
new policy) was railroaded down

their throats." O'Leary, said
Schaffer, was aware "that
students weren't happy" with the
new policy.

Committee on Academic Stan-
ding chair Jonathan Barlow said
the drop/add deadline on the
tenth day gives students enough
time to know whether a course is
right for them.

After ten days “you ought to
be able to get a handle on an in-
structor's ability to lecture, what
the course is going to be struc-
tured like” and what type of
student-teacher interaction there
will be he said.

“i really don’t think it‘s impor-
tant whether (the 'W‘) is perceiv-
ed as a penalty. 1 don‘t think
that's the issue involved." he
said. Students will see it as a
penalty regardless of the commit-
tee’s recommendations, he
explained.

Bartow said he did not see the
“W’s” that he received when he
was a student as harmful to his
academic record. “To have 4.5,

sees 20 or 25 “W's” on a stu-
dent's transcript will ask whether
such a student is a “quitter,” he
said.

Steven Rubin, a student
member of the committee, was
the sole abstention during the
vote on whether to recommend
changes in tne new policy.

Rubin said he initially sup-
ported a proposal to allow each
student to drop one course each

student‘s transcript, according to
this proposal which was submit-
ted by two student members of
the Senate, irwin Weinstein and
Andrew Wigler.

Rubin said he found this alter-
native to be infeasible because the
computer system could not han-
dle a program with one “penalty-
frce drop" and because of “other
shortages in other areas.“

SUN YA computer deal gets
Apple, IBM product savings

By Bette Dzamba
.s l .u r \l’lil I‘ER

Apple and 113M computers will be of‘
fered to SUNYA students at savings of up
to sixty percent off the retail price under
agreements reached by thc University and
the two computer companies.

“You couldn‘t get this kind of deal even
if you had an uncle in the computer
business," said Stephen Ragowski,
SUNYA Microcomputer Acquisition Pro-
gram director.

Ragowski explained that exact discounts
will depend on the computer purchased.

As an example of the savings offered,

Ragowski cited Apple‘s Macintosh com- ‘

prrtcr with certain software. two disc
drives, monitor. and mouse is available for
$1,225 plus tax and handling. “The retail
price of the same package is $2.i‘)5." he
noted. adding “that's a $900 (in) savings."

The handling'charge is expected to be'

around $125, said Ragowski.

Francis Lees, assistant vice-president for
Tclccornmunications and information
Systems explained that the handling fee
covers a variety of “extras” that the
University must provide, including
demonstration sites, staff to assemble and
test the computers, at least 20 hours worth
of instruction to buyers, and a service
contract.

According to Ragowski, all faculty.
staff and students are eligible to purchase
the lBM computers, but, he added, “Ap-
pie requires that students carry 12 credits
and that faculty and staff are halftime or
better."

“Faculty can use grant money or private
funds for the purchase, but state money
cannot be used. Ragowski noted.

“Anything in the lBM personal com-
puter line is available," said Ragowski.
"The discount is available for the Apple

Macintosh and Lisa computers, he said,
noting “We are willing to negotiate with
other companies such as Hewlett-Packard
and Leading Edge." He also said. "We'd
like to hear from students what their par-
ticular favorites are."

Computers must be paid for when the
order is placed, Ragowski said, adding
that the contract delivery time is 6—12
weeks. “The product will be tested to be
sure no damage occttrred dttring shipping,
and then delivered directly to the student."
Ragowski stated.

“Macintosh.” according to Ragowski,
“is Apple’s newest entry into the market.“
He said that ~ it boasts “spectacular
graphics due to its high resolution"
monitor. He also said that it has “very
easy-to-use software."

lBM. according to Ragowski, is “the
standard." He noted that “everything (on
the comptrtcr market) isnlBM
compatible.“ ’ -

' R'ago'wski also noted that schools such .

as Drexel and Stevens require that-every

student have a micro. “We have access to '

the software they've developed, including
things such as computer dating," he
added.

According to Lees, the acquisition pro-
gram is a project of the newly organized
Telecornrnunicatons and information
Systems Office at SUNYA. which in-
tegrates the work of the Computing
Center, the Educational Communications
Center. Office of Automation, the
telephone system, and Library Computing
systems. Lees said that another project of
the new area will be the purchase of a new
main frame computer to replace the
University's current SPERRY UNlVAC.
model. [1
