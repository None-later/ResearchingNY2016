“The United States must be a tireless sen-

an address to a Yeshive University con-
vocation in New York City. “We must
confront aggression."

“For the world's leading democracy. the
task is not only immediate self-
preservation but our responsibility as a
protector of international peace, on whom
many other nations rely for their securi-

Jacksons’ tour ends

Los Angeles
(AP) The Jackson Brothers, illuminated
by an autumn moon and laser beams,
rocked into the hearts of thousands of fans
as they concluded a 55-concert, five-month
Victory Tour occasionally troubled by
criticism and confusion.

The show was sold out with about
50,000 people, although 2,000 tickets had
been available Saturday. The 20-city tour
took in $75 million despite giving out an
estimated $l million worth of free passes

Label change sought

Washington, D. C.
(AP) Some people in the hard liquor

business think they’ve come up with a way

to make their product more palatable to

I the baby-boom generation, but first they

have to persuade the government to
change labeling laws.

Their idea is “light liquor," bottled
spirits with lower alcohol content. fewer
calories and more appeal to younger peo-

' pie, who are leading to avoid hard liquor.

The problem is that the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms requires
any liquor that is less than 40 percent
alcohol, or 80 proof, to be labeled
"diluted" — a designation that turns off
buyers.

So the Heublein Spirits Group, a sub-
sidiary of R.J. Reynolds Industries, asked
the bureau to allow it to market “light” or

"mild" whiskeys below the 80 proof
minimum without the “diluted” label.

Statewide

Conspiracy charged

Albany
(AP) A former state assemblman and three
other men have been indicted by a grand
jury on accusations that they tried to steal
at least $250,000 from the state by in-
flating the cost of an AIDS research pro-
ject, authorities said Monday.

Those charged in the indictment are:
former Assemblyman Stephen Greco, 65,
of Buffalo; John Natarelli, 27, of
Rensselaer; Pasquale Natarelli, 74, of Buf-
falo, identified as the uncle of John
Natarelli; and John Szczesniak, 33, of
Troy.

The four surrendered to atithoritics and
were to be arraigned later today in Albany
County Court, said Ronald (loldstock.
director of the stale Organized Crime Task
Force.

Testimonies conflict

New York (‘ity
(AP) CBS producer George Crile resumed
his testimony Monday in retired (icn.
William C. Westmoreland‘s $l20 million
libel suit, giving jurors an account that dii~~
fered sharply from last week’s testimony
by former Defense Secretary Robert
McNamara.

Crile produced the 1982 documentary.
“The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam
Deception," which accused Westmorclund
of trying in I967 to prevent information
about enemy strength frotn reaching Presi»
dent Lyndon B. Johnson and others in
Washington.

Westmoreland, who commanded US.
forces in Vietnam from I964 to 1968,
deliberately understated the size of the
enemy in order to make it appear that US.
forces were winning the war, the broadcast
charged.

 

 

 

Correction

In the Friday December 7, I984 issue of
the Albany Student Press, Campus Life
Director James Doellefeld was quoted out
of context in an article entitled, “SUNYA
officials foresee 2i.“

Doellefeld was quoted as commenting
on current alcohol policy when in fact he
was illustrating a point regarding changes
the campus will face if the slate drinking
age is raised to 21.

TUESDAY, DECEMBER II. 1984 D ALBANY STUDENT PRESS 3 '

Committee rejects alternate drop/add policies

Ian Clements
srxrr warren

Student representatives suf-
fered a serious setback Tuesday in
their push for a repeal of a new
add/drop policy known as the
‘W’, approved last spring.

After reveiwing the new policy,
a University Senate committee
recommended that no changes be
make in the policy which is
scheduled to go into effect in the
Fall of 1985.

The Committee on Academic
Standing reached its decision by a
7-0-1 vote last Tuesday after con-
sidering numerous proposals and
ideas concerning the policy.

The new policy which was pass-
ed by the Senate last spring moves
the add deadline from the sixth
day of classes to the tenth. The
drop deadline will remain near the
midlermpoint but students who
drop after the tenth day will have
a “W” on their transcripts under
the new policy.

The committee's recommenda-
tions were submitted to the
Senate’s Undergraduate
Academic Council. The counil's
cltair, Cathy LaSusa had asked
the committee to study the policy.

One of the proposals to change
the policy was submitted by Stu-
dent Association’s Committee on
Academic Affairs (A-Comm).
Asserted Mike Miller, A-Comm's
chair, “SA is committed to
fighting the ‘W’ as long as it
lakes." The committee's deci«
sion, he said, “is not such a
super-major setback."

SA will try to bring the issue
onto the Senate floor next

semester, he said. “We never ex-
the Committee on

ected

  

Academic Standing or the
Undergraduate Academic Coun-
cil to look at (the ‘W’). At least
We’ve got people talking about
problems with the plan," Miller
said.

A-Comm’s proposal called for
an add deadline on the tenth day,
and a drop deadline at the ﬁfth
week, with no “W's” to be put
on a transcript when a student
drops.

SA -President Rich Schaffer
said SA may attempt to bring an
alternative to the new policy to
the Senate ﬂoor through the
Senate's Executive Committee.
Both Schaffer and SA Vice Presi-
dent Suzy Aulelta are members of
that committee.

Scltaffer said he will discuss the
policy with University President
Villcent O’Leary when O'Leary
returns front a leave ofabsence in
Yugoslavia in January.

According to Schaffer,
O'Leary “thought we should
work for a compromise so
students wouldn’t feel that (the
new policy) was railroaded down
their throats.” O'Leary, said
Schaffer, was aware “that
students weren't happy" with the
new policy.

Committee on Academic Stan-
ding chair Jonathan Barlow said
the drop/add deadline on the
tenth day gives students enough
time to know whether a course is
rigltt for them.

After ten days “you ought to
be able to get a handle on an in-
structor's ability to lecture, what
the course is going to be struc-
tured like" and what type of
student-teacher interaction there
will be he said.

“I really don’t think it's impor-
tant whether (the ‘W’) is perceiv-
ed as a penalty. I don't think
that‘s the issue involved," he
said. Students will see it as a
penalty regardless of the commit-
tee's recommendations, he
explained.

Barlow said he did not see the
“W’s” that he received when he
was a student as harmful to his
academic record. “To have 4.5,
or 6 (‘W’s’) is no big deal," he
claimed. However a graduate
school admissions officer who

sees 20 or 25 "W’s" on a stu-
dent's transcript will ask whether
sttcll a student is a “quilter,” he
said.

Steven Rubin, a student
member of the committee, was
the sole abstention during the
vote on whether to recommend
changes in the new policy.

Rubin said he initially sup-
ported a proposal to allow each
student to drop one course each
semester without receiving a
“W.” All drops after the first
would result in a “W' placed on a

student’s transcript, according to
this proposal which was submit-
ted by two studenl members of
the Senate, lrwin Weinslcin and
Andrew Wigler.

Rubin said he found this alter-
native to be infeasible because the
computer system could not ban-
dle a program with one “penalty-
free drop" and because of “other
shortages in other areas."

Weinstcin said he will continue
his efforts to ltave the Senate
reconsider the policy. D

As the academic year winds down, the
University has geared up to provide as.
much study space as possible, for
students. From today until Friday Dec.
21, several areas have been designated a
“quiet study space."

SUN YA Computer deal gets
Apple, IBM product savings

By Bette Dzamba
.5I'.\Il'l\'RllI:'R

Apple and IBM computers will be of«
l'ercd to SUNYA students at savings of tip
to sixty percent off the retail price under
agreements reached by the University and
the two computer companies.

“You couldn't get this kind of deal even
if you had an uncle in the computer
business," said Stephen Ragowski,
SUNYA Microcomputer Acquisition Pro-
gram director.

Ragowski explained that exact discounts
will depend on the computer purchased.

As an example of tile savings offered,

Rngowski cilcd Apple's Macintoslt coni- v

plltcr with certain software, two disc
drives, monitor, and mouse is available for
$l,225 plus tax and handling. “The retail
price of the same package is $2,]95,“ he
noted, adding '_‘thal's a $900 (in) savings."

The handling charge is expected to be'

around $l25, said Ragowski.

Francis Lees, assistant vice-president for
'l'elccommunicalions and Information
Systems explained that the handling fee
covers a variety of "extras" that the
University ntust provide, including
demonstration sites, staff to assemble and
test the computers, at least 20 hours worth
of instruction to buyers, and a service
contract.

According to Ragowski, all faculty,
staff and students are eligible to purchase
the IBM computers, but. he added, "Ap~
pie requires that students carry 12 credits
and that faculty attd staff are halftime or
better."

“Faculty can use grant money or private
funds for the purchase. bttt state money
cannot be used, Ragowski noted.

“Anything in the IBM personal com-
puter line is available," said Ragowski.
“The discount is available for the Apple

Macintosh anti Lisa computers, he said,
noting “We are willing to negotiate with
other companies such as Hewlett-Packard
and leading Edge.“ He also said, "We‘d
like to hear from sltldenls Wlltil their par-
ticular favorites are."

Computers must be paid for when the
order is placed, Ragowski said, adding
that the contract delivery time is 642
weeks. "The product will be tested to be
sure no damage occurred during shipping.
and then delivered directly to llte student,"
Ragowski \itllcd.

"Macintosh," according to Ragowski,
“is Apple's newest entry into tltc market,"
He said that ~ it boasts “spectacular
graphics dtie to its high resolution"
monitor. He also said that it has “very
easy-lo-use software."

IBM, according to Ragowski, is “the
standard." He noted that “everything (on
the computer market) is-JBM
compatible."

' R'agowski also noted that schools such
as Drcxci and Stevens require thatlevery

student have a tnicro. “We have access to ‘

the software they've developed. including
things such as computer dating," he‘
added.

According to Lees. the acquisition pro—
gram is a project of the newly organized
Telecommunicalons attd Information
Systems Office at SUNYA. which in-
tegrates the work of the Computing
Center, the Educational Communications
Center, Office of Automation, the
telephone system, and Library Computing
systems. Lees said that another project of
the new area will be the purchase of a new
main frame computer to replace the
University's current SPERRY UNIVAC.
model. C]
