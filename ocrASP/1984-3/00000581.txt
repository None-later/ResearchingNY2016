EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

Students on a University Aux-
iliary Services’ (UAS) meal plan
can now ' :tiate their palates
with a new low ie dinner en-
tree, “On the i in: Sit..."

UAS Food ‘ ervice and the
food committee SugLvStEd the low
calorie, nutritional meal in an at-
tempt to offer more variety while
meeting student needs.

Students were asked about
their preferences. and UAS found
that students felt meals are too
heavy, said Director of UAS
Food Service. Ronald Clough.

“Sometimes you don’t want a
heavy meal and then you can have
a salad or a sandwich," said
General Manager gOf UAS E.
Norbert Zahm. ‘

"A lot of students are trying to
cut down on their weight." said
Zahm. “So we've even placed
scales in Dutch and Indian Quad
dining halls for students to weigh
themselves. “A sign above the
scales reads ‘is the Litc'Sidc work-
ing'?” noted Zahm.

An employee at UAS expressed
fears, however, that ‘On the Lite
Side’ would increase the food

“Variety does not necessarily

might move labor around to keep

“We hope to absorb the cost,"
said Zahm. adding “There isn’t
anything we buy that won’t
change in cost from day to day.

Karcnga notes black values crisis

By Bette Dzamba
S'I'AI-I" WRII'ISR

“The key problem for blacks today,” thundered
Dr. Maufena Karcnga, originator of the black
cultural holiday Kwanza, “is a crisis in values and
vision." :;

Karcnga dclivcrcd’a fiery speech Saturday night
about the importance of black unity and communi-
ty development. His words were punctuated by ap-
plause and cxciamations of “Oh yeah" and
“That‘s the truth" from the audience of approx-
imately 30 people. Karcnga’s appearance, in the
Performing Arts Center, was co-sponsored by the
Albany State University Black Alliance (ASUBA)
and Speaker‘s Forum.

“Blacks need a historical and world view,"
asserted Karcnga, explaining, “in the ghetto if one
is told that he has done nothing he believes it,"
Karcnga boomed.

“Ghetto life diminishes vision," asserted
Karcnga, defining vision as " an effective grasp of
black society in the world."

“Despite the ideas given by Richard Burton and
Elizabeth Taylor movies, the Egyptians were black.
We are the fathers and mothers of human civiliza-
tion,” he said.

Values, according to Karcnga consist of commit-
ment, priorities and human possibility. “Commit-
ment is what is dear, priority. what is first. These
two dictate human possibility," he said.

Karcnga explained that when he developed
Kwanza be searched to see what gave Africans a
sense of unity. He came up with a set of collective
values which he calls Nguzo Sabe, the seven
principles.

He posed the questions “Suppose you had access
to education and didn't know what to use it for,"
and “suppose you had money but didn't know
what to spend it on?" to illustrate the importance
of values.

Singers Michael Jackson and Prince, Karcnga
maintained. are popular among whites because they
are “mascots.” He said that Michael Jackson has it
“gender problem" bttt is popular among whites
because they resent black masculinity and like to
humiliate the black man.

Kurenga described the seven Swahilitut principles
he is known for creating. They are unity. self-
tlctcrminntion, collective responsibility. cooperative
economics, purpose creativity, and faith.

Unity, according to Karcnga, involves "teaching
people to have the obligation of making philosophy
and action coincide." He cited tltc Egyptian pro-
verb “if your tongue and heart are always in hur-

mony none of your plans will go astray." As an ex-
ample of people who are not in unity, he spoke of
people who say that Africa is their homeland and
speak of African culture but vacations in Europe.

Karcnga also charged that unity must begin bet-
ween husband and wife and then continue up
through the family. neighborhood, community, na—
tion and world.

"The first act of free people is to define the world
in their own image," said Karcnga. This, he said, is
the idea behind the sccottd principle. self-
dctcrmination. “We must propose an alternative
human paradigm," he charged. “Europe has
enslaved humanity, we must start a new history,"
he said. "You can make your history or let it hap-
pen," he bellowed. “1 say make it;" Karcnga
asserted.

Karcnga illustrated the importance of collective
rcsponsibllty by saying, “lfonc black is a nigger all
blacks are niggers...black freedom is indivisiblc."

Cooperative economy is necessary because
“capitalism enslaved us" said Karcnga. Karcnga
chided, “people lack a sense of purpose...black
people could free this country from oppression."
He offered Kwanza as a solution to this pur-
poselessness. “Kwanza introduces values against
the crass materialism and purposclessness of
American life."

He challenged the audience to “develop
discipline because without discipline there is no
development and no greatness."

Calling blacks “the builders of the
pyramids...the inventors of paper and the calen-
dar" he chided them for taking that legacy “to the
football field."

“The European doesn't want you to think" he
bellowed.

in speaking of creativity. Karcnga said that "to
be in God‘s image is to be a creator not destruc-
tive." He challenged the audience to “be creative
and build something new."

The last principle, Karcnga discussed is faith.
Karcnga told the listeners to have faith in the im-
portance of their call. He challenged them to "step
back on tile stage of human history as a free. proud
und productive people," and also to “never accept
the minimum when you can do the maximum.“

Karcnga concluded “our duty is to take these
principles develop a new paradigm for humanity. to
develop an alternative tutd bring it into be-
ing." Kttrengu is the Executch Director of the In-
stitute of Pan African Studies in Los Angclcs. He
has taught Black Studies and Social Change ut
