COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE) Despite a
hree-decadc upturn in the number of
omen earning PhDs. a new study showed
» en with doctoral degrees still far out-
'umbcr women in most fields.

Women Phds. moreover. have a tougher
ime finding jobs and earning promotions

The researchers studied academic hiring
atterns. and even submitted two versions
fa resume—one with a man’s name. the
ther with a woman's--for a college
caching position. “The male was
valuatcd as deserving an associate pro-
essorship." reported Florence Geis. a
nivcrsity of Delaware psychologist who
o-authored the study. “The female was
valuated for only an assistant
rofcssorship."
"It’s a subtle discrimination," she said.
‘Women are not seen as intelligent.”

There are more women with doctorates
to suffer discrimination, too. In l97l.
'womcn carried only 14.3 percent of all doc-
oral degrees. the National Center for
IEducation Statistics (NCES) said. The
numbers jumped to 24.3 percent in 1977.
This year. the NCES expects women will
earn 37 percent. or I2.400 of the 33,600
_PhDs granted nationwide.

t One reason for the male dominance is

"it “self selection." Gcis explained. "Until a

 few years ago, many more men than

I  women chose to go to grad school." Evcn

 

 now. wotncn grad students tend to opt for
 certain disciplines.
Whilc women now get a slight majority

 of the doctorates awarded in English.

French. and German. they also are "gci—

ting a higher and higher proportion of the
degrees in other social sciences.” says Judy
Touchton of the American Council on
Education's Ofﬁce of Women in Higher
Education. “We can certainly say the
percentage of women PhDs in the
biological and physical sciences is going
up. too." she added.

The increasing percentages are en-
couraging. researcher Geis admits. but
women PhDs still are rare in most tradi-
tionally male disciplines. Despite a 100
percent enrollment increase of women in
law. only two percent of all law PhDs are
earned by women, she pointed out.

“Unintentional discrimination" by
university admissions officers often
diminishes the ranks of women doctoral
candidates. Gcis noted. A Stanford
University study suggests colleges combat
discrimination by informing female
students when they score higher on
Graduate Record Exams than male
graduate students. Such information cotild
increase women’s self-confidence and
assertiveness, the study claimed.

After graduation, however. Geis's study
revealed women PhDs are five times more
likely than men to be unemployed. Promo-
tions and pay raises. as well. are offered
more often to men. "It's a perceptual
bias." Gcis said. "What most people ex-
poet is what they see."

But these perceptions are changing slow-
ly as the number of highly placed female
role models increases. Gcis affirmed.
“When you change the frequency of high-
status role models. you change expecta—
tions." she stated.

ed. “I‘m doing less work here and getting

Eddie Vaccaro a senior who transferred
from University of Florida noticed the dif-

"Classes are so much more compctctive,
especially in the business school. It seems
that every time you take a test your future

 is on the line. At University of Florida you
 could just take a business class, pass it and

be in the business school."
Most transfer students agreed that
.. SUNYA is a highly competitive University.

 Bonnie Silvcrman a transfer from Brandeis

Brandeis I would leave behind the cut-
throat pro-med and pro-law students. in
my other classes at SUNYA i don't find
the compctctivcncss that you see in the
business classes."

Jim Davis ti transfer from Nassau Com-

the compctctivc atmosphere at SUNYA.

Greg Behrendt. a transfer from Stony
Brook found SUNYA faculty fairly ac-
cessible in comparison to those at Stony
Brook. “At Stony Brook things were very
impersonal. There were waiting lists to see
professors. you couldn’t just walk in."
Some transfers found SUNYA pro-
fcssors not as individualistic and caring. “I
liked my professors better at Queens,"
said one transfer student. "They really
carcd about thcr students there. I don't
find that here at Albany." she added.

Fcldman. coming from Cornell Univer-
sity. found that the professors at Albany
were “willing to help but they didn't seem
like they wanted to be teaching in a
classroom. I think that the professors at
Cornell were better at lecturing. and much
more captivating speakers.” he added.

“I think the professors at Albany ask
Icss original thought from their students.
SUNYA students don‘t critically look at
the positions they hold, a lot of them got

Transfer students generally said they
were not intimidated by the size of the
classes at SUNYA.
