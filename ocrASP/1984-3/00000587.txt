COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE) Despite a
hree-decade upturn in the number of

women earning PhDs. a new study showed
men with doctoral degrees still far out-
‘ number women in most ﬁelds.

Women Phds. moreover. have a tougher

time ﬁnding jobs and earning promotions

The researchers studied academic hiring
patterns, and even submitted two versions

"The male was

“It's a subtle discrimination." she said.

. “Women are not seen as intelligent."

There are more women with doctorates

women earned only l4.3 percent of all doc-
toral degrees, the National Center for

V’ «This year, tltc NCES expects women will
‘ggcarn 37 percent, or 12,400 of tltc 33,600
'3‘ PhDs granted nationwide.

One reason for the male dominance is
"self sclcction," Gels explained. "Until it
few years ago. many more men than
women chose to go to grad school.” Even
now, wontcn grad studcttts tend to opt for
ccrtain disciplines.

ting a higher and higher proportion of the
degrees in other social sciences," says Judy
Touchton of the American Council on
Education's Office of Women in Higher
Education. “We can certainly say the
percentage of women PhDs in the
biological and physical sciences is going
up, too." she added.

The increasing percentages are en-
couraging, researcher Gels admits, but
women PhDs still are rare in most tradi- I
tionally male disciplines. Despite a 100 ‘
percent enrollment increase of wonicn in
law. only two percent of all law PhDs are
earned by women. she pointed out.

"Unintentional discrimination" by
university admissions officers often
diminishes the ranks of women doctoral

candidates, Geis noted. A Stanford

 

University study suggests colleges combat
discrimination by informing female
students when they score higher on
Graduate Record Exams than male
graduate students. Such information could
increase womcn’s self-confidence and
assertiveness. the study claimed.

After graduation. however. Gcis's study
rcvcalcd women PhDs are five times more
likely than men to be ttncmploycd. Promo-
tions and pay raises, as well, are offered
tnorc often to men. "It's a perceptual
bias." Gcis said. “What most people ex-
pcct is what tltcy see."

But thcsc perceptions are changing slow-
ly its the ttttmbcr of ltigltly placed fcmztlc
role models increases. Gels affirmed.
“When you change the frequency of high-
status role ntodcls. you cltangc expecta-

that it isn‘t as pressured here."

William Feldman, a junior who
transferred from Cornell University
because of financial reasons asserted.
"SUNYA is a lot more like high school
than college. I'm used to a more serious
approach than here at SUNYA." He add-
ed, “I'm doing less work here and getting
barter grades than at Cornell."

Eddie Vaccaro a senior who transferred
from University of Florida noticed the dif-
fcrence in the students classroom attitudes.
“Classes are so much more competetive,
especially in the business school. It seems
that every time you take a test your future
is on the line. At University of Florida you
could just take a business class. pass it and
be in the business school."

Most transfer students agreed that
SUNYA is a ltigltly competitive University.
Bonnie Silvcrman a transfer frotn Brandeis
University said. “in all of my business
classes there is n ridiculotts amount of cut-
lltroat tactics. i thought when I left
Brandeis I would leave bcltind tltc cut-
throat prc-mcd and prc—law students. ltt

education at their first school were pleased
with the faculty and classes at SUNYA.
Greg Bchrendt. a transfer from Stony
Brook found SUNYA faculty fairly ac-
ccssiblc in comparison to those at Stony
Brook. “At Stony Brook things were very
impersonal. There were waiting lists to see
professors, you couldn't just walk in."
Some transfers found SUNYA pro-
fcssors not as individualistic and caring. “I
liked my professors better at Queens."
said one transfer student. “They really
cared about thcr students there. I don’t
find that here at Albany,” she added.

Fcldman. coming from Cornell Univer-
sity, found that the professors at Albany
were “willing to ltclp bttt they didn't seem
like tltcy wanted to be teaching itt a
classroom. I think that the professors at
Cornell were better ttl lecturing, and muclt
more captivating speakers.“ he added.

“I thittk the professors at Albany ask
less original thought front their students.
SUNYA students don‘t critically look at
tltc positions thcy hold, a lot of them got
their opinions frotn Mommy and Daddy."
Fcldman asserted.

Trnnsfcr students gcncrnlly said they
were not intimidated by the size of tltc
clztsscs at SUNYA.

"Classes at Albany are it little tttorc dif-
