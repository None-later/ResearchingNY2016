Russian panelists offer glimpses

<Front Page

slogan is ‘the louder the'better.‘ The se-
cond group likes British new wave like
Duran Duran, Culture Club and the
Police. Sometimes you meet punks with
dyed hair and pins, but I say they look like
ordinary people compared to New York
punks," he said.

“There are still some old hippies who
like the Kinks. Rolling Stones. Led Zep-
pelin. and a lot of people like King Crim-
son and Pink Floyd." Zinenko said. The
Russian musical groups are mostly new
wave. and “most of them try to imitate
groups like the Police and Culture Club."

In an interview after the discussion.
Nechaev comented ont his year's students
form Thorez. “They're doing pretty well,
and their teachers are satisﬁed with their
performance. Some of their teachers say
they’re the best group they’ve ever had.”
A few reasons for that. Nechaev said. are
that “they have a good command of
English and were better prepared for the
trip. I think their general outlook is

broader. and they're not as tense as the
other groups."

The best aspects of this exchange.
Nechaev said. are “that they have become
proficient in their English and can express
sophisticated ideas. We should not
underestimate the value of gaining first—
hand information about a different way of
life. This exchange helps break some bias-
ed attitudes — it goes both ways."

When asked if they had found anything
about Americans different from their ex-
pectations. Leonid Muratov replied that
when we were in the Soviet Union we im-
agined (the typical American) as a very
young man in jeans and a t-shirt. maybe
with long hair. I also thought more
Americans smoked."

“We’re really touched by the hospitality
and friendliness" which they've en-
countered, Kasyanov said. “People have
been very nice." The Soviet students and
their adviser are scheduled to travel during
winter break and depart for Moscow
January l7. D
