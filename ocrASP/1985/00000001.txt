If Mario (homo made a New Year’s

resolution to~help four 'year college

students in New York, he certainly manag- '

ed to fulﬁll it when he announced his 1985
budget proposal. '

The $38.4 billion budget. which now has
to be passed by the state legislature. calls
for no SUNY tuition or room cost in-
creases. and grants the preliminary funds
for the planning of a SU NYA fieldhouse.

According to Thomas Guiley. Principal
Budget Examiner. “One million dollars
was allocated and if the proposed budget
goes through planning will commence" on
the Fieldhouse.

The project could be finished within two
years. "The planning process takes about
one year." he said, “and construction also
takes about that long." ‘

$500,000 was allocated for n SUNYA
“bubble” which would serve as a tem-
porary fieldhouse until the actual structure
is ready. “This construction ‘should be
ﬁnished by. the beginning of summervand‘
will be dismantled when fieldhouse con-
struction‘begins,” Guiley said, adding that
the "bubble" would then be moved to a
campus that has no plans for a fieldhouse.

Additionally. $10"million dollars has
been proposed to fund dormitory projects

on three SUNY campuses- —'.-—‘ 

Stony Brook. and Purchase.» “The eitact

splitting of'the money will be left to the '
Board of Trustees but they stated that the ~

money is enough for only two' out of‘the
three campuses.” ‘

SUNYA Vice President-for University"

Affairs Lewis 'Welch said that no decision

was likely as to which campus will receive ‘ .
the .' '

additional housing until after
legislature passes the budget proposal.
'He also stated that the proposed
fieldhouse. which would be paid for
through State University construction

Fund bonds. would probably-contain a.

Widespread attention has been
focused on the SUNY system
these past few weeks with the
release of a report by the Indepen-
dent Commission on the Future
of SUNY. and the coverage may
be only the ﬁrst step in a process
leading to sweeping changes in

New York’s public higher 

tion system. ‘ .r - , ..

“A fundamental .change .in
SUNY’s structure is required to
allow the university to‘c‘arry out
the functions for which it was
created," the report states.

The results of a November off-campus housing
survey point to an estimated 1,100 SUNYA
students "living illegally and in violation of the
Grouper Law," according to Director of Off-
Campus Housing Karleen Karlson.

Karlson said the survey was conducted to obtain
an accurate estimate of SUNYA students living in
violation of the city-wide law. The survey also sug-
gested possible housing options and made an at-
tempt to understand present student living
conditions. a

unﬁlled."

‘- The report concludes. “There
is a clear'choice before New York:
the state can decide that New
York is not going to get a public
university of high quality or it can
change the rules."

. The Commission suggests that
the new rules include changing the
management of SUNY from a
state agency to a “public beneﬁt
corporation.” According to the
report. f‘We have explored other
alternatives but believe that the

form of the public benefit corr‘

poration provides the most feasi-

ble way to give SUNY’s Board of

Trustees, chancellor. and state-
operatedl campuses the "responr

sibility and authority that a

University requires and that their

. counterparts in other: states

possess." -

Public benefit corporations
(PBC) have been created in the
past to perform particular scr-
vices in the‘public‘interest. The
Thruway Authority and Port
Authority of New York and New
Jersey are both PBC’s; ‘

A memo distributed at the
January meeting of the SUNY
Board of Trustees stated that
there were 104 public authorities-

‘ereated by .statute in New York

SUNY would. however. be able

'to better recruit talented faculty
and administrators. plan for the)
future. maximisevresources. and
develop research potential as an

independent corporation. the

commission's report says. .

SUNYA President Vincent
O'Leary said “.The idea of a
Public Benefit Corporation is not
to escape accountability. we have
to be accountable for our actions.
1 hope there will be a means
whereby SUNY can be held ac~
countable in a more efficent and
flexible way. This will be'better
for SUNY. the state. and the
students." ‘

in addition to changing the
type of controlhthe state exercises
over SUNY, the report made
other recommendations for
strengthening SUNY's contribu-
tion to the state. These include
“recruitment of outstanding
faculty members who can
themselves attract other faculty
m6mbers‘a‘nd_top
students...enhanced' nationwide
student recruiting efforts and the
improvement and modernization
of facilities."

The report also encourages the
recruitment of' minority high

school‘stndents'and efforts to in- ~

terest undergraduate minority
students in graduate studies. A
need to “strengthen the functions
of research and graduate and pro~
fessional' education" was also
cited.

in a memo titled. “lnitial Reac-
tion from the University at
Albany." O’Leary said "We
pledge that Albany will continue
to emphasize its premiere
undergraduate experience and to
foster. graduate programs in
selectedflelds promising national-
etnminence. such as atmospheric

~seienees.- creative writing. and

public policy studies." [3
