the Rathskeilar. SUNYA’s on- . .

campus pub. hadn't drawn more
than 30 students all evening and
planned to close in half an hour.

This actually wasn't an unusual;

turnout according. to a waitress
'there who, reported that one
Saturdaynight last semester she

. took home only 35 cents in tips.
The Rathskellar. Which ,has‘

been sufferins declining sales for

about two. years now. offers a ' v"

what does downtown offer that
the Rat doesn’t have? “People,”
asserts Sydney Gilbert, a waitress
in the Rat.

“it‘s like a cycle.” explained-

Brian Westerveit, a bouncer in the
Rat. “if everyone's goingrto the
Rat then it will become the place
to go."

That's exactly what University
Auxiiliary Services, which runs
the Rat, hopes to accomplish this
Thursday night, at Save-the-Rat
Nite. which runs from 7:00 pm.
til closing at 12:30.

They‘ll be giving out T-shirts,
hats. and pins while beer. hot
dogs. and chicken wings will be
sold at reduced prices.

Eric Holzberg and _Ross
Abeiow, both student members
of the UAS board of directors.
came up with the idea of holding
a save-the-Rat night, and have
sent letters out to Student
“Association group leaders urging
them to come? to Save-thc-Rat
Nite and consider. holding a group
ievent there.

of its business. ’

in the ﬁscal year beginning July
1981 and ending July ’82 the Rat
took in $234,000 in sales. The
following year. during which the
drinking age went up to 19, sales
declined to $206,610. in the next
year, sales dropped to $157,443.

After the drinking age went up,
several steps were taken. in an efe
fort to bring in increased sales.
said Rathskeilar manage: Jay Mc-
Clure. Non-alcoholic beer was
served at a reduced price and a
designated driver program, offer-
ing f'ree soda all night to anyone
who has to drive home and agrees
not to drink any alcoholic
beverages was instituted, Mc-
Clure added.

Several local bands were also'
hired. In addition, McClure said.
different drinks were “put on
special.” This however. met with
little success because university
guidelines prohibit the Rat from
promoting alcohol.

' Students hanging out in the Rat

say the 19-year-old drinking age is '

only part of the reason for declin-
ing sales. “There's too. many
other options." explained Amy
Danz. Also, she said. the Rat

lacks the atmosphere of other ‘

bars.

“The band's too loud and. no
one's here to listen to it," asserted
Christine ,Daniggilis. adding.
“The people make the bar more
than anything else." El
