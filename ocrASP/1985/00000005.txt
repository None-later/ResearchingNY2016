Ed Kelly, 21

It would be impossible to
honor Ed Kelly, age 21, of
Deer Park, Long Island in
only a few words. On
Thursday, January 24,
1985, he suffered a fatal
cerebral hemorrhage. A
business major, lacrosse
and rugby player, Ed will
always be remembered by
his classmates, teammates,
and many friends as so- ‘
meone who truly knew how
to enjoy life. He brought
much fun and happiness to:
everyone he touched.

NYPIRG panel provides

By James 0'3ulllvan '
NEWSEDIIUR

While most college students
were enjoying the luxury of in-
tercession break, about 100

'students were in Albany January ‘

II and 12 at the 1985 NYPIRG
Legislative Conference learning
about state government and
’discussing lobbying tactics.

Eitecutive Director of the En-
vironmental Planning Lobby
Judy Enck‘ told the group at a
panel discussion Saturday how
her organization works to get
legislation passed.

She stressed the importance of
coalition building and working
with sympatheticlegislators close-
ly and also holding media events

to help reach out for grass roots
support. Widespread community
support, Enck said, can be more
important than actual lobbying.

Coalitions can help- develop
grass roots sUpport. as well as get
a piece of legislation more con-
sideration. “A sponsor will take a
bill more seriously if there’s five
or six groups coming in instead of
one," she explained. _

Visibility is important in any
lobbying campaign, Enck added,
and suggested letter writing lef-
forts andcaII-in radio shows as
ways to promote awareness of an
issue. '

Margo Thomas. Counsel to the

,Assembly ques Committee and

 

a second panelist, urged the group
to create momentum for an issue.
“Keep at it--pin them(legislators)
down" on an issue, she said.

Enck suggested addressing
local garden clubs and communi-
ty groups of which a legislator's
spouse is a member as an addi-
tional tactic. but Thomas pointed
out that sympathetic legislators
are usually “less militant” than
lobbyists when working on an
issue.

“Letters are important, phone
calls are important," Thomas
said. suggesting that lobbyists
keep a list of contact persons in
each legislator's office. “Go to
the office - follow it up."

Successful formation of Greek Council

may‘boo‘st role of social frats at SUNYA '

The NYPIRG(New York
Public Interest Research Group)
Board of Directors held their
January meeting at the con-
ference as well, and voted in favor
of an anti-Star Wars system
resolution and an economic
divestment from South Africa

project.

NYPIRG's opposition to the

I proposed Star Wars weapons, of-

ﬁcially known as the Strategic
Defense Initiative, is in character
with the organization’s previous

at SUNYA Project Coordinator .

Bob Jaffe told the Board. The
resolution passed l4»0-3.

A lenthy debate in which New
York State’s divestiture from
South Africa was discussed and

questioned as to its effects on the
blacks who are oppressed by the
country's apartheid resulted in a
.motion, which passed I4-2-l, to
fund a research project and a
campus project on divestiture.

The importance of lobbying
was stressed by the moderator of
Saturday's panel discussion, Ar-
thur Malbin, director of the Ad-
vocacy Training Center, when he
told the audience that only about
ﬁve percent of the bills introduc-
ed each year in the state legislator
ever become law.

NYPIRG serves an important
function in New York, Enck said,
because “there are very few
groups out there who actually
lobby the legislature” in the
public interest.

 

'By David Kase '
Greek life may become a greater part of the
SUNYA social scene if all goes well when fraternity

- and sorority presidents discuss the possible forma-

tion of a Greek Council this Friday.

During the past year, many new fraternities and
sororities have been formed, Student Association
Programming Director Patty 'Salkin reported,
asserting, “fraternities and sororities should com-
municate with each other what is going on around
campus and to plan effective events that don’t
conflict‘.” '

Salkin said‘, “We are going in very open minded;
we don’t have any set plans. It is all up to the
presidents at the meeting to decide what they want
to do.”

She added the SA “is here to help them, and we
are certainly willin to work together."

SA President, Rich Schaffer said. “We would
like to tap the resources available from,.the frater-
nities and soroitites for the betterment of the
Campus?" .   , ,,  .

Director of Campus Life, .Iim Doellefeld said,.

ii‘We (the administration) look forward to the for-
mation and development of Greek letter organiza-
tions: we believe that they will contribute positively
to campus life." ’

Alpha Epsilon Pi President Rob Segall said that
“the proper formation of an inter-Greek council
will not only help to put a check on the fraternities
and sororities.. .but will bring closeness and unity to
these groups, which is what Greek life is based
upon.” He also added that SA is being “more than
helpful" in encouraging such a council.

According to Doellefeld, there is a procedure to
be followed in order to become a recognized Greek -
organization at SUNYA. Initially, a fraternity or
sorority would have to meet with Director of Stu-
dent Activities Jessica Casey to discuss the group's
reason for organizing and apply for temporary
recognition to entitle them to reserve university
space.

If the organization is successful, it may then app-
ly for provisional recognition, which would lead to
a two year probationary period offer which Vice
President of Student Affairs Frank Pogue would
decide whetherror not to grant ofﬁcial recognition.

‘, Alpha Epsilon Pi PledgeMaster, Andy Roths- 

tein. said that there is currently no fraternity hous- ’ ‘
ing, but, “We are actively looking for a frat house.
There are certain areas in Albany where we are able
to getaround the grouper law, and it would be a
step forward for all frats if we could set up a frater-
nity row. We are hoping to have a house as early as
the fall of 1986."
