make it difficult for_ a student to see
SUNYA as a personalised institution.

_ With 16,000 students attending
SUNYA, ways of personalizing the school
can be hard to ﬁnd. Administration of-
ﬁcials say they took a step in the right
direction last summer by forming an
educational development task force to
review university programs and increase
'. faculty/student involvement.

“The more you can personalize the

crease the interaction between students
and faculty. has a very positive affect on
the persistence of students. their aspiration
level, their sense of pride in the University,
(and) their commitment,” explained Task
Force Chair Barbara Schoonmaker. Direc-
tor of Research and Educational Develop-
. ment for Student Affairs. A
She also said she believed the same was
' true for faculty and staff. and that the
icreased involvement creates a more
pleasurable environment for all, and can
even decrease such anti-social behavior as
. r vandalism. .

President for Student Affairs Frank
Pogue. and. Schoonmaker said. was an
outgrowth of the, first annual Student Af-
fairs Summer Retreat held last July for 102
students. faculty and administrators. ,_

At least two of the three students on the

Task Force were appointed by Pogue. and ’

attended the Summer Retreat. but Student
Association Director of Student Program-
ming Patty Salkin said the inclusion of so
few students on the 26 member committee
is a potential problem. ,

“i would have liked to see more student

involvement on the Task Force. A lot of .
the things that aregoing to be coming out

of the Task Force are going to be affecting
the students... It sems that the more
students there are sitting in one room, the
more brainstorming they can do. and they
can contribute a lot more,“ Salkin said.

The Task Force consists of 26 members -

drawn from the University community.
and is divided into four broad sub-

committees, representing the areas of .

Faculty-Student interaction, Program
Development. Student Satisfaction-Needs
Assessment. and Transitions.

Salkin, a member of the Faculty-Student
Interaction subcommittee said one of the
problems the group faced is student fears
of being lost in such a large-school. "A lot
of people, when they think about coming
to a school the size of SUNY Albany, look
at 16.000 students. and they look at the

ratio of faculty to students. they think.,

‘i’m going to get lost in such a large place,
and no one is going to pay attention to
me_. n

The Transitions Sub-committee. .
Schoonmaker said. is studying the best .

ways to bring new students into the
University. including an improved orienta-

tion and expanded summer lanning SCS-m
