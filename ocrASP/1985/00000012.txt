Marc Mereurio‘s school record perfor-
mance in the weight throw and victories by
two Danes who were competing in their
first collegiate meet led the Albany State
men‘s indoor track and field team to a
third place ﬁnish in Saturday’s Cortland
invitational.

Cortland won the five-team affair with
80 points. followed by Alfred University
(50). Albany (48), ithaca College (47) and
Binghamton (38).

Mercurio's toss of the 35-pound weight
not only destroyed the previous record of
Sl'll 3/4” he set in i983. it also surpassed
the qualifying standard for the NCAA in-
door national championships by over three
feet. The senior Ali-American heaved the
ball and handle 53'3". ,

“if i can throw 55 feet, 1 think i have a
good shot at going to the nationals," said
Mercurio.

Only the top 12 athletes who throw far-
ther than 50 feet will qualify for the
NCAA meet.

in his Dane debut. freshman Curt Wied-
man soared 13'6" to win the pole vault.
Pat Dowling, also a Dane puppy. placed
fourth with an 11’ vault.

Junior Dana Melvin. a Dane running
back during the fall. showed that he can
run without the ball too. He sprinted 6.6
seconds to win the 55-meter dash, edging
teammate Pat Saccocio (second. 6.7).

The Danes had another scorer in the
short dash. Michael Gusmano. who ﬁnish-
cd 6th in 6.8 seconds. Gusmano also an-
chored the third place 4x400 meter relay
and ran the 500~meter dash.

“He just made a strategic mistake. He
shouId have waited till the last lap to make
his move.”

-—Coach Bob M unsey

 

in recognition of his arduous “triple,”
Head Coach Bob Munsey awarded him the
“Red Feather.“ which is given to the
outstanding Albany athlete of each indoor
meet. “He had a hard day; he worked his
butt off." Munsey said.

The distance crew recorded two second
place finishes.

Ed McGill was surprised in the
5.000-meter run by Cortland's Jim
Wunseh, a recent transfer who blew away
the field.

r The race was marred by an inattentive
lap counter who forced some competitors
to run an extra lap.

Before the race. McGiil expected his

toughest opponent would be ithaca’s Jim
Quinn, winner of last fall's New York
NCAA cross-country regional. The red-
haired Bostonian let both Wunsch and

Quinn run far ahead of him. but the torrid-

pace weakened Quinn. allowing McGili to
pass him with two laps remaining and take
second place. Teammate Ray Volper was
fifth.

Freshman Pat Paul. who moved into the
‘lead of the 3.000~meter run with more than
800 meters remaining. placed second in
9:09.7. “Pat ran as good a race as anyone
has run in a long time. He just made a
strategic mistake. He should have waited
till the last lap to make his move." said

Danes ranked
second in State

By Kristine Sauer
STAFF WRITER I 1

Currently ranked "second by the R.T.
French poll for NY Division ill schools,
the Albany State women’s basketball team
had been beating teams left and right until
their eleven game winning streak was end-
ed on Saturday by St. Michaels of Ver-
mont. The Danes' record now stands at
13-2. ‘ ,

The women hoopsters played an even
game with the Division ll school. if it
weren‘t for a St. Michaels two-minute
first-half spurt, the outcome might have
been different.

The clubs' equal play showed in the ﬁnal
statistics.‘Thc Danes outrebounded their
opponents, 23-21. St. Michaels had 28 tur-
novers compared to Albany's 31. Albany
shot 45 percent from the floor. just behind
their opponent's 46 percent. St. Michaels
also attempted eleven more shots from the
floor than the Danes.

The extra field goal attempts left the
Danes came away nine points shy. trailing
78-69. As a matter of fact. they never came
closer than five points of St. Michaels.

High scorer for the game was Albany‘s
Rainny Lesanc with 23 points. 6’1"
Margaret Lynch and Becky Bouchard. a
guard. both contributed 21 points for the
Vermont school and Pam Batalis added 16
points. Kim Kosalek scored ten points for
the Danes and Diane Fernandes had 13.

“This was one of Diane’s best games of
the season,“ said Albany Head Coach
Mari Warner. St. Michaels had been put~
ting pressure on Lesane and Fernandez
took advantage of that.

As for the termination of their winning
streak Lesane said. “We could have beaten
them. We got off to a slow start."

Over the break. both Lori Bayba and
Nancy Grasso returned from injuries while
Cindy Jenson is now out with a stress frac-
ture in her foot and Maureen McBride’s

“We'll be .working out over the
semester break in order to main-
tain the same level of fitness we're
at now," had been head coach
Pat Duval-Spillane's strategy con-
cerning the Albany Women's
Gymnastics team's dual meet with
Rhode island College. The tough
regimen the women endured over
the semester break resulted in a
decisive 149.1-l37.l victory over
R.l.C.. their second straight
seasonal win. ‘

The majority of team members
had reported back for condition-
ing on Jan. 9th. Led by‘cnptain
Lynn Saravls, the women's daily
workouts included weight train-
ing. swimming. long-distance
running. and aerobics.

“it was important for us to
come back for conditioning."
remarked Junior all-urounder
Brenda Armstrong. “Most of the
team doesn't get to work out over
the winter break. and it brought
us back into the feeling of being a
team." '

it wasn‘t an easy goal to attain.

“What's the matter with you?"

haunted. discouraged looks of her
teammates. “Don't you know It's

something else besides the excr-
cises; can't you beat yourself?"

By Saturday. the team was past
beating themselves and was ready
to accept an outside challenge.
Albany took an early lead in win-
ning the first event. the vault.
38.21-37.45. R.i.C.'s Cathy Dusza
executed the most difficult vault
of the meet. a tsukahara. but
didn't have the form or control of
Albany's Sue Lcskowitz.
Leskowitz won the event scoring
an 8.3. followed by Dusza. Arm-
strong was third. scoring a 7.95.

On the second event. the
uneven parallel bars. Albany pull-
ed further ahead by substantially
outscoring R.i.C. 36.95a28.1. it
was Albany sophomore Leslie
St‘ecklc's solid. strong routine
that earned her a 7.65 from the
judges that took top individual
honors. Albany's Nora Eeliuntoni
threw in a spunky exercise featur-
ing two consecutive bcutfulls for a
7.55. and Armstrong was right
behind with a 7.5 to close out the
top. three positions. After two
events. Albany had it very corn-
manding 75.75-65.55 lead.

The Danes went into the break with an

defeated Skidmore. 78-45. At halftime
Albany was ahead. 37-23. High scorer was
Lesane with 24. A ten-point contribution

Continuing on their streak. Russell Sage

and Nancy Grasso, in her returning ball
game. both scored 14 poittts. Gt'asso had
seven rebounds.

The following game against Oswego was
an important game to Warner. "With this
game we could tell where we stand in the
West. We just played a beautiful game.
For one of the first times we played two
halves." said Warner.

Albany defeated Oswego 69-42 with ii
for 13 shooting from the line. The Danes
held Oswego's Linda Deere to tett
points. only four of which came in the first
half. Another strong Oswego player. Carla
Quinn. was held to eight points. Lesane
was high scorer again. with 21 points.

At 7:00 pm. tonight. here at Albany.
the women hoopsters face Binghamton. a”

 SUNYAC contender. The Danes defeated
them 68-56 earlier this season. Warner

feels Binghamton is a “much improved
team” and is “glad” the game is at home.

The Danes will concentrate on Helene
Thomas. a top Binghamton player. She's a
forward who plays everything except
center. Last time she was held to ten
points. only two coming in the first half.

Lesane said. “We'll have to work

'harder. They know our whole team and

who‘s a shooter and who's not. but we can
beat them again. " iii
