Iraq blasts Iran

 

Baghdad, Iraq ;
(AP) Iraqi forces Thursday launched an-
offensive against Iranian troops in the cen-
tral sector of the front line, inflicted heavy
losses and “occupied new positions,” a
military spokesman said.

It was the second offensive announced
by Iraq this week - the first time in 31 mon-
ths that Iraq has reported staging major
ground assaults along the border.

On Monday, Iraq said 40,000 of its
soldiers supported by air and artillery at~
tacked across Iranian lines in the' southern
sector of the 730‘mile front line.

USSR missile found

Helsinki, Finland
(AP) Finnish searchers Thursday found
the tail section of a Soviet missile that
crashed in Finland a month ago, and the
army denied a London newspaper report
that the missile had been headed for West
Germany and was shot down by the
Soviets.

The West German government also
denied a report in London‘s Daily Express
that during military exercises in the
Barents Sea the Soviets accidentally sent
the unarmed target missile on a course for
Bremen or Hamburg and that they shot it

 

 

 

down when they realized their mistake.

A spokesman for the West German
Defense Ministry, Lt. "Col. Norbert
Huebner, today told The Associated Press:
“The missile was not capable of reaching
such a distance. There is no basis for such
a report. It doesn't say much for the
author’s information."

Mandela may be freed

- Cape Town, South Africa
(AP) President P.W. Botha told Parlia-
ment Thursday that South Africa was
prepared to consider the release of South
Africa’s best-known black-rights leader,
Nelson Mandela. the South African Press
Association reported.

SAPA said Botha laid down the condi-
tion that Mandela, imprisoned for life for
sabotage, divorce himself: from the
violence carried out by the black-
nationalist organization he heads, the
African National Congress.

Botha’s remarks appeared to be the far-
thesttany South African government of-
ficial has gone in suggesting Mandela, 66,
might be freed.

 

 

Nationwide

Arms sales postponed

Washington
(AP) The Reagan administration has
suspended all new arms sales to the Middle

 

East pending a comprehensive review of
defense needs of Israel and moderate Arab
nations, White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said Thursday.

Speakes said the review, which is ex-

‘pected to be completed in four to six
. weeks. won’t halt shipments of spare parts

and weapons already destined for the
region.

Although Speakes declined to call the
action a suspension of sales, he said the ad-
ministration would not send any arms sales
requests to Congress while the review is
underway. ‘

Vaccine to be tested

Stanford, Calif.
(AP) An experimental vaccine that could
prevent gonorrhea, a venereal disease that
strikes a million Americans each year, will
be tested on volunteers within the next
year, researchers announced.

“If the vaccine for gonorrhea is suc-.
cessful, it would be fantastic," said Dr.
Mary Guinan of the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta. “We could make a
significant contribution to public health by
preventing 'the disease instead of just
treating it after people get it."

The vaccine is made from a cloned pro-
tein fragment that appears to produce an
immune barrier against a broad range of
gonorrhea-causing bacteria, said Dr. Gary
Schoolnik of the Stanford University
School of Medicine.

In labratory studies, it blocked gonococ-
cal bacteria from infecting human cells
with the disease, Schoolnik said Tuesday

Students review budget Vida?

By Pam Schusterman
STAFF WRITER

SUNY students probably
.won't be making the all too
familiar “Fight the Hike" treck
down to the Capitol this year
because for the first time in
several years there were no tui-
tion‘ or room
hikes in the pro- News
posed budget.

. Not only that, AnaIVSIS
but SUNYA may
ﬁnally be getting it’s long-
promised ﬁeldhouse and more
ton-campus housing.

The favorable budget follow—
ed what Steve Gawley, chair of
Central Council’s Student Ac-
tion Committee, called “an in-
credible voter turnout" by
students in the elections this past
November. '

Nearly 85 percent of the
students registered actually went
to the polls. and that, Gawley
said, has.made students a factor
to be considered, in , future
elections. ~

However, according to
Gawley, there'was no direct link
between a high voter turnout
and a favorable budget. “It is
naive to think that students
voted as a clearly defined bloc in
I984, but there‘ is deﬁnitely
some correlation between the in-
credible amounl of students that
turned out to vote" and the fact
that there is no proposed tuition
increase.

That the correlation is not
direct is proven by the com-
munity college proposed
budget, said Sue wray, presi-

dent of the Student Association , .,

York (SASU).

college students are twenty-nine- ‘

years old and they have always
had a large turnout in elections.
“They participated and they got
burned," she said, referring to
the funding cuts Cuomo propos-
‘ed they take.

Another factor, explained
Paul Herrick. Assistant
Legislative Director of the New
(York Public Interest Research

Group (NYPIRG), is the strong
economic recovery. “The
economy is doing very well, con-
sumer purchase is up and there
is a tremendous surplus of about
one billion dollars," he said.
With Cuomo‘s proposed taxcut
and increased welfare he could
not have also called for tuition
hike, Herrick added.

“Cuomo may really regret his
campaign promise of low cost
higher quality public education,
but (he) may ﬁnally be honoring.
it," Gawley said. '

"Cuomo may also be cour-
ting the new vote," said
Gawley, adding, “we are the
new crop of voters and he wants
to lock in our votes." Gawley
said he was sure the governor is
aware of the fact that “if you
are anti-student then the student
vote will be anti-you."

Cuomo- Press Ofﬁcer Bryan
Jackson said the governor has
always taken all voters seriously,
especially those with special
needs, like students.

“1 know he (Cuomo) has en-
couraged people to get involved
in the voting process, and has
supported registration drives on
campuses." Jackson said, ad-
ding that Cuomo realizes the
student vote is important; “the
beginning of our system is the
young people," he said.

However, Thomas Guiley.
Principal Budget Examiner said.
“the student vote had no effect-

within the division on how the
budget was allotted." The
Albany students alone did not
enter into the decision making
process headed up in the state
section, he said.

“As a vocal component they
are deﬁnitely considered," he
said, “but the budget is drawn
up on a much more apolitical
basis than that."

The budget, he said, is a
“priority setting process based
on much more than just one
vocal component."

However, SUNYA Political-
Sciencc Professor Roman
Hedges disagreed. “They are
setting priorities and any setting
of priorities is a political issue,"
he explained. “Cuomo wants to
make sure he has working rela-
tions with certain people,"
Hedges added.

Although the student vote
may not have been the clincher
for this budgetI it may have had
a deﬁnite effect. “For the ﬁrst
time we empowered a signiﬁcant
voter bloc of students," explain-
ed Gawiey, adding, “and the
legislature knows we have the
power to sway elections."

Wray added, "I can see a dif-
ference in the legislature
already, they are looking at and
assessing our needs more than
ever." Studentshave gained the
power of numbers. and that,
Wray said, is the key to political
leverage. El

Campus crime rate at virtual standstill since ’83

By Bob Hanlon
STAFF WRITER
The incidence of crime at the University
in 1984 remained virtually unchanged
from 1983 In most categories, according to
Public Safety Director James] Williams.
Williams estimated that 95 percent of
the crime occurred on the uptown campus,

with the remainer divided between Alumni '

Quad and Draper Hall downtown. He ex-
plained that since a majority of students
live uptown, the high figure of uptoer
crime should not be surprising.

Crimes'are listed by' Public Safety in '

three major classifications: crimes against
property, crimes against persons, and
“other” crimes. ' '

The most prevalent crime on campus
under the crimes against property
classification was petlt larceny, which is
“anything stolen whose value is less than
$250," Williams said. There were 3|I pctit
Iarccnles last year. as compared to 313 in
I983. He explained that most of these were
book thefts from the library or a dorm
room. Williams said that many of these are
recovered because “the bookstore Is very,
very good about checking if student's
status" when selling a book, and is often
able to trace a stolen book back to the
seller. .

Another major aspect, Qlel'optIIIY,Cl'lm°

? g is criminal mischief pr wiggling pmliich

there were 236 incidents in I984. There
were 235 vandalism incidents in I983, ac-
cording to Willams. _

I984 did witness increases in some areas
of property crime. one ofthe largest in-
creases came in the area of grand larceny.
which rose from 79 incidents in I983 to “9
last year said Williams. He explained that
a grand larceny ‘— anything valued over
$250 — was most often the theft of a
purse. Williams said that “therewas a bit
of a rash (of grand Iarccnics) in the
library" last year. “At anytime,‘a purse
will be stolen or unattended", in the
University Library, adding that the term
“grand larceny" automatically applies in
the case of 'a stolen credit card. ‘

Burglary Incidents on campus are alarm-
Ing. said Williams, because a burglary
represents a “potential death." He ex-
plained that a homicide could occur.
should a student awaken and struggle with
a burglar In his or her room. There were
I06 burglaries In I983, compared to 126 In
I984.

“Most of these burglaries could have
been avoided,” he said, if students would
lock their suite and room doors. He added
that a burglar could go through a dorm on
any given night, and findiseveral doors
unlocked. “We were having a problem

with theft! at Alymnl." hcsald, because,
students maid not. lock , meirxdoou. .He .

added that several weeks after these in-
cidents, Public Safety officers returned to
Alumni one night and found several doors
left unlocked.

Williams asserted that he favors doors
that lock automatically upon leaving. and
estimated that there would be a “fifty per-

cent reduction" ill burglaries with this type r
of door. "If we could keep the doors lock- ,,

ed, it would deter thieves," he added.

In the area of crimes against persons
there was a slight increase in ‘two
categories. according to Williams; ag-
gravated harassment and public lewdness.
The ﬁrst increased from 3i incidents in
I983 to 38_In I984. Public iewdness in-
creased from 5 reports in I983 to IS last;
year he reported.

Most of the reported aggravated
harassments, Williams said, were obscene
phone calls or letters. “Many times, the
victim in these cases knows the caller.
However. rarely do people persist" in
these calls. he added. He said that anyone
receiving persistent obscene phone calls is
advised by Public Safety to not listen.
change their phone number, and have the
call traced.

In incidences of public lcwdness.
Williams said that most reports were of a
man exposing himself to a female jogger.
Heudded that the womanvwill usually

. ,report the incident too, late to capture the

culprit.

Harassment saw a relative decline from
I983 to I984. There were 30 reported in-
cidcnls in I983, and 27 such incidents in
1984. “Many of these ae )utgrowths of
people being drunk,“ Williams said.

The third classification of “other”
crimes included such categories as false

reports (58 in I983. 59 'in 198.4), driving

while intoxicated (16 in I983, 22 in I984),
disorderly conduct (to in I983, 8 in I984),
and criminal trespass (IO in I983, 13 in
1984).

However, “very little" oftheir work “is
associated with crime," said Williams.
Public Safety serves as “peace keepers”
and "helpers" In a variety of ways. He
said that 80 percent of the work of the 25
member force consists of helping out in ac-
cidents. or giving directions, or receiving
calls from “frantic parents" who are wor-
ried about their children.

Williams said that Public Safety enjoys
“solid citizen support" front the students,
adding that 75 percent of the students have
never been involved with Public Safety of-
ficers. He said. though, that some students
“feel they have been harassed.”

He said that studies show that, for every
crime reported, about ten go unreported.
“All of the serious crimes are reported.
because there, are usually a lot of
witnessesl'. . ..  .. .  ["1
