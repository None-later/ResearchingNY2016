“l've got the best of two
worlds," said Tom Whitely,

referring to his two occupations
—— defensive tackle coach for the
Albany State football team and
weekend comic for Fantasies.

He was resting his 5'4", 150
pound frame on a seat in the back
of the football office, sporting a
purple T-shirt primed with “The
Dog Pound” —— a nickname for
the Great Dane defensive line.

Judging by appearance, one
might find it hard to believe that

the diminutive Tom Whitely is
the master of that select group of

‘ behemoths. “He definitely looks
more like a comedian than a
defensive tackle coach." says one
Albany State assistant football
coach.

Whitely’s small physical frame.
his unruly curly locks, and his
jovial nature perhaps docs suit
him better for the live stage,
which is exactly the place he can
be found on Friday and Saturday
nights.

it is the off-season for the Dane
football team. it is never off-
season for Whitely. Monday
through Friday is spent traveling
througlit the state searching for
recruitable football players for
the Albany State football pro-
gram. 0n weekend nights, White:
ly can be found searching for
laughs from his audience at Fan-
tasies comedy room, "Giggles."

“At first l was a little worried
that his comedy might take his
mind off football," reflected
head-coach Bob Ford. “but it
hasn't at all. He has kept the two
things separate.”

Football was always most im-
portant for Whitely while grow-
ing up in Stafford Springs, Con-
necticut. He played defensive
back for his high school team. but
when he enrolled at Central Con-

necticut College. his size forced
him to quit the game as a player
and try coaching. He volunteered
as the junior varsity coach and
defensive backﬁeld coach for the
varsity.

His interest in comedy also
took its roots in college. “I was
never really a class clown in grade
school," said the 29-year-old
coach-comic. "i always had a
good sense of humor, but i kept it
within my friends. The whole
thing kind of snowballed in
college."

it started in dorm rooms with
Whitely telling jokes to no more
than a dozen people. His au-
dience grew at off-campus par-
ties. it wasn’t too much later
when his friends constructed a
stage for Whitely to perform his
comedy routine. “There‘d be
over 100 people at a party."
remembers Whitely. with a wide
grin.

Not bad experience for so-
meone who still didn't take it
seriously. “it's something that
just happened. it was just a fun
thing. it was a great social
activity."

Upon graduation from Central
Connecticut. Whitely’s coaching
and comedy career continued to
make gains. The new setting was
Albany State.

Albany's Athletic Director, Dr.
Willian Moore. had held the same
position at Central Connecticut
during Whitely's college years
and the two got to know each
other well. When Moore came to
Albany State. he brought Whitely
with him. and he started coaching
the defensive tackles for the
Danes in l981.

Aware of his comedic ex~
periences, Ford asked Whitely to
host the I982 annual football
banquet in the Patroon Room.
From there, a legacy started. “1
tore people apart that night."

“My humor is deﬁnitely off the wall. ”

recalled Whitely, who is now a
mainstay at the annual bash. “i
cut into everyone. it surprised a
lot of people."

Whitely's next break came in
April of l983 when Tom Jacobs.
a star offensive lineman who was
working as a bouncer at Fantasies
discotheque heard there was an
opening and urged Whitely to
audition on “Amateur Night" at
“Giggles.” “I didn’t know if i
was going to do it," said Whitely.
“Then i said, Oh. what the
fuck.”

With a large portion of the
football team in the audience,
Whitely delivered a stirring per'-
formance, so impressive. he was
hired after the show for weekend
nights. He will be celebrating his
two-year anniversary at “Gig-
gles” in three months. “i still en-
joy it,"'says Whitely. “i don't

 

feel it’s a job . l just have a job
obligation because i have to be
there."

Whitely usually arrives at Fan-
tasies at llp.m., 30 minutes
before showtime. He never
carouses at the discotheque: he
heads straight to the comedy
room. where he hangs out with
the other comedians. “i never
drink on nights 1 perform,” says
Whitely, whose showtimes are
“:30 and lp.m. “i need total
concentration up there. i need a
clear head.”

Compared often to the zany
Robin Williams for his on-stage
demeanor, Whitley likesto strut
around on stage. “i get a good
workout." he said. “l’m always
moving around. it's good because
l'm hyper anyway."

To keep his show f resh. White-
ly says he adds a new bit each

"Sometimes 1’“ try
something new and if it doesn‘t
go over, 1’“ twist it around a little
the next week and it does work."

With the pressures of coaching
for the Danes, Whitely ﬁnds little
time during the season to sit down
and think of material for his
show. He invents most of his bits
while jogging. “if l'm in the
mood, l'll sit down." says White-

Whitely has some favorite bits
that he sporadically puts'back in-
to the show. Fans often remember
“The Virgin Detector." which "is
a gadget he brings on stage to zero
in on the virgins in the crowd. The
bit has embarrassed quite'a few
women in its heyday.

“My show is all in good fun."
says Whitely. “My humor is
definitely off the wall. 1 can't
please everyone.”

Whitely is often touted for his
impersonations such as his
ﬂawless rendition: - 9f. .. Richard
Simmons and Captain Kangaroo.
He also does countless parodies
of television commercials.

This summer. Whitely plans on
living on Long island and hopes
to play clubs in Stony Brook and
Levittown. But . Whitely isn’t
forecasting any more than that:
“l’ll see how far the comedy takes
me,” he says. “i love coaching
football. 1'" just see where they
both take me.” El

the students to drink. (The) Administra~
tion believes that an academic environ-
ment should not support alcohol.“

For this reason, according to Abelow,
the Rat has, developed a designated driver

Abelow and Holzberg agreed that their
main interest in Save‘the Rat Night was a
concern for students and keeping the Rat

as a hang-out for students that live on
campus.

Senior Jeff Trynz said. “When I wasa
freshman, everybody waited on line Thurs-
day nights; that’s how i met the people i
live with now." Trynz said he felt that

that the loss of interest in the Rat is “kind

Student Action chair, Steve Oawley,
said that he hopes they run. specials every -
week. so the crowds come back. He added
that students are safer if. they drink on
campus. “i miss the atmosphere of Rat
Night.” he said.

Sophomore Glenn Giordano doesn’t
usually go to the Rat because of the bad
bands and expensive pitchers of beer. He

. said of the reduced prices tonight. “as long
. as the price is right, we will be here every

night. it's very convenient.?’

“Nobody was coming here anymore,"
said sophomore Alyssa Bergman. “so i
stopped going. i started going to bars
downtown because of a better social life."

Junior Andy Schorr stated that,

"Tonight is reminiscent of my freshman
year at Albany. you couldn't walk, you
had to yell to be heard." He added that the
school should try to have events at the Rat.
x‘The best way to keep it open would be
:‘or UAS to encourage campus organiza-
tions to hold events here." He also pointed
out that the little bar in the corner was
open. “i haven‘t seen that bar open since
freshman year.”

Cheryl Bichel, a sophomore, said the
Rat is great because it is a convenient loca-
tion for students "to gather and drink."

Michael Schonbuch summed up his per-
sonal feelings for the Rat, “if the price is

, right, the Rat will survive in 1985." El

StUden‘ts preparefor'introduction of ‘W’ rule

they plan to take should be dealt
with in another way, said
freshman David Klein. “Since the

' Sara Kremer, Director of the

undergraduates worded about
I"'W’s on, their. transcripts can

"breathe easier.” She explained.
“A ‘W' is sometimes legitimate
and we respect that," adding that
it is important to understand that
a student's whole record is being
looked at.

“if you are applying to a
medical school," she said, “and
you have dropped several science-
related courses then there may be
a problem." She added that
students that abuse the system
will most likely be the ones af-
fected by it.

Sophomore Kris Mortogen said
she does not think the change is
fair. "if a student needs to drop a
class for special reasons he will
get a "W." Why have this system
if in some cases the reasons for
dropping were valid? People who
have to drop a class because they

can't handle the work or don't
like it look the same on paper as
those who have a special need."
Junior Ellen Muto said she
feels that many students, especial-
ly frosh, are misadvised by their
advisors. “it may take longer

'than ten days to tell whether or

not a class is right for you." She
also said that a "W" will look
bad on your transcript and
“possibly hurt your chances for
post-university activities. "

Frosh Scott Wichnrd said. “as
long as those students who only
drop a few courses will not get af-
fected negatively, l have no pro-
blem with the change. i think this
is a good rule because those that
abuse the current system are not
being penalized now, and should
be.” D
