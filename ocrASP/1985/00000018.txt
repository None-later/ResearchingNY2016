Detecting faulty microchips has long
been an imperfect process, and although
no one‘ is certain why some chips become
contaminated, there has been considerable
research carried out worldwide to analyze
the molecular contents of microchips for
answers to the puzzle. . . -

Through a 'cooperative'venture between
the University and General Electric. one of
the most thorough tools used to analyze
microchipsI the microbeam analyzer. has
been developed on the SUNYA campus.

This microbeam analyzer is one of the
most accurate in the world, according to
nuclear accelerator engineer Art Habetl.

“The size of the beam,” said Haber],
“is less than one micron. ,Most other
analyzers exceed ten microns.

The nuclear accelerator is used by the
microbeam analyzer to push charged par-
ticles, about the size of the nuclear of ‘an
atom, to high speed, said Haberl. ‘

One of the techniques employed uses a
beam of particles to hit the microchip.
When the particles bounce off of the
microchip, the microbeam analyzer is used
to see what the particles have hit. By
measuring the speed of the beam, scientist
can measure what is in the microchips,
such as contaminants or heavy metals.

Additionally, using conventional scann-
ing electron microscope techniques, the
microbeamanalyze'r provides researchers
with a picture of the chip they are
sampling. ' .'

Microchips are used in virtually all of to-
day’s electronic equipment. One chip can
store‘more than 64,000 bits of informa-
tion. According to chief researcher of the

project, Dr. William Morris, the
microbeam analer —-- also called a
microprobe — “will also help researchers
design .even smaller, faster and more
reliable chips." Morris, a GE manager,

said the device could lead toadvances’in .

computerized artiﬁcial intelligence and
robotics. ‘

Before the development of this very ac-
curate microprobe, it was difficult to
determine faulty chips. Such chips were
simply discarded. The microprobe now
makes it possible to analyze composition
and structure of the chip, helping to spo

damaged chips. . '

The presence of the microbeam.
analyzer, according to University:
spoksperson Mary Fiess, is “likely to make
the University a center for ‘cutting edge"
research into the technology of microelec- »

tric chips.”
Because of the proximity of SUNYA to

General Electric, GE and University- ,4

researchers have developed a good rapport

through other joint projects. Consequent- '
ly, GE decided to begin building the ‘

microbeam here, Morris explained.
“We started out just wanting to have a

microbeam facility nearby," said Morris, .

"and we ended up with one of the best in
the world. It works better than we an-
ticipated. Better than anyone else has
achieved." ‘

As quoted in University News,
Hassaram Bakhru, director of the nuclear

accelerator lab said, “the microbeam was 

really the right thing for the University and
GE." Bakhru said, “it is the best approach
for the next 10 years and will be used in a
number of important projects by industry
and University researchers." '

 new constitution is' in .’the
works for students :living in
“,Four Plus Two,”, “an alter:
native'form of dorm life,’f atop
indian Quad Tower, whose
members are expected to take an
active role in, community and
University life.

According to 4 plus 2 President
Ross Abelow, the group was
originally founded by hippies in
the early 1970's. The hippies may
have died out, but 4 plus 2, the
group they established, remained.

Annette Perot, treasure of 4
plus 2, said, “it's just a place
yvhere you can live. Alt’s a place

“It’s a place where you can

grow. ’

,Abeloy waid that in 4 plus .2,
people know each other. Sarisky
added. “T‘plus 2 is a really good
idea. People can open up to one
another." . .
’ The 4 plus 2 constitution had to
be rewritten because there were
“no concrete ideas" stated as to
what was expected from its
members, said Perot, adding the
constitution was “very loose."

4 plus 2's original constitution
was based on the four C’s:
Cooperation, Communication,
Concern and Community, as well

longer, said Perot. Residentiallife
was not happy with the original
constitution, because it had things
in it that were actually against
University policy.

People thought that 4 plus _2

and “we wanted to change that
attitude by...doing something to
help others and be active."

“The new constitution is

' dorm director. It must be approv-

ed by her and residential life,"
said Perot, before it is voted on
by the 4 plus 2 membership. [3

Respect. "Each ‘term was defin-
ed," said Perot. “but it was too
vague" in the old constitutuion.

where you can grow, be active,
and have a more relaxed
atmosphere.” ;

Chris Sarisky, Vice President
of 4 plus 2. said, “it promotes a
more friendly environment." All

members want to help‘thle school
community as well as each other. '
he explained.

4 plus 2 is like other dorm sec,
tions in that students can be plac-
ed there by the University as
freshmen and transfers if there is
an opening. However, said Perot,
those who want to live there a se-
cond year must go through a
selection process with the RA’s
and students.

In 4 plus 2 members initiate ac-
tivities such as parties, and active-
ly take part in those activities,
said Perot. There are weekly
dorm meetings run by a different
member each week. “Each
member takes the responsibility
so no one member is in chaise."
said Perot.

The entire document was

redone. and 4 plus 2's goals were _
. better defined,taid Sarisky. cer-

\tnin things in the constitution
were oriented toward the 1970‘s,
a time that was politically
directed. The revised constitution
is cemmunlty oriented. 1 I ‘

The updated constitution was
'written by the students. “it’s

‘ what a democracy is supposed to

be. It's by the people for the peo-
ple,” said Per t. .,
Associate V ce President of
Residential Life John Martone
stated, “4 plus 2 had lost a lot of
its enthusiasm and involvement."
4 plus 2 members wanted to be
ore involved with campus and
R. ‘dentlai life, Perot said, ad-

ding 4 plus 2 (has) "done a lot. l

more ‘Iis year than it did last
year," . 'd people are also very

helpful. “’l‘eeth didn't have to be I

pulled." Pe. it said.
Some peopi were nervous that
4 plus 2 might not exist for much
