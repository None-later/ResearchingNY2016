(“traumainnermost:

call themselves liberal on public policy issues. the
results of an'annual survey released this wee

indicate.

1 The survey of college freshmen attitudes. con-
ducted jointly by the University of California at Los
Angeles and the American Council on Education,’
shows that the college class of '89 is more
materialistic than any of the classes qutioned in f

the survey‘s 19-year history.

71 percent of the 271,000 freshmen polled said
being well-off ﬁnancially is an important goal in
‘ life. Wealth is now the second most important per:
sonal value. topped onlyby students’ desire to
become authorities in their ﬁelds of interest.
Though survey director and UCLA professor
Alexander Astin said that economic conservatives
tend to be political conservatives, the survey also
found the number of students calling themselves
liberal increased for the third consecutive year.
What’s more. students took predominantly
liberal positions on public policy issues. Nearly two-
v thirds of them. for example. believe the federal.
government is not doing enopugh to promote

disarmament.

realestate agents in an attempt to
locate other areas of Albany
which might have existing hous-
ing sﬁitable for students. Also in
the works. said O'Leary. are
plans to build a new garden apart-
ment complex. which would be
used as a dormitory and would
house about 400 students. which

is approximately the some

number as would be displaced by
the enforcement of the grouper
law.

In addition. O'Leary said he
anticipates working closely with
the mayor in solving the off-
campus housing problem over the
next few years. Speaking of

knows the. University. is a-very im-_
portant resource in this'communl-

realizes Albany “has a housing

and answer questions. .
Later in the week. STOP is
planning a Bar Night with the
help of local taverns. and a Movie
Night, but details are still being
arranged. Fuchs said. .
Across the state. STOP is
enlisting the support of nationally
known celebrities from tire fields

"Students zero in on particular issues and don’t
tend to_try to adopt a monolithic political stance on
everything." Astin said.

The materialism is most evident in the students’ '

’ career choices. More than 22 percent say they are

aiming for business careers. up from 20 percent in
1983 and 12 percent in I966. the first year the
survey was conducted.

"‘We've looked at ﬁgures back over 100 years
and there's never been a phenomenon like this."

‘ Astin said. “You have to wonder how many ,

since.

(Whalen) solve it.’f Both men. ac-
cording to-O’Leary, realize “that
it took us 20 'years to develop the
problem, and it will take several
years to solve it."

Commenting on the recent
report of the independent Com-
mission on the Future of the State
University O'Leary stated that he
was very pleased with the report.
and agreed with it fully. The key
element. said O'Leary. is SUNY
deregulation so that the Universi-
ty can be more responsive to par-
ticular concerns; Right .now.
stated O'Leary, the University is
plagued by an “inability to
respond." -

. l - ‘
n.Any— request. according to
O'Leary. takes four to six months
to respond to. and during this
time many chances for research,
joint projects. or the acquisition
of equipment are lost. "State

to be held at Shea Stadium
sometime this summer.

Fuchs said there was little hope
for a quick solution to the Ethio-
pian tragedy. "it's not only an
economic problem. it's a political
problem." she said.

Cuomo said she started the
group because “i thought that the
students should be getting involv-
ed in some way." _ -

ple to help out. and to call hichs .

students are going to be facing unemployment."
The r percentage of students calling themselves
liberal reached 22.l percent. compared to the 20.5
percent adopting the conservative label. .
Conservatives outnumbered. liberals in 198i. but
the liberal label has been making a comeback ever

“People were running scared of that label."
Astin said. "Not anymore;"

interest in political affairs increased slightly last
year to 37 percent. up from 35 percent in 1983. the
all-time low for the survey. '

Astin attributed the increase to the presidential
election. “We expected it to show a blip like that."
he said. "I'd be surprised if it’s a trend." - Cl

policies concerning this issue will
probably be easyla—cliange.” said
O'Leary, “as there is universal
agreement concerning the necessi-
ty for change in this area." He
added. “I would like to see
something done in this legislative
session." but admitted that any
changes may take longer than a
few months to enact.

O’Leary also discussed the
Yugoslavian justice system as
compared to the United States’.
as well as the recent proposals by
the State Committee on Sentenc-
ing Guidelines. which included a
recommendation that New York
State establish fixed prison terms
for felons and abolish parole for
selected offenses. O'Leary. a
member of the panel which drew
up the recommendations. is a na-
tionally noted criminal justice
scholar. Cl

Financial aid
<Front Page
$33,000 would not.

Tom Calagni. Press Secretary
to Stafford; said that due to
ﬁnancial aid cuts in 198], the
government has saved $4 billion
and $1.525 billion dollars will
already be saved in I986 without
additional cuts.

All efforts since 1981 to cut
financial aid have been unsuc‘
cessful. Calagni said. because it is
the only program that provides
assistance ’to middle income
families.

indicating the importance of

student awareness and involve-‘
ment. Bowman said, “I want to'
make students aware —- students'
don't know it's going to affect

them until it's done —- until it's
