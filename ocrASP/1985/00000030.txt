common genetic disorder known
as Hereditary Hemocromatosis
(HH). r

HH is characterized by the
slow, and sometimes lethal ﬁlling
of the vital organs of between
600.000 to l.2 million Americans
with excess iron.

HH is the excessive iron abu
sot'ption of the H gene, said Krik-
ker, and individuals with this
disorder have inherited two ab-
normal H genesI she'said, one
from each parent.

These individuals absorb excess
amounts of dietary iron above
their needs, from infancy on.
Krikker said. and since the body

has no way of discharging the ex—
eess iron except by blood loss, the
iron slowly accumulates in vital
organs and joints.

It takes decades for the iron to
accumulate and produce organ
damage. explained Krikker, thus
symptoms are delayed in men un-
til their 30’s or later. Symptoms
appear etfen later because of their
periodic blood loss during

. menstruation. she said.

“Prevention r is better than
treatment" said Krikker a self-
proclaimed activist, “attempting
to prevent the nation's food supp«

. ly from having excess iron."

“It (HH) can be fatal if un-
diagnosed." said Krikker. adding
that “once the problem develops
the financial costs are
tremendous."

Early diagnosis prevents later
complications that may surface.

Krikker said.1such as‘arthritis,»

diabetes, answer and heart pro-

blems. but. she ‘cautionsnot all .
patients with these problems have ‘

HH, however. .

Treatment is simple explained
Krikker. By removing 1 pint of
blood periodically, 'possibly
through blood donation, the bone
marrow is stimulated to‘make

more blood from the excess iron; *
and so the excess iron is gradually '

removed from the organs.

Once excess iron has been
removed. blood lettings are done
only three to four times a year for
life so as to prevent a reaccmula-
tion of iron. ‘ - '

Krikker said that the blood of
HH patients is “absolutely nor-
mal” and added that "provided
patients aren’t on medieaion. the
American Red Cross can use that
blood for transfusing patients."

Zimmerman made the proposal
in a recent paper presented, to the
American Political Science
Association 'as a possible way .to.
curb inefficiency in solving urban‘
and rural problems.’ '

“If the state constitution is a-
mended to provide for the elec-

Senate by a statewideconstituen-
cy. it is possible that the Governor
would have allies in the legislative

Legislative Leaders are the
leaders of their houses, and are
currently elected by the member-
ship of the houses. and are thus
the spokespersons for the majori~
ty party. -
‘ He reasons that problems occur
because. "the individual state

support regional and statewide
solutions," and therefore "there
is a relative lack of political pay!

Leader of each house is elected by

tions. and~or Obvious reasons is a

“The Leader's prime respon-

, sibility is to determine, along with

the majority party members, what

.proposals should be given piority
as ‘party bills', and to see that

these ‘ are moved expeditiously

, through the legislative process,"

added Alexander. .
, When asked what he thought
the Leaders and Governor would

‘think of his proposal, Zimmer-

man said, “I don't know how
they would react to this. i haven’t
talked to those people, but they
probably wouldn't. be too

in commenting on the proposal

Director-of Communications for
the Senate, called Zimmerman,
“politically naive", said the pro-

‘ posal, “shows a complete lack of

understanding of the legislative
process."

vAlexander, speaking for

Speaker Stanley Fink, said "it is ‘ ‘

unfortunate but true that the

'general electorate is frequently

unaware of the names of each‘of

their representatives, much less,

the leadership qualities, or-laek

thereof of other members of .the '

house, and is hardly in a position

to vote intelligently on choices for
