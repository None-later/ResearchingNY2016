One million graduate
No one knows who. but one of the
55.000 Spring graduates from the 64 cam-
pus SUNY system Will be the millionth
student to graduate from 'the ‘SUNY
system. 1
According to Knickerbocker News.
SUNY. the nation's largest university
system, will celebrate this event

. throughout the year treating the entire

class of 1985 as the symbolic record
breaker.

A number of SUNY students, faculty
and administrators have already begun the
celebration, according to the ‘Knicker-
bockcr News, by displaying bumper
stickers stating “A SUNY Grad is one in a
million."

The celebration was officially launched
Thursday night with an alumni reception
in New York City. Individual campuses
will honor their alumni at‘various occa-
sions throughout the year. said the
Knickerbocker News.

Students deficient

0f the L900 University of North
Carolina students who took a geography
tcst. more than 90 percent failed. Some
students estimated the state's population
to be 25,000 to 250 million while others
replied that “the state of Atlanta" is on
their southern border.

“Fewer than half of the I.875 students
knew that Alaska and Texas are our two
largest states. and only about. one in every

ﬁve knew that Rhode Island and Delaware ,

are the smallest." said Richard J. Kopec.
chair of the geography department at the
UNC-Chapel Hill.

A similar test designed by The New
York Times was administered 35 years
ago. At the time. the paper called the
results “appalling.” Kopee said today’s
students’ results were significantly worse
than the students from I950,“

' - ‘iThis‘eitar'n‘was grief.

  

   

“of exp V
embarrass North Curohnians or to indict

our educational systems, but to_ link our, .
state 'with the nationwide deficiency in"

geographic training."r Kopec said: : ff

Minority scores rise

According to new figures from‘the Col-

lege Board, black high school Students?)
Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) scores are

increasing faster‘than whites‘. yet continue
'to remain below the national average. ,V .
' Blacks‘ mean verbal score .for. the
l983-84 school year was $42. This- ‘is 84
points below the national mean of 426, but
a three point increase frpm last year's
results. The mean math scores of’biack
students went up four poinls'to 373.Vnearly
one hundred points below. the" national
math mean of47l. . -  .

“Basically what We see is one of the
ironies of American educatioanherevis
improvement by minorities on standardiz-

ed tests. but the number of minorities go- 1

ing on to higher education is going down."
stated Reginald ‘Wilson, _ head of the

American Council on Lducation's Office >

of Minority Education. , _
Stomplistics prevail

The winners of last Friday’s Telethon
sponsored Rock -n- Roll Warfare were The
Stomplistics. said Nathaniel Charney,
Telethon Talent Co-Chuir. As the winners
of the six band competition, The
Stomplistics won a double sided single
contract with Blotto records, Chamey said
the single will be debuted at Telethon '85.

“it (Rock -n- Roll Warfare) was an
unbelievable success," said Charney.-ad-

ding that the event brought in about $3300 -

“which will go directly to the charities."
He estimated "about 700 students attend-
ed the event ,in , the Campus Center
ballroom. The Swing Set and Thé' Works
were judged second and “third.
respectively. ' ,. .-
