Student Community Commit-
tee chair Rich Dalton asserted.
“It‘s ridiculous for students to get
back for a paperback the same
amount they originally paid for
the tax."

SA will be meeting with Barnes
and Noble this week Gawley said.
adding “We’re going to demand
some'explanation of the whole
buy back procedure.”
said. “We'd like a complete and‘
fully delineated explanation of
the procedures and caveats of
them displayed near the buy-back
line to eliminate con fusion."

“Since students are not
satisfied with the buy back
system. we‘re looking into alter-
natives," said Gawlcy.

“Things can be done to im-
prove the systcm.” said Dalton,
adding that in 1979 students stag-
ed a sit—in and got prices lowered
and extensions on the book return
period.

One of the alternatives cited by
Gawley includes setting up a
“book barter market.”

Campbell expressed doubts
about the success of such a
market. “One of the reasons it
might not be too successful is that
many students sell back their
books at the end of the semester
because they want the cash to get
home or for the holidays. An
awful lot of people like to have
the money in hand. The wait from
May to September to sell back
books is a long time for some
people."

<Front Page

Cinemas might be persuaded to
show the half-hour movie Killing
Us Softly along with it. Killing Us
Softly is a film about the per-
nography industry.” said
Dornbaum. -

Final plans to show Killing Us
Softly would depend on financing
and the availability of the movie.
Fccrlck said. The film deals with
director Brian DePalma's treat-
ment of women.

CAP leaders said that they also
want pornography out of the
campus bookstore. “I really
don't think there should be porn
at the school. Those who want it

 

should have to go off-campus."

He also .

Bookstore surveys

Gawley said that a book barter
market has worked well at
Buffalo; '

Other alternatives. according to
Dalton. are a used-book store.
possibly another sit-in' and the im-
provement of the SA Used Book
Board. .

Lynn Jacobs. a transfer from
Southwest Missouri State Univer-
sity. said that the market “sounds
good.“ She explained. “at
Missouri there was an .anncx to
the bookstore where you ,could
buy used books ‘and sell them
back at T5 percent of the original
price.”

James Eriven. a senior, sgid “I
think a book market would be
pretty cool. I think it would work
and students would use it."

Gawlcy pointed out that
although Barnes and Noble is a
monopoly on campus students
have an advantage that other
customers dealing with
monopolies don't have. “We’re
the boss." he stated. “Students
have a majority on the University
Auxiliary Services Board of
Directors. This gives us the
leverage and say to correct abuses
if they are going on."

Gawley cautioned that
although Barnes and Noble's con-
tract runs out in May of I986. the
goal of the investigaiton is not to
get rid of Barnes and Noble but
“to remedy and fix some of the
problems and to address student
concerns in a way that Is mutually
beneficial to the students and
Barnes and Noble."

Pornography rally

said protester Sharon Cooper.

Sophomore Gino Visco staged
a one-man counter-
dcmonstration on-Friday night by
taping a picture of a naked
woman on his chest and then
throwing open his cent while he
was standing In front of the
demonstrators.

“What I hear is it (CAP) Is the
feminist group and the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance. I'm not sure
though." he said. In fact. neither
GALA nor Feminist Alliance
were official sponsor: of the
demonstration.

"I just had the feeling that this
group against pornography was
just taking this thing a little to
far." Visco added. CI
