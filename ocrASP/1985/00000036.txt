as Albany had hoped, ,with Sheldon and ,
Averill literally destroying their op-
ponents. The two Ithaca wrestlers were
transported to the hopital following their
matches.With 2:19 remaining in the first
period, Sheldon. executing a legal move.
lifted lthaca's Bob Panurrello, hipped into
him and drove him down. Panarrello, fail-
ing in his attempt to stop the move. then
stuck his arm outI and his own weight.
combined with that of Sheldon, resulted in
a separated shoulder for the Ithaca senior.

“I feel very bad about that," said
Sheldon. “He's a great guy, I've known
him for a long time."

Averill's opponent. Glen Cogswell-
ranked second nationally, lasted longer; it
wasn't until the second period with 1:06 re-
maining that Cogswell's elbow popped out
of its socket. a result of trying to stop
“The Averill."

“There's no way to stop that move."
said Averill. “If you try, either your ribs
break or your arms pop."

Coach Joe DeMco was not at all pleased
with the injuries inﬂicted upon the
opponents.

“I wanted to win, but not this way,"
said DeMeo. “I have a lot of respect for
both of those guys. It's not just a disap-
pointment, it’s a tragedy."

Ithaca had its revenge in winning the
next two weight classes, in part due to the
fact that Jim Fox was recovering from the
pulled neck muscle he had received in the
State Championships earlier this season. It
was the first time Fox. 11:11de seventh na-
tionally amongst 142 pound Division III
wrestlers, had wrestled since obtaining the
injury.

The Danes rebounded with Jerry Clark
in the 150 pound weight class. With 2:19
remaining in the first pct rod, Clark pinned
Ithaca‘s Chip Ledyard.

“That‘s my period.“ said Clark of the
victory. 'ﬁ‘l score most of my points in the
first period.” .

Seras, wrestling at 158 pounds, defeated
Larry Iacovelli, 16-6, to raise the Danes'
score to 22 points. At this point. Ithaca
trailed Albany by 14. ‘

But once again. Ithaca came back in full
force. Albany’s Marty Pidel lost a close
match to Steve Hite. 7-4 at 167 pounds.

At 177 pounds and 190. the Danes were

‘ SPORTS BRIEFS

Women swimmers

When facing a team like Cortland,
which is one of the top-rated schools in
Division I'll in the state. the Albany
' State women swimmers weren't expec-
ting to win. which they didn't. They
. were hoping for some personal bests and
';.tt few more women to qualify for the

States, which they did.

“It was more important for people to
qualify," said Assistant Coach Carolyn
Shadock.

Thus far eleven swimmers have
qualiﬁed. Jennifer Morrow joined them
on Saturday as she qualiﬁed for the
States in the ZOO-meter breaststroke with
a time of 2:54.

Chris Monahan swam a personal best I
of 11:09 in the loo-yard breaststroke.

“We were missing threc swimmers
which is why we were kind of weak."
said swimmer Carol Pearl.

Pearl broke two records at Cortland.
In the woo-meter freestyle. she swam a
11:35 chopping‘seven seconds off of
Nancy Smith's record. The loo-meter
freestyle was also broken by Pearl. who
swam a 5:36 to shave only a second or so
off of her own record.

Roy Eisehhot at 177.

Unfortunately for the Danes. both lost
their decisions,
heavyweight match the Danes led by only
two points. The situation Faughnan had
feared earlier was a reality; _

Faughnan was again faced ‘wlth a taller,
heavier opponent. and his 4-2.1035 to Rich
Kane was not decided until the end of the
ﬁnal period. But the loss did give Ithaca
the ﬁnal edge. as they took the overall vic-
tory. 23~22.

“They did a great job out there today,"
said DeMeo of his team. “No one per-
formed poorly; everyone was within a few
percentage points of his ability. Maybe we
could point to a few guys who could have
done better, but you can always do that.
Instead. we’ll remember Shawn’s. David’s

and Jerry's intensity and try not to lose
any more."

The Ithaca match was not without its
positive aspects. Sheldon, Seras and
Averill, in winning their matches.-remain
undefeated this season. increasing their
win streaks to 18-0. Averill‘s win tied him
with Vic Herman,(’83). for the Univervsity
record for career wins with 63, ,(Seras trails

Richburg is third

Diana Richburg, an Albany State
Junior. placed third in the 880-de run
at the Dallas Times-Herald Invitational
Track meet Saturday night in Reunion
Arena.

Richburg, a Lansingburgh native, was
holding second with a half lap to go
when Romania's Sita Lovin clbowed
her. Lovin passed Richburg and wound
up second for the race.

“That really threw me off stride.”
said Richburg via telephone after the

race.

The Albany State Junior. who was
suffering from a chest cold, broke out in
front at the start and remained in ﬁrst
until Donna Melinte, the eventual win-
ner. passed her midway through the
race.

“That was part of my strategy, to get
the lead and try and control it the best
that I can." said Richburg. “I hesitated.
though."

Next week. the Albany State student
will travel to Los Angeles for the LA.
Times Invitational Meet on Friday.
Richburg will then ﬂy to the Eastern
coast for Saturday Olympic Invitation
at the Mendowlands in New Jersey.
