CONTINUED FROM PACE 3A.

Wakeling and Ranking Roger of the im-
-mortal English Beat. General Public is go-
ing places.

Simple Minds released a new album and

singer Jim Kerr married Chrissy Hynde of .

The Pretenders. A new Simple Minds
movie soundtrack is due out in about two
weeks.

The Human League and their. counter-
part Heaven 17 each released another
dance club synlh-pop album. They could
be WCDB’s most requested bands of [984.

XTC continues to hold their position as
the most underrated band of all time. They
released two albums in '84, Mummer and
The Big Express, the latter being one of the
best of the eight albums they have made.
Playing strictly pop music with intricate
percussion and guitar work, XTC is virtual-
ly unknown in areas without college radio
to support them. They used to tour on oc-
casion, years ago, but they never will
again.

Lastly, the Style Council rounds out the
best European of 1954. Paul Weller has
formed a band totally different from his
most popular endeavor. The Jam. The
Style Council's album My Everchanging
Moods contains a diverse selection of rock,
disco, dance, pop, and jazz music. The
great piano work by Mick Talbot assured
that this album was dcfinatcly one of the
best of 1984.

l have left out countless bands on this

list, so if you are going record shopping

don't discard anything not included here as
garbage. There is plenty of great music
around to run cveryone’s wallet dry (I

should know). Before I forgot, has anyone .

ever heard of Duran Duran?

*SUNYAwill be losing 52 employees,
mostly teaching faculty, to early retire-
ment beginning with {the fall 1985
semester. The departures are attributed to
a retirement incentive bill that was signed
by Governor Cuomo last summer.

The bill provides an extra beneﬁt for
eligible members of both the Teachers’
Retirement System (TRS) and the

Teachers' Insurance and Annuity Associa- '

tion (TIAA). New York State will con-
tribute a three year service credit for eligi-
ble teachers, for example, 25 years of scr-
vicc translates into 28 years, for purposes

of formulating a pension._ > _

The legislation is considered corrective
.in nature, according to Director otj Person-
nnl Leon Calhoun. Three years agorretirc-
ment .incentives were offered to State
employees of the New York State Retire-
ment System. However, the Teachers'
Retirement System .and TIAA were left
out. Last year, incentives were offered for
_thc first time for those previously not, cligi~
bio. This year. 150- SUNYA employees
were eligible. and 52 accepted the offer.
Of the 52, 43 are involved with academic
disciplines. 41 are teaching faculty, some

Ramaley aboutthis. We have expressed a
desire to find qualiﬁed people. with an ac-
cent on minorities." Vice President 'for
Academic Affairs Judith .Ramalcy could
not be reached for comment. 2. _

Budget Officer Gene Gilchrist said that

the— early retirement losses will allow for

flexibility in recruitment. He downplayed
any- monetary considerations. "There will
be no dollarsnvings," said Gilchrist, "our
goal is greater mobility in the work force,

including an increase in junior level
positions.” ' ‘

Calhoun, however, disagreed. “The

whole point of the plan is to save money,"
said Calhoun. The 52 retiring staffers
average $44,600 in annual salary, for a
total of $2,322,297. They have l,l04 com-
bined years of experience behind them, he
added.

He emphasized that of the over two

 

 

million dollars, the state will receive a cer-
tain percentage, and coupled with the im-
probability of ﬁlling all 52 staff positions,
with persons receiving similar salaries
money will be saved. “We’ll feel the loss
of 1,000 years of experience. The question
is, can tthoss be made up by new peo-
ple,” said Calhoun. >

To qualify for early retirement beneﬁts.

' cmployes must be at least 55 years old,
have at least 22 years of experience, and

have set their retirement date for between

Students should ﬁnd it easier to
return texts to Barnes and Noble, and
get more money for the books under an
agreement worked out with the store's
management and student leaders, accor-
dlng to Student Community Committee
chair Rich Dalton.

’Dalton, speaking at Wednesday
night’s Central Council meeting, said
that the bookstore agreed to add ektra
staff to buyback lines and to provide ex-
tra days for students to receive half price
on book returns in a meeting held with
bookstore manager Murj Campbell
Wednesday.

Barnes and Noble also agreed to
scpcrnte book return and buyback lines.
to post buyback procedures. make
available a list of mark-ups on merchan-
disc with the SUNYA insignia. refund
prepriccd books that are already
ordered at 50 percent rather than the
current l0 percent, and list the ordered
propriccd books for students'
convenience.

, Student dissatisfaction was brought
,to the bookstorc's attention through

Bookstore cOnoedes policy switcﬂ

surveys. Dalton said. The poll was con-
ducted .by the Student Action and Stu-
dent Community Committees last week.

Steve Gawlcy. Student Action Com-
mittee chair, cited student activist
techniques as _on inﬂuential factor.
.“Thcrc were some real solid activist
techniques employed -— even the threat
of student activism helped us reach our
goal," he said.

anlcy added that a possible protest
aimed at the bookstore "was a major
factor in prompting the bookstore into
complying with our demands."

Dina Roman. assistant manager of
the bookstore. said that she thinks the
changes are very reasonable. “We will
do anything that we can to make it bct-
tcr for the students," Romnn suid, ad-
ding. “it was good that students did the
survey and told us the results."

"The bookstore was very responsive
to our needs." Gawley noted.

Nevertheless, on Oversight sub~
Committee will be formed, according to
Cowley, “to oversee and to ensure that
the promises of the bookstore manage-
ment arc in fact completed."
