The Business Education pro-

gram at SUNYA may soon be

closing its doors for good because
of staff losses and because it

doesn’t ﬁt into the research 'rnis- -
, sion of the, University. ad-.’

ministrators say. .
The program,~-one of the.

ducation teachers in New (York,

. was originally assigned four, pro-

fessors, but two will be retiring at
the end .of this year "and a third
died' in 1982. ’With th'c'igene'ral
shonage of resources available to
the university, SUNYA President
Vincent O'Leary suspended ad-

, missions into the undergraduate

program in 1983 and Vice Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs Judith

Ramaley initiated a task force last ‘

November to investigate the situa-
tion. The task force has not issued
a report thus far.

Although “there is a high de-
mand for business teachers in
New York State," according to
Student Association Programm-
ing Director Patty 'Salkin. the on-

ly student on the task foce, the *

program holds a lower priority
than many other education pro-
grams at SUNYA, such as math
and science. 'The low priority
status bestowed upon the pr0<
gram by the Dean of the School
of Education Robert Koff seems
to cause deﬁnite reservations

, about the chance of allocating the

resources to keep it open.
The low status stems from the

According to Thomas, STOP

‘Joe Stern of the state coor-.

have gained momentum now. —
our first move was Albany and it

. was a success, then the SUNY

system and the response was over-

' whelming, now it is not only the

private schools but the CUNY
system as well.” - -

He explained that over ten dif-
ferent schools statewide were in-
volved and the downstate area is

. next to be worked on.

Schools are not the only basis
of involvement, said former light
heavy weight champion 'Eddie

Mustafa Muhaminod. “1 am go- ,

While 'the current program ac-
cepted approximately forty
students per year before admis-
sions were suspended, the propos-
ed program will accept only about
half that amount, explained
Margaret Farrell, Chair of the
Teacher Education Department.
Many people feel that the fate
of the Business Education pro-
gram is more than a discussion of
resources. SUNY Albany is the
major supplier of Business
Education teachers in New York
State and offers a well-respected
program. Salkin said. Currently
only two other SUNY schools of-
fer a Business Education pro-
gram, and, as Salkin pointed out,
“there is a high demand for
business teachers in New York.”
in an effort to keep the pro-
gram alive, alumni, students, and
Student Association officials have
written letters to O'Leary and
Ramaley to stress their beliefs
about the importance of the pro-
gram, Salkin said. C]
