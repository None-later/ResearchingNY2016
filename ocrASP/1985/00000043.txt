The birth of African-American
History Month is credited to
Carter G. Woodson who initiated
Negro History Week February 7,
I926. Woodson‘s purpose for
establishing this week was to alert
all races, including blacks, to the
numerous con-

History Week has been extended
to African-American History
Month with the full intention of
educating all races about the
history of black people.

The importance of an in-
dividual or an entire race to know
its history extends beyond many
other concerns. In the same
respect, the needs for blacks and
whites .to understand and far-
ticulate black. history is crucial

. and mandated, in knowing black

history, the many myths concern-

ing blacks can~be dispelled.- '1: is « V

almost impossible to distinguish
fact from fiction without know-
ing what thefacts are. Just how
do we learn facts? We learn the
truth by researching history to its
extreme without being content or
pacified by what we find in
universities' bookstores.

Many believe that black history
started with slavery. Why?
Perhaps these individuals were
recipients of this knowledge from
teachers whose awareness of
black history is limited. Indeed,
history was being formulated long
before the slavery era was
initiated.

Moreover, history is a measure-
ment of race‘s progression.
Through black history. we can
trace and sight the progression of-
black people in various facets of
their lives. This measuring of pro-
motion is cssential for racial
growth and prosperity, and saves
us from a high probability of

It is essential for blacks to
know their true history so that
they can pay tribute and publicize
the achievements of past promi-
nent figures who would otherwise
have gone unrecognized. It is we
who must present our race and
the contributions thereof to socie-
ty so that truth, positivity. and

contributions can be visualized. -

In order to take pride in their
heritage in a world that often
associates negativity with the
word "black" and therefore, with
black people. ' -

Blacks need‘ to know their
history so that they cart have an

African-American History
Month does not only emphasize
the contributions made by blacks
during the progress of time. but it
reminds the black race from
where they’ve come, their current
racial status and thus, steers them
to positive directions and heights.
it reminds blacks of their pains
and past voices while celebrating
the removal of chains: mental,
physical, and spiritual. It reminds
them of the doors they had been
locked behind until their visibility
was hidden in the darkness. It
allows them to celebrate the
removal of these doors which per-
mits them to be more and more
visible to a society that had often
overlooked them.
African-American History
