searches for carefully measured answers
to probing questions, Ally Sheedy is also
a portrait of wistful vulnerability The
young girl who achieved best-seller
status as an author at age 12 with her
book .H‘be Was Nice Io Alice, grew into an
accomplished actress. best known for
her box-office smash \V(H'GNIIIL’.\', and
soon to be seen in 77.70 urea/Jar! Club,
and Twice in a [470 Time.”
She has accomplished much in her 22
years, bttt Ally still readily admits to
searching for and believing in the possi-
bility of real, lasting love.

“True, pure love can enhance your life
in every way; a free, warm, supportive
relationship is rare. but worth ﬁnding.

“1 think there is a return to old. tradi-
tional values," says the young wotnan
whose parents were divorced when she
was nine.

"1 don't think there's anything wrong

 

with getting pleasure in sex. But person-
ally, I‘m not very promiscuous—not at
all. i believe a lot of people have a two-
faced attitude that says that it's just a
function of human nature to sleep with
someone—a sort of release. Still, almost
every person i know, of both sexes, real-
ly wants to fall in love."

Firmly committed to her career and to
her ongoing malor in acting at USC, Ally
nevertheless thinks that work and love
can be compatible, if they are rooted in
a sense of self worth.

“For the, as far as a career is con-
cerned, love would not be a hindrance;
it would be helpful . . . at the same time,
i feel that the other person would have
to feel good about his own work areas
and have his own work Interests."

Whether she's concerned with work
or love, Ally functions on the basis of
being absolutely hottest with herself.

“i know that i have a little place in the
center of my gut that tells me if people
are on the level. inside, i always know. i

 

don't know where it comes from, but if i
follow that little voice it usually leads me
to the right place and makes me a little
stronger."

That‘s very imponant, considering all
the temptations she‘s around. as her
career continues to soar in Hollywood.

"You want to believe there's a Santa
Claus, that it's all true, because it's all so
enticing. A lot of people ﬂoat along, try-
ing to give life some meaning with
drugs. drink and money, But i don't
think any of those things work. It has to
come from inside. it takes a lot of work
for me to keep myself at peace, and I
often say, “Thank God, I don't buy into
the other scene.”

Ally lives alone now, in a small guest
house in the Hollywood Hills, but a
few years ago, she lived with her boy-
friend. That iong-term relationship dis-
solved when they both grew in sepa-
rate directions.

She found that moving in with him —
