Mandela rejects offer

Soweto. South Africa
(AP) Nelson Mandela. the black rights
leader who has been jailed for 21 years.
has defiantly rejected the white-ruled
regime’s conditional offer of freedom
and demanded an end to its racial
segregation policy.

Zinzi Mandela. 24. announced her
father’s response to the'of f er Sunday at
a rally attended by about 10,000 people
of all races in Soweto. the huge
segregated black township outside
Johannesburg. She said her father gave
the statement to her mother. Winnie, on
Friday when Mrs. Mandela visited him
at Pollsmoor prison near Capetown.

President Pieter W. Botha told
Parliament last month that Mandela
and others jailed with him could go free
if they renounced violence as a tool to
end apartheid. the government's legal
policy of racial seperation. -

But Mandela. who was president of
the outlawed antilapartheid African Na-
tional Congress when he was arrested.
said he could not accept freedom while
the congress remained banned and
unable to take part in the debate on the
nation's future.

MiA’s to come home

Bangkok, Thailand
(AP) The Vietnamese government will
turn over to the United States the re-
mains of five people it says are
Americans listed as missing in action in
the Vietnam War. reliable sources
disclosed Monday. .

The United States has said that
substantial progress and cooperation in
resolving the MiA issue is a condition
for establishing diplomatic relations
with Vietnam.

Vietnamese authorities who deal with
MlAs told their US. counterparts at a
quarterly meeting in Hanoi last week
that they would hand over the remains
of the Americans but they did not fix a
date.

Any remains will be flown to the
Army's Central Identification
Laboratory itt Honolulu to try to make
positive identification.

Nuke policy praised

 

 

ference at the end of an ofﬁcial visit
during which New Zealand was embroil-
ed in a row with the United States over
New Zealand’s refusal to allow U.S.
nuclear-powered or armed warships to
use its ports. ’

Asked whether he thought the policy-
which caused a near~rupture of AN-
ZUS. the defense alliance of Australia, ‘
New Zealand. and the United States-
was realistic, Perez de Cuellar said. “if
we think in terms of realistic or
unrealistic we won't move.”

Budget and staff cut

- Washington. D.C.
(AP) The Reagan administration. which
once boasted that its "junkyard dog"
inspectors general saved nearly $6
billion in a six-month period. proposes
to save a fraction of that by cutting their
budgets and staffs.

 

 

With the exception of the Defense
Department. the budget submitted by'
President Reagan last week calls for the
inspectors general in each of the major)
federal agencies to spend less in fiscal
l986 tha'n they did this year.

Canyon plant tested

San Luis Obispo, Calif.
(AP) The new Diablo Canyon nuclear
power plant produced enough electricity
for 600,000 people during weekend
testing that took its Unit l reactor to 60
percent of its capacity. a utility
spokesman said. ,

The facility. undergoing tests prior to
licensing for full operation, eventually
will generate enough electricity to serve
the needs of about 1 million people.
Rutkowski said.

On Saturday. a leak allowed steam to
escape from the turbine generator
system on the secondary. or non-
nuclear. side of the facility. and posed
no radioactive hazard. PG&E said.

Leak harms wildlife

 

 

1 Island Park. N. Y.
(AP) About 100,000 gallons of home
heating oil leaked from a Long island
Lighting Co. oil storage tank into a
marsh area on the south shore of the
island. threatening wildlife and setting
off an all-night clean-up effort. Coast
Guard ofﬁcials said.

The leak was circled with it contain-
ment boom and the tank was secured ,
around 3am. Monday. said Loren
Bulard, a Coast Gurad spokesman.
Three contractors hired by LlLCO went
to work cleaning up the oil. he said.

Coast Gurad Lt. Peter Blaisdell called
the major spill a direct threat to fish and
wildlife living in hundreds of acres of
surrounding salt marsh.

“The whole area is basically a salt
marsh. a recreation, area and a breeding
ground for birds and ﬁsh." said
Blaisdell. who is the assistant port safety
officer for the Captain of the Port of

-' Probe. unearths“ Gyro uper Law

By Jacqueline Clark
srm warren .

The City of Albany’s Code Enforcement:
Bureau has discovered l25 separate cases
of “Grouper Law" Violations in the Pine
Hills area. said active director for Code
Enforcement Mike Alvaro. . '

Canvassing daone by the bureau during
the fall has served to show “how broad of
a problem" the zoning ordinance violation
in Albany is. said Alvaro. The Bureau. he
said. now has “a substantial list of proper-
ties" in which there is‘ obviously ‘strong
evidence' of violationsiv r A

Alvaro said that he wasvnot‘ ready to
disclose specific details of the recently
compiled data. He did say. however. that
the canvassing of l.700 apartments Was
about “65 percent accurate". and that the
number of violations in the Pine'llills area
would probably be closer to 165.

With the new list. Alvaro said the

bureau was “ ready to act upon'an o.k. ,

from the mayor." This action would be
directed at landlords. said Alvaro. “most
likely" in the form of fines. “if landlords
plan to ignore our pleas for compliance.
we're going to hit them where it hurts
worst - in the pocketbook." Alvaro said it

 

was a/ question of - makin‘g landlords

“understand'the law" and obeyrit.

The ﬁnes are based on “commission of
the offense" said Alvaro. requiring a
“correction of the problem.” “Each day
after the‘ original conviction constitutes a

» separate offense". he added.n Alvarosaid.

however. that the ordinance would have to
be complied with by the new lease-date. in
respect to students living in this housing.
Alvaro said that “it is not avcondition
[that landlords] keep them.” '. . ,
"We're doing everything in our' power

- not to infringe anything on the kids.“ said

Alvaro. adding that “We have requested
they not be removed.."v“They are our
Witnesses," he explained. _

Mark Mlshler,_S.A. Attorney. said that
action by the city against students living in
violation of the Grouper Law “could be a
possibility and has been threatened.
although it hasn’t happened." Mishler
said that students do have some rights in
these cases. “if a landlord knew about the
extra people and if the extra people end up
being kicked out. they may have good
reason for a lawsuit." ' V '

,. Mlshlcr said that tenants have it right to

that ‘when’ he told them they I

live according to agreements made. "if a

landlord breeches that agreement.” said
Mishler. students should be “compensated
for damages incurred." Mishler gave mov-
ing expenses and extra rent due to loss of
one tenant as examples of damages.
Alvaro said he believed many students
“came to the city not knowing the law",
adding “it’s not their fault.” He also said
that the conviction of landlords was “out

.of the kids hands" and asked-students to

“No one is denying SUNYA students’
importance in Revenue to the City. The Ci-
ty owes a lot of thanks to the institution."
saidAlvaro. adding that the Bureau had
an “obligation to our citizens" and could
not ignore the problems in heavily student
populated areas such as overcrowding.

“Citizens are very supportive of the

' crackdown". said Alvaro. adding that the

Bureau often recleves anonymous letters
from citizens identifying‘ houses with
"Grouper Law" violations.

“We allowed it [the number of viola-
tions] to get out of hand". said Alvaro.
"it is our problem". he added. “and

 offers his personal
"perspé‘Ctives ‘ on homosexuality

along side of you?"

Rothcnberg said that when he told his family,
they didn't change their minds about him. rather
they “had to change their minds about what they
thought was gay." he said . He also said he does not
want people to accept the myth that “gays coming
out of 'the closet has weakened the American-fami-
ly." because if anything. it has made“ them
stronger." he said.

Another myth Rothenberg addressed was the
idea that gays “can tell each other on sight," which
he thought to be ridiculous. because. he said. that if
he were to tap everyone in the audience on the
shoulder whom he thought to be gay “every
' straight person would go into a panic. " Rothenberg
added that be “identiﬁed with Jackie Robinson
because. he was an outsider too."

Ottepgthe hardest things-about being a homosex-
ual. Bothenberg said. is that ‘fwe are‘alwaysbeing

th , minunity were given by homosexuals, in-
cluding'the f amous black writer. Langston Hughes,
whowasn’t known to be gay until after he died. But
usalways. he said. that person is discredited and his
“gayness explains the negative thingsthat the per-
son has done in life."

“America must reconsider their stereotypes...No
one can blackmail me." he said. explaining that it is
because 'he is upfront about his homosexuality.
“For a gay person. being honest means ceming
out.“ he added.
