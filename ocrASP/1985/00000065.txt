Helping hand ext end‘ed’tojobseekingggﬁiorg  '

By Lynn Amltrano

Seniors wondering how to
tackle the ‘real' world out there,
or looking to reinforce their job
seeking skills may find help at the
University's Career Development
Center. -‘

According to the center's new
director. Dr. Gardy Van Soest.
three speciﬁc programs are cur-
rently being offered, and more
are being planned for the future
as resources allow. ' - .

The ﬁrst of the programs of-
fered is an orientation session to
give students an idea of what the
center has to offer. Amy Ander-
son, the staff’s graduate assistant
in charge of the orientation pro-
gram said that “live help is better
than handouts, even though by
necessity mostly routine facts are
given" at the session.

“We just give a brief overview
of what the center is all about,”
added Van Soest.

About 600 students have
already been through orientation.
Van Soest said. and each was
given a file card and recommen-
dation forms in order to start a
reference file for prospective
employers or graduate schools.
The files. he said, can include
reference letters. an unofficial
copy of a student‘s transcript,and
a resume.

Generally, Van Soest said, per-
sons interested in education.
social welfare. or health care are
strongly recommended to begin
reference files, while it is less im-
portant for students looking for
careers in business or technical
fields. -

Students also learn about the

center's library, which.Van Soest

said, contains job guides, files,

and directories. and information
about the - Computerized ' .lob
Matching Service which stores
listings of available positions

from across the state and the-

country.
After orientation. a resume

writing workshop is available at *7
which the basic organization and ,

information of a
discussed, as well as cover letters.

Van Soest- said. in addition, '
students with rough drafts of .‘
their resumes can bring them to 

the workshop for critiques. sug-
gestions. and general comments.

Finally. the center offers a‘

videotape which takes viewers
through the campus interview
process. Van Soest noted that it

. was in these interviews that pro~

spective employers and graduate
schools decide who they would
like to speak with again and who
they were not particularly im-
pressed with.

“lf you know how to package
yourself and sell yourself you’re
going to be more successful," in
looking for a job. said Van Soest,
emphasizing the importance of
Job Search skills.

in an effort to make the center
more accessible to both students
and alumni, operation hours have
been expanded on Tuesday nights
to 7:00 p.m.

Van Soest also said he would
like to increase the number of
staff at the center. Currently eight
people work there. but he said
funds to hire more people may be

’ available either through increased

state support, which he admitted

would be "hard to come by." or
through revenues raised by fees
charged at the center.

The center, he said. charges
alumni for the help they receive;

as well as a $5.00 charge for each .

time the Computerizedlob Mat-

ching Service is utilized. There is

alsoa small fee for sending copies

of the reference file out. said Van‘

Soest.

Changes Van‘ Soest said ‘he
would like-to see implemented in-

utilization of 'current I job’ search .
more fros'h. and‘ .
sophomore involvement in. the,

graduate schools.

A recently‘released report by the. independent

Commission of the'Future of the State University .

of New York has concluded‘that‘ many im-
provemcnts are needed in the management of the
SUNY system to secure SUNY's place among
top-notch public universities.

The report 'Was released January 16 and
reflected a year of study by the independent
Commission on the Future of SUNY. ‘

Among the recommendations cited was the
restructuring of SUNY as a public beneﬁt cor-
poration. This would allow greater independence
from the‘ legislature and state agencies so SUNY
could manage its own affairs and ﬁnances. ”

The Commission found the SUNY system to
be “the most overregulated in the nation.” The
report alsostated. “we have explored other alter-

. natives, but believe“ that this form of authority

provides the most feasible way to .give SUNY's
Board of .* Trustees, Chancellor and state-

appointed campuses the responsibilities that the

university requires and that public universities of
other states get." ’ . -  ' ‘
Reactions from the State Legislature showed
eagerness to act on the recommendations.“ the
Committee. Assemblymembei‘ MarkAlan Siegel
(D-Manhattan), chair of the Assembly Higher

Education Committee said, “this report sheds-

lights on a long-standing problem — the threa
SUNY’s quality imposed by excessive'cont
We are very serious about finding ways to
eliminate bureaucratic obstacles that may be
preventing SUNY from being'all it can be)?

that it is too early to say whenlegisla‘tion might.
be approved Or what specific form it Would take.
The report also encourages the recruitment of
minority high school students and efforts to in-
terest undergraduate minority .students .in
graduate studies. A need to strengthen the fancy
tions of research and graduate and professional
education was also cited. ‘ 1
Both Siegel and Lavalle agreed that the SUNY
system needed more alumni to project a better
image of the system across the country.
“Academically, we have a gem," said Lavalle,
“but its lustre is not now gleaming throughout

“There existsa certain relation-
ship between employers and a
disabled employee. there are cer-
tain expectations.” said intern
Robert Pipia. who workedion up-'
dating procedural manuals for the

accounting office. “The disabled" ‘

are sometimes afraid to askfor
certain things from emplbyers."
he added.

According to'Pipia. the staff of
the accounting office demanded a
lot but were “really helpful to
making certain adaptations." A
tape recorder was loaned to Pipia
in order to aid him in keeping
track of records.

The other interns. Sandra
Lamb, and Garry Wood, were
also honored for their work.

The pilot program will be
evaluated this semester and will
continue in the fall. “We are hop-

ing to expand it to other depart--
El

ments," said Belowich.
Guidelines

sent during judicial proceedings,
said Schaffer. who said that
under current guidelines students
may have someone present to ad»
vise them. but no one may speak
on their behalf.

The guidelines for due process
have also been criticized by SA at-
torney Mark Mishler. In a
memorandum sent to the Review
committee in November. Mishler
maintained that the "University
does comply with the minimum

level of due process which" has'

been required by the,cour'ts.”
but, he added “why not provide
greater protection to ..students
than the minimum reduired by
law?!)  . .

The disciplinary guidelines
have not undergone a thorough
examination since its inception in
1967. said Pogue. The policy has
been approved yearly by the
Judicial Review Committee, but
with no comprehensive review.

“The university and students
have changed” over the years.
said Pogue, which makes it
necessary to update the policy. D

Not all 64 SUNY campuses are
sharing in these deals. said
Rogowski. “It depends on in-
dividual needs of the campus." he
explained.

Few students seem to be aware

of the offers. however. “i know;
nothing about this offer. l-‘m not
personally interested in buying a
computer. but my housemates
were thinking of going in on
one." said senior Mary Costelloe.

“I'm not interested in com—
puters. but if] were i think it is a
great opportunity to buy a com—
putcr at a cheap price," said
Aileen Hochman. also it senior. .

‘l’ve heard of this. They’ve had
this deal for a while," said David
Niner. a graduate student and
CUE adviser.

John Bogart, who lives off-
cnmpus, said. “Yes. ‘ I've been
there. I know what they have to
offer. They're avallableat really
