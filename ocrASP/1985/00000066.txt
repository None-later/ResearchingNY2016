‘The Boss’ saves Rat

New Jersey rocker Bruce Springsteen
helped save the Rat last Friday night when
the Save the Rat Committee sponsored a
“Bruce Springsteen Video Night" in the
Campus Center Rathskeller.

Committee co-chair Eric Holtzberg said
100 to 150 people attended the event.
Holtzberg said that eight kegs of beer were
sold and that “everyone had a really good
time."

He added that upcoming events to save
the Rat include a program thisThursday
sponsored with Students Opposing Pover-
ty (S.T.O.P.) where the Rat would con-
tribute a' quarter to the Ethiopian Relief
Fund for every dollar of beer purchased.
Also planned is "Frat Night at the Rat" to
be held February 2i.

“Basically we have plans for every'

Thursday night. Things are going very
well." Holtzberg stated. He added that
business at the Rat has increased by 10 per-
cent since these activities have begun.

Dirty bowls go glass

Patrons of Indian Quad’s cafeteria
found that the plastic salad bowls have
been replaced by larger glass ones over
intersession.

According to Director of Food Service
Ronald Clough. the change over was made
because the plastic bowls stained easily.
thereby appearing dirty when they were ac-
tually clean. “They were cleaned but the
dishwashing machine wouldn't get them to
look clean." he said.

Clough added that if the glass 'boivls
recieve a positive response from students.

. all cafeteria bowls would be switched over

to glass in the near future. i l
The glass bowls cost three cents. more

than the 97 cent plastic ones, a price'dif-

ference Clough described as "minimal" in

I determining thedecision. As far as the_
glass bowls beingwmore fragile. he.said..;‘-t

 

 

“We lose so many of them as it is that I
don't think breakage is involved (in mak-
ing the decision to change over to glass)."

NEA negotiations and

The California Faculty Association. a '
National Education Association (NEA) af— .

filiate that represents 19.000 faculty of the ~

State University System, came to a ten—
tative contract agreement with the board.
of trustees after almost a year of heated
negotiations.

' The agreement includes a, number of

proposals that could be a model for other .

contracts across the country. .

The proposals include more faculty in-
put on setting standards for awards and
selecting award winners. There were also
changes in promotion 'and tenure
procedures.

United University Professions. which
represents SUNY facultyI is now in the
process of negotiating its contract.

Cafeteria fern stolen

The six-and-one-half foot decorative
fern from the Campus Center Cafeteria
has been missing since last Tuesday mom-
ing. according to Lester Hynes, Director
of Cash Sales for University Auxiliary Ser-
vices (UAS).

; I. He said the plant was worth $350 and

was probably taken the night of February

' lI after the cafeteria was eluted at 4:00

pm. Hynes hopes that “someone may see
it and return it to UAS." although he said
the plant may have died in the sub-zero
weather of that night.

V V:"All of these things (thefts and van-
dalism) add up in the price of the food."

'Hynes commented. He asked that anyone

with information of the fern-napping con-
tact .UAS. . " ,

studeht’lobbyistsnnaezi rewarding 

By Pam schusterm‘an

STAFF WRITER , '_
Forty SUNYA students made:

their way down to the New York

State Capitol last; Tuesday, to

begin the first of four successive

lobbying sessions against the pro- ‘

posed raise in the drinking age to _

zi. -  _
“The possibility of the drinking
age-issue coming to the fldoiﬁ'this‘,’
term is very great.” said Steve".
Gaw éy, member’of the Student
Association of the State Universi-
ty (SASU) Board of Directors and
Student Action Committee'chair
at SUNYA. “We knocked it
down last year.’_f he explained;
but this year maybe toughen; ~» A

According to Oa’wleyfFederal «

legislation which will deny
highway project funding to states
who do not have a 21 year old
drinking age by October of 198.6.

_ is a big factor in the issue.

“This act of federal blackmail
is the basis of many misconcep-

tions pertaining to the alleged

urgency of raisingthe state’s pre-
sent legal drinking age." He ex-

plained that the legislators base ..

their judgements on the fact that
New York State stands to lose $90?

1 million in federal highway funds..

However. .Gawley and other

SASU and SA tnembers have,

gathered research support from a~

,wide variety of sources ranging ‘

from “Stop 2i” Committee of
Wisconsin,
Lieutenant Governor's Office in'
Austin. Texas. ' '

SASU’s arguments, according .'

to Gawley. are based on raw data.

' which show that the rise to a nine- ' ’
teen year old drinking age did not
- grew-uw—amm is.” ~.I 7;. ,

to the .

reduce - driving 'l fatalities among '
eighteen year olds. '

Also; ire-said. the money loSt -

from closing down liquor stores,

-.and the decrease.in-liguorgsalesf

‘ and related jobs‘ r’s'tirpass’ the
federal highwai‘; income ?‘ loss;
“This loss is a continuous loss,"
said Gawley,‘adding. “it doesn’t

“endgafter two years as does the

I highwayscuts” .1. a
j “The~ main crux afoul-Harw-
‘ment.’""i”‘saldc Gawley. V “is that

“education is the key to reducing
fatalities and that is what we are
proposing.” ' ‘

However. on the other side of
the issue. he‘ said. are the benefits
égthat'increasittg the drinking age
will reduce drinkinggan'd driving
fatalities and reduce the number
of minors .coming illegally into

New York: to purchase liquor.
“Burmese. statements are often

‘ based on one sided data.” Gawley

*said. , r ,_ \

"Raising the drinkingage is an
easy 'solution'to a difﬁcult pro-
blem." said Gawley. If the drink"-
ing age is raised. he said. the
legislature will feel as if they've

,- done something against the pro-

'hlem. but. “in actualit -it is not

preven that this will reduce" ' I.
fatalities." Gawley said. 
“SASU feels very strongly
about saving lives of the eighteen
-year ‘,old;.vtarget. group.” said
Gawle'y. ‘it'atalityis our-issue." '
With these“ argumentsl.ﬂ_and- raw

senators. legislators. and .
assembly members. “From
[meeting with legislators I've .
found. them. to be more open;_.
‘ minded than I anticipated," said
Michael Solomon, Central Conn:-
cil member and Lobby Leader.‘
“All the statistics that they
[legislators] have seen are very =
one~sided.f’ he said, “and they
were anxious to hear our side and
.fnake agfair judgement." ‘~ 'y' '

"Overall," said Ganey.
“from.the people we have lob-
bled we have not seen a foregone
conclusion on the decision, a lot
of mutual respect was felt at the
caitol."

However. according to. Larry
