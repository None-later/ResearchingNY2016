Block finds garlic has blood‘ttﬁinhing effects

By Charles A. Coon '

A new compound that could
help prevent strokes and heart at-
tacks has been derived from garlic
by a University researcher.

SUNYA Chemistry Professor
Eric Block and graduate student
Saleem Ahmad have produced a
compound that prevents blood
from beginning to clot.

Block said his discovery of the -

compound “ajoene” (pronounc-
ed ah-hoe-een) has resulted in the
production of “a totally new class
of compound." adding that “if a
good drug can be found from this
compound, it could find use in

treatment and prevention of heart' ‘

disease. stroke.
arteriosclerosis."

Ajoene is derived from garlic.
The methodology of producing
ajoene~from garlic is part of pa-
tent applications filed by the
SUNY Research Foundation and
SUNYA. The patent applications
were filed in December, 1984 and

phlebitis and

listed Block'and Ahmad as co-

inventors.

Block said the objective of en-
suing experimentation will be to
discover “if there is some
derivative of ajoene that would be
effective in clinical use.“ Using
their techniques. Block and
Ahmad are “producing and
testing a new compound every
week,” Block said. if some of
these compounds are found to be
medically effective. phar-
maceutical companies would vie
for the right to use Block and
Ahmad's invention.

Block said the compound may
be in the garlic humans eat, but
that that has not yet been fully

"at t!” WW ’

' University chemist Eric Block
“A totally new class of compound"
determined.

in addition to Ahmadr Block
also works with chemists from
Caracas. Venezuala and Delaware
on the project. although he used‘
different methods to abstract the
ajoene than the other researchers.

The discovery of ajoene is the

latest landmark in research on the
medicinal properties of garlic and
onions. in his article to be
published in the March issue of

Scientiﬁc American. Block tells, ‘
of the history of the medicinal
and chemical properties of garlic

and onions. Block is also the

author of the textbook Reactions

Clint! OMINI UPS

of Organosulfur Compounds and
has published about

various articles.

He, an expert on sulfur
chemistry. Was‘ awarded a
prestigious Guggenheim
Fellowship in 1984. one of only

fourteen chemists in the United

 

seventy ._

    

 

States and Canada to 'be so
honored. Former Guggenheim
Fellowship winners include com-
poser Aaro'n Copeland and
chemis Linus Pauling. who in-
vented the Polio vaccine. .
_ According-to Block’s Scientific
American articie. garlic is an-
.tifungal as well as antibiotic. thus
protecting itselfagainst decay in-
duced. by fungus. ‘Garlic and
onions", irritating nature also
repels‘eertain animals. .

The article states that the an-
cient Greeks “considered the

"' odor of garlic and onions vulgar
"and prohibited garlic and‘onion

eaters from worshipping at the
temple of Cybele." ’ g

. The reason _ garlic .has
perservered” over the centuries is
medical. Block said. According to
the article, “the Phoenicians and

- the Vikings took garlic with- them

on long voyages to treatrva'rious
ailments common to sailors...The
Roman naturalist Plinythe Elder
gave numerous therapeutic: uses
for both garlic and‘ onions.
Garlic. he said, relieves

ghoarseness and expels iapeworms '

and other parasites; onions in-

, ducc sleep, cure ‘feebleness of vi-

sion’ and heal sores, dogbites,
toothaches. dyscentery, .lumbago
and hemorrhoids.” the article
states.

Block’s article. also tells of '

more I contemporary .medicinal
'usesof’garlic. “in 1858, Louis
Pasteur reported that :garlic was
antibacterial." The article‘ states
that garlic was used in both w'orld"
wars. with some success. as an'an-
tiseptic in the prevention of

Students who live downtown will
soon have an attractive alternative to
studying. at the uptown library as
Hawley Library. SUNYA’s Graduate
Library of Public Affairs and Policy..
undergoes renovations.

Hawley first opened its doors in 1909.
and is now under construction in order
to restore the building's basic systems

 
  
  
      
  

ports. The building “didn;t comply with
code. The‘systems hadn’t been changed
since the building was built." said Ruth
Fraley. head librarian at Hawley.

Funds for renovations were initially
requested i0 years ago. and the project.
with a cost of approximately 5412.000
was ﬁnally funded one year ago, said
Dennis Stevens. Assistant Vice Presi-
dent and Director of SUNYA’s plant
department.

structed. there were no computers or

Martin Rogers, the contractor hired
to make the renovations. has stated
summer of 1985 as the expected date of
completion. said Fraley, adding that

“Beginning next week everything in the
basement will be moved to the ﬁrst
'floor, and everything on the first floor
will be moved to the basement." said
Fraley. Students won't be able to enter
the building through the first floor. but
rather through the basement, she said.
emphasizing that “students need to
know it is open."

Fraley said she thinks users of Hawley
would have preferred having the renova-
tions done at a different time. “it's very
disruptive," she explained.

it's not,,easy to renovate a building
when it is still in use, said Stevens, ad«
ding that SUNYA is “trying to provide
service and renovate it at the same
time.”

Stevens said he would like to see
Hawley made as functional as possible.

Through the use of state of the art
technology. SUNY Central can now access
_ data that measures public attitudes
towards SUNY.

The technology is called Galileo, a
method of Computer Analysis developed
by SUNY professor Joseph Woelfei.
Galileo is able to receive information.
analyze it. and make it instantly accessible
to a terminal located at SUNY Central. ac-

    
   
    
   
   

   
 

' dinator Mike Corso.
, .‘ The study. titled Community Attitudes
- Towards SUNYA (CATS). is a statewide
» survey distibuted by SUNYA's Rockefeller
" institute. Between 1000 and 2000 New
‘  York State residents have been surveyed so
far.

The Galileo Program diagrams public
'3 opinion. it measures relationships between
.. various emotions to beliefs about the
 SUNY system, Corso said. it measures

1 both general opinion and importance sur-
rounding particular issues. he added.
 A random sample is drawn from various
 constituencies: parents. students. Ad~
ministration. faculty. Alumni, high school
guidance counselors. media executives,
legislators. government agency heads. etc.
' Galileo takes the information. and each
' ' constituency is positioned on the graph in
. , relation to SUNY.

 Galileo computing System makes
information accessible SUNY wide

cording to Rockefeller institute Coor-l

 

mation. tlte SUNY Central Universtiy Af-
fairs ofﬁce can access it. This office is
working closely with the Rockefeller
institute.

SUNYA graduate and undergraduate
students from the Communications
department are conducting the surveys.
employing both phone and mail techni-
ques. SUNY is paying for the surveys. but
very little cost is involved beyond paper
and other supplies, Corso said.

This CATS project is unique. Corso
said, in that pioneer technology is being
used. in SUNYA’s research based com-
munication's department. said graduate
student Victor Bye. every communications
major will work on the project. Galileo “is
going to become the public opinion expert
system." said Bye.

The project may also help SUNY
graduates. he said. By measuring public
perceptions. appropriate public relations
and/or funding in certain areas “can move
SUNY in their eyes to a more favorable
image. thereby raising the credibility of
our gratis." stated Bye. adding, “we can
move SUNY towards that ideal image. it'll
mean jobs for SUNY students.”

in a university market where prestige is
becoming a matter of dollars and cents.
Corso said. SUNY finds itself in a unique
position. The Galileo program enables the
CATS survey to become highly valid. he
added. saying. future budget appropria-
tions may be decided upon it. E]
