Communication may be aid
to campus racism problem

(COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE) Racism still
haunts blacks and other minorities at
mostly-white campuses. but the best thing
colleges can do is face the problem and
start talking about it, a new Association of
American Colleges (AAC) study said. 1
At the same time, black-white student

relations are taking historical turns at a.

number of predominantly-white. southern
schools. which in recent weeks have taken
steps to integrate their fraternities and
sororities.

Most college students and faculty
members continue to harbor racial
stereotypes. said Carolyn Spatta. author
of the just-released AAC report and vice
president for administration and business
at Cal State-Hayward. “And the best thing
we can do is to first acknowledge that these
stereotypes do exist. Whites have them of
blacks, and blacks have them of whites.”
Spatta said.

Such stereotypes. however. particularly
hurt black students on predominantly-
white campuses, she said. “Whenever a
black student goes to a mostly-white cam-
pus, everybody gets the idea that this is a
poor student from an unstable. inner-city
family," she explained. “But in fact the
black student could just as easily be from a
well-to-do, traditional family in the
suburbs."

For the black student surrounded by a
sea of white faces, the stereotypes can
harm his or her schooling, Spatta'said.
Most harmful, she noted, are the “feelings
of isolation, lack of faculty and ad-
ministrative role models, and exclusion of
black figures and black contributions in
their subject areas."

“Both black and white students (often
feel) the black student is little more than a
token on a mostly-white campus,” she
said. But confronting these problems,
Spatta says. can help students and faculty
overcome them.

“We’re encouraging campuses to take a
workshop approach or hold other related
activities that allow students and faculty to
realize the effects of racism and how to
deal with it." she said.

Sparta said she

thinks instructors

especially need to ask themselves. “How
does racism affect my teaching?" and
“How does it affect my students’ learn-
ing?” Black students. she said. also need

to establish “support groups" to share .

feelings of isolation and frustration, “ac-
cept the fact that getting their degree is a
l'our or ﬁve year goal and not let racism
deter them from that goal." and “unders-
tand the history and past experiences of
racism on their campus."

At the same time the AAC released its
report, several campuses reported historic
progress in integrating their students.
Black and white sororities and fraternities
at the University of Georgia, for instance,
just voted to merge under one governing
council after years of having separate
councils. “We’re very positive about the
merger," said Joe Fleming, president of
Georgia's newly-integrated lnterfraternity
Council. “People are ﬁnally starting to
realize the benefits we all can have from
this. We will be stronger for uniting."

At the University of Arkansas. three
minority students have pledged at three of
the campus’ traditionally-white fraternities
and sororities. Last year. eight Arkansas
sororities lost privileges granted to
registered organizations for refusing to
sign a pledge not to discriminate. They
eventually signed the pledge last January.

University of Texas-Austin students.
too, have been struggling to integrate their
greek systems. All the houses at UT have
signed the university’s non-discriminatory
agreement “and there are some integrated

fraternities with a few.blacks." reported ‘

Eric Weber. UT's lnterfraternity Council
advisor. But black and white houses still
function under separate governing coun-
cils. Weber said. _

Like Georgia. Texas’ next step_is to
merge the councils. but conflictsonboth
sides have stopped it so far. Weber said.
Not much is likely to change until they.
merge, however. “You’d have to be ma
first group to break the tradition (of allow-:-
ing blacks into a traditionally-white
group)" noted Julie McNichols. president
of Alpha Xi Delta. El

Cocaine is exception to diminishing
nationwide high school drug abuse

(CPS) Drug use among high school seniors
- this year‘s college freshmen - declined for
the fifth consecutive year in 1984 for all
commonly-used drugs except cocaine. the
results of a nationwide survey released last
week indicate.

According to the survey. 5.8 percent of
the high school seniors questioned last spr-
ing had used cocaine in the most recent
month. up front 4.9 percent the previous
year. Among students in the northeast sec-
tion of the. country. the figure jumped
from 6.9 to ll'perccnt.

But use of all other drugs on the survey -
including LSD. PCP. cigarettes, alcohol.
marijuana, sedatives. and tranquilizers -
was down.

The percentage of. regular marijuana
smokers; for example, dropped one-half a
percentage point to five percent. down
from the 1978 peak of 11 percent.

The continuing decline stems from an
increasingly widespread view that drug use
is risky and. unacceptable behavior. said
survey director Lloyd Johnston ol‘ the
University of Michigan.

“in the long run, this may be the only
battle in the war against drugs that society
can really win." Johnston said of the bid
to change students’ attitudes toward drug
use. The attempts to control the supply
and price of drugs are likely to fail. he
said.

lint others. while accepting the validity
of Johnston‘s methodology. suggest other
factors may account for the continuing
decline.

“The use of achiever drugs. such as co~

caine. is going up, while the use of relaxing
drugs is going down." noted Kevin Zecse.
director of the National Organization for
the Reform of Marijuana Laws, which
discourage the use of controlled substances
but favors making marijuana legal.

“We're not so much solving the drug
problem as changing it," Zecse said.

Joanne Gampel, director of the Center
on Marijuana and Health. suggested that
students' increased emphasis on learning
marketable skills is changing drug use
habits.

“People want to be energized," she
said. “Marijuana doesn’t do that.
Students can’t work while on marijuana.
but they can while on cocaine."

There are even signs of an increasing co-
caiuc habit among politically conservative
college students. not normally drug ex-
perimenters. Gampcl said.

“One student at the University of
Maryland told me the word on campus is
that students don't feel that cocaine is a
drug." (iampel said. “it’s just something
that gives you strength and energy. They
want to get ahead in the world. so using
something that gives you energy is okay."

Johnston dismisses these explanations,
arguing the increase in cocaine use tuition-
wide since 1983 is statistically insignificant.

What's more. Johnston's survey lll-
dicutcs students are increasingly wary of
cocaine. in I983. 74 percent of them said
they thought there is great risk in cocaine
use. Last year. the figure jumped to 79
percent.

" (CPS) Since 1981. “we’ve scraped I

and hunted and hoped" for
students. saidthe registrarxof a
major North Carolina-university.
“and we kept (enrollment). up.
But now, it's catching up to us."
“It” is the long-anticipated.

population. 1 -

‘ While; many small. four-year
liberal arts colleges have struggled

cent years. last fall even two-year 7

colleges, long the fastest-growing

campuses in the county, lost near- -

ly two percent of their students.
the National Association of Com-
munity and Junior Colleges
reported. ‘

And big-name campuses like
Delaware. 'Penn State, .St.
Bonaventure. Miami. Alabama.
Georgia Tech, Kentucky, Arkan-
sas. the entire University of
Missouri system. Marquette, New
Mexico and Arizona. among
many others, also reported enroll-
ment declines last autumn. "I
think it may be the start of the
decline nationwide,”
Deborah Haynes. assistant admis-
sions director at South'Carolina.
which has ,four percent fewer
students this year than last.

“This is certainly the beginning
of the expected drop." asserted
Dr. C. Doyle Bickers of West
Georgia State. “I think we’re
beginning to see the effects of the
predicted decline," added Dr.
James Kellerman of Fort Hays
State University in Kansas.

Although all responses -from
the legislators were not' positive.
the lobbyers were extremely en-v
thusiastic about the day.
“Lobbying was a great ex-
perience and 1 am looking for-
ward to going back," said one
lobbyist, Stephanie Kay.

“You actually see the political

process in action, you are the lob-
byists they speak about in our tex-
tbooks." said Gawley, “it is very
exciting to know that you really
have a chance to ,affect the opi-
nion of individual legislators and
the actual course of the
legislature.”

“i think the students who lob-

. byed learned more in a day' at the,

legislature than you canlcarn in a
whole semester political science
course." he added. I

Gawley explained that SASU is
a well respected group that evolv-
ed from "a bunch of unorganized

protectors to a well developed and ‘

well organized Student Advocacy
Organization. We support our
views with hard data and we still
have a youthful spirit that carries
many of our causes to victory."

Plans for the future. said
Gawley, are to continue lobbying
efforts. “until we see evry
legislator, all 211 of them.” He
added. “We will. of course. con-
centrate on those wavering in
hope of swaying their vote."

“It is going to be a tough
fight." said Gawley,.“butwe are
up for the challenge." C]

however. “The South Dakota

‘South Dakota's

Board of
Regents. “This puzzles and sur-

. prises us.'We didnot expect this"

at what has been a very popular

Even if nationwide numbers
approach 1983’s . the downward
trend is expected to accelerate.
“We think the enrollment trend is
just'beglnning, and will last into
the mid-1990’s.” said Vance
Grant of the NCES in
Washington. 0.0.

The reason is that there are
simply fewer high school-aged
people in the pipeline that usually
provides students for colleges.

'This year. the number of high

school grads dropped six percent.

There'll be‘some» 50.000 fewer
high school grads next fall. and
the total could fall to about’2.3
million by 1992. the College
Board predicted. “There is a pr-
jected ﬁve percentdecline each
year in the college-bound popula-
tion. and that is drastic." s'aid Dr.
Glenn Carter, Penn State's
associate admissions dean. ‘

“The ﬁrst thing to go in a com-
munity college.” says James
Mahoney of the American
Association of Community Col-

leges, “is the part-time faculty." '3-

’. “A declining ‘enrollment can
affect a school in a number of

. ways. but I feel the impact will be

felt‘ across the board: it affects
everything from the quality of the
football team tothe existence of
the school." suggests Terry
Maurer, Eastern Washington

~ University’s spokesman.

Some New Mexico ad-
ministrators fear a long-term
enrollment .decline could force
them to fire 50 to 60 faculy
members, while Minnesota and

'Michigan.. among many other

states, are.coneocting plans to
merge and close various academic
programs to avoid expensive

1' duplications.

But the number of high school

'grads has been dropping for

years. from a high of three
million in 1979. and colleges have

’coped by recruiting more “non-

traditional,” generally older
students. The difference this year
is that recruiting nontraditional

students is getting harder because
of the improved econbmy; » ‘

“College is not necessary for
better jobsin today's economy.”
said Larry Stiles. the University

of Tennessee's assistant dean of

admissions. “if people can come
out of high school and can get a
job. then they ‘don’t go to col-
lege," added Sherie Story of the
Washington State Community
College Board.

If they don't go to two-year
colleges. which are suffering their
worst enrollment drops in 20
years. they don't transfer to four-
year colleges."‘There are not as
many transfer students conning
out of community colleges
because they don't have students.
either," pointed out Glenn Allen
of the University of Missouri at
St. Louis.

Many administrators profess

they're unconcerned. Ofﬁcials at
Tennessee and South [Carolina at-
tributed their enrollment declines
to tough new academic standards.
which cause some students to
drop out. Still others simply
won't acknowledge decreases for
any reason. “Schools hate to ad-
mit they’re experiencing -a
decline." said Dr. Haskin Pounds
of the University ' of Georgia
system. 

“Education leaders hear storie
that ,their competition ‘ is doing
better, and they don"t'want to ad-
mit they’re not doing well." add-
ed William McNamara,
spokesman for the National
Association of independent Col-
leges and Universities (NAlCU).

“They fear negative publicity," .
said South Dakota's Foster, “and
if a school is shown to be a non-
prosperous institution. it won't
attract students."

But, inevitably, hope is spring-
ing eternal. “The declines are
supposed to last into 'the
mid-1990’s." McNamara noted.
“But the wonderful thing about
our world is that predictions and
surveys don't hold up a lot.” [:1
