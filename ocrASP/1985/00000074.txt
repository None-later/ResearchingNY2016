The Albany State men’s swimming team
was victorious against Binghamton in
their last home meet of the season. 68-45.

This past Saturday the men were ag-
gressive and it was evident in the pool.

“We did well today. We went into the
meet knowing that they were better than
they were in the past. but we proved to be
the better team.” stated captain Jeff Ball.
“There was an outside possibility that they
might’ve won. but we were just a lot
stronger. We had a tough line up and by
the time the meet was half way over. we
were sure that we’d win."

The swimmers put in some great perfor-
mances and several records were broken.

Jeff Kennedy, a prime example. beat his
record in the 1000 yard freestylewith a
time of 10:37. He also pulled an incredible
time of 2:10 in the 200 yard backstroke- a
season‘s best for Kennedy. ‘ '

Once again, Fred Greenbaum had a
great day. He swam in the 200 yard
freestyle. coming up with an amazing time
of 1:51. Furthermore, in the 100 yard
freestyle. he swarn a season’s best of 49.8.

Frank Parker must also be commended
for his skill in the 200 yard butterﬂy. He
took second with a time of 2:15, which was
his best time of the year.

Jeff Ball did well in the 200 Individual
Medley. He took second with a time of
2:15, which beat his previous record by a
couple of seconds. '

“Me and the other guy went head to
head. it was a great race and i was really
happy." commented Ball. . .

In the 200 yard freestyle. Michael
Wright had a fine time of 1:54. Wright
also swam in the 500 yard freestyle. but
was not too enthused with his
performance. ' '

Hazime Dupo was disappointed with his
time of 2:04 in the 200 yard butterfly. He ,

taking a time of :54;_'

Frank Cawley just missed qualifying for
the States with a time of 1258.6 in the 200
yard freestyle.

Dean Wilson .swam the 200 yard.

breaststroke with a time of 2:31 which was
his best of the season.

Mike Feldman had a good day against
Binghamton. He felt that his times were
consistent, which pleased him. Feldman
performed well in all three of his events.
He swam the 100 yard freestyle. 50 yard
freestyle. and in the 400 yard freestyle
relay. ‘

Freshman Mike Koutelis swam well in
the 200 yard breaststroke, taking ﬁrst in
that race.

J_im Neiland qualiﬁed for the States in the
500 yard freestyle with a ﬁne time of 5:29.

Andrew Motola had a great day against
Binghamton. He swam in ‘.he 200 yard In-
dividual Medley grabbing a super time of
2:14. Motola also swam in the 400'yard
freestyle relay clocking another fantastic
time of :53.

The Danes took first in the 400-yard'

freestyle relay with a dynamic time of 3:26.
Feldman led off with Kennedy swimming
second. Handy in the third slot, and
Greenbaum finishing off.

Tom Handy had an amazing time of

5:13 in the 500 yard freestyle taking first v

place. '

“'1 was very pleased .with the team’s per.
formance. The whole team is improving."
commented Handy. “it's very important
that our times continue to drop at~this
crucial‘point in the season." ' .

The divers also played an important role _

in clinching this victory against Bingham-’

_ton. Mike Vardy took first in‘rthe' one

meter competition. while Mike Cano took

third. iii—the three meter .‘Vard‘y took se- .
 "n ’thirdi‘ 

On the whole, the Danes swam'better
than they expected to. making an exciting
victory for the swimmers.

“We looked'good [in the events we
swam. The guys are looking better every- >
day with their times continually dropp-

hopefully' take another _vietory against

Union. The team seems optimistic and en; '
