Minoritiesurged to stand Up and becounted:

 

av Patrice Johnson

“As long as I am stilled and kept
i am safe and liked

They see me as a positive force
As soon as i move ans rise

i become dangerous and disliked
Then they must seek a cage

To lock in my negativity"

Having to overtly stand up and
express your feelings and ideas
about harsh realities confronting
minorities on a predominately
white campus may create some
degree of tension and hostility to
exist between the respective races.

This is truly unfortunate;
however, hostility nor tension can
prevent me from writing about
the visible and hidden imbalances
and biases that victimize
minorities and thus. serve to keep
them in their “fixed” place.

Silence. although often needed
nd seen as positive in appropriate
situations. can be one‘s worst
enemy. As long as we silence our
voice to our pains and victimiza-
tions. we can never find the solu-
tions for our healing. A major
setback is when one complains.
but never acts to dismiss that

complaint. No justices or
equalities have ever been handed
off a silver platter to one who pa-
tiently and passively sits for some
change to occur. When you want
something bad enough. you work
for it..Eorthis‘reason. l strive to
tell others 'of the injustices impos-
etl upon them with the, fervent
hope that some change will come.

What’s really'u'nfor'tunate is

, that when we'try to accomodate
antif'el‘evate "ourselves as.
minorities in'. a predominately "

"reety. “However.

white‘ipstituti'on. hostility‘an’d ins
timidation‘are often-created. Our
will and strong desire for‘ some
sense of fairness is viewed
negatively. and our means of
deliverance is projected as mili-
tant. Minorities can often feel the
will of others for them to be still-
ed and to remain in their proper
place. Doesn‘t a group of people
have the right to try to elevate
themselves itt a society where
things are not always equally ac-
cessible to them and an imbalance
is clearly juxtaposed if we fail to
express ourselves and feellings. no
change can formulate and thus.
we shall remain constant.
Addressing the letter sent to the
editor of the ASP in the February
5 issue which referred to this col-
umn. the author suggested that
the messages that my column
relayed are negative. To some ex-
tent. i must agree with this un-
natned author. My column tends
to reﬂect negativity. but the
messages are positive ones. What
is actually negative in my column
What is negative is the harsh
realities confronting minorities on
campus. The truths about the

organizational structure in the
classrooms. dormitories. and in
planning student activities are all
of a negative nature because of
theirtequality involved.

Although 'we are aware of the
foul play and circumstances. we
still can project our positivity and
perserverance while

.. simultaneously focusing ourselves

'on making-a positive change. So
when the'autlto‘r suggested that
some degree of negativity exists in
this column. he ‘was partially cor-
’ th'e- - negatiVe
elements are4the negative ine-
qualities and unfairness that con-
front ‘minoriti'es on a
predominately rwhite'campus. i
hope that the unnamed author
will come to recognize the ig«
norance he-she has in understan—
ding the experiences minorities
face. The author exemplified the
negativity that he-she vividly. but
misguidedly wrote about. This
column aims to awaken all to
what's really taking place. it aims
to raise the consciousness of
others while making them ar-
ticulate of the minority ex-
perience. It aims to enlighten the
majority to the confrontations
imposed on minorities with a
hope that they will come to
understand our‘ needs and foun-
dations as a group. it aims to
highlight tghe cold cruel realities
that may seem trivial to many,
but significant to stain the i am
of those whom these realities af-
fect. It aims to persuade the op-
pressed to progress and to acheive
in all facets against the odds.
Lastly, it. aims to produce a
positiVe change and breakthrough

 

 

for minorities that we may not be
here to individually benefit from.
but the minorities that follow. us
may come to kndw of its glory.

l truly hope that minorities will
hold fast to their goals». active
dreams, and to each other so that
as we rise in a world that gives us
little room to do so, our fellow

. sisters and brothers can riSe also.

We must make our own' room.
Through all the clouds and
storms. we must make our own
skies. We must not solely depend
on others to serve as elevators. for
we must take ourselves to the top. '
We .tist find the light at the end

day night from the Campus Center lobby.

According to a GALA spokesperson,
the banner. which was made for the party
to be held this Saturday, ‘was last seen
Wednesday night at 5 pm. “A lot of time
and effort went into the banner. it has a
lot of sentimental value." he said, adding

“Administrators have complained of

actual work hours due to contruction
noise. : 

“Several faculty members called me to
complain about the noise" Thursday. said
Assistant Vice President for facilities,
Dennis Stevens. “The contractor promised
me that he wouldn't work during class
time," said Stevens. "1 was disturbed that
hewent against my request."

“it was never anyone’s intent to diSrupt

. classes." said. Stevens. Contruction that is

noisy will be done on weekends and before

classes in. the morning. he said. -“.The'

greatestipart of the construction wilLbe

«done during spring break in April." said

Stevens.

Light ilxture switch

- New floureseent light bulbs will replace.

the old incandescent bulbs in basement
corridors on the podium and new ceilings
will be erected. said facilities engineer.
Charles Estey. ~

The new bulbs wiial burn three times as
long as the incandescent ones and the new
ceilings will be more accessible for repairs.
said Estey. New ceilings have already been
erected in the Business, Administration
and Humanities buildings. .

Repairs will be ﬁnished by the summer,
said Estey, adding that these same repairs

on the other floors of the buildings would.

be considered.

New life for the Rat

“Students are coming back to the
Rathskellar, and Snack Bar in‘ the even:
ings.” said Director of Campus Center
Operations Lester Hynes, adding that sales
are up about is; percent since “Save the
Rat Night" on 'January 31.

Hynes credited the sales increase to the

efforts of students on the University Aux- ,_ ,
iliary Services (UAS) Board of Directors. , ,

and students on the “Save the Rat Night"
committee. “Theylve come up with some

novel publicity and entertainment ideas." .

he said. i '
Interest in using the Rathskeilar for par-
ties has increased, said Hynes.

teachers are nearing retirement. Albany
has one of the largest programs in the
state. but according to Koff, a shortage
in business teachers is not a reason for
the continuance of the program at
Albany. “Just because there is a signifi-
cant demand for a product doesn’t
mean we ought to produce it,” he said.

The protestors‘ list of demands nam-
ed Monday as their deadline for a
response from the administration. but
SA officials and business education
students will be meeting with President
O'Leary. on Wednesday to discuss the
future of the program. “We’re hoping
we’ll get the program approved and ade-
quately staffed." Schaf fer said.
