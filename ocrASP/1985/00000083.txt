SUNYA students- living
downtown or in the Wellington
could be exposed to;hazardous
chemicals in the air if an en-
vironmental group‘s recent ﬁn-
dings are correct.

The Albany New York' Waste
Energy Recovery System
(ANSWERS), located on
Sheridan Avenue, is emitting
chemicals into the air from its »
stacks, and it is possible that diox-
ins found in the stacks may also
be in the air. Executive Director
of the Environmental Planning
Lobby (EPL), Judith Enck has
announced.

“The public is being exposed to
much higher levels of particulates
than is deemed acceptable. The
plant should be shut down and
immediately retrofitth with a
more efficient particulate control
technology," said SUNY Stony
Brook chemistry professor,
Theodore Goldfarb. '

Particulates are toxic chemical
particles which are part of emis-
sions from the stacksof source
recovery plants, said Erick.

Two SUNYA students, Yvette
Lequne and Lisa Strain. and
Skidmore College student Suzan-
na Benson, are working as
Legislative Associates for the
EPL and have contributed to
Enck's analysis of ASNSWERS.

After they.took a tour‘of the
plant Strain said that*"‘We were.
covered with soot and the place
was really gross. We were given
masks to tour the plant with.”
Benson added that, “l was disap-
pointEdr thatrs-tho: people -at the .
plant seemed. less concerned. with
air emissions than keeping_the
plitnt running." , .

“Particulates released from the
stacks are a major problem. State
and federal authorities tested par-

added Fisher.

by teaching them how to
recognize and handle a crime and
so forth. Unfortunately. in some
programs after a while people
begin to drop out and you only
have the same few people coming
over and over again. However,
some of these programs seem to
work out and become very suc-
cessful. This is what we want to
understand. Why does this
happen"

Three other research projects
going on at the Hindlelang
Criminal Justice Research Center
may aid New York State Police
upgrade the number of felony ar-
rests that go to trial. These in-
clude a study of disturbed and
disriptive inmates in prisons. and
a project to complete a source
book on statistics for criminal
justice.

People involved in these pro-
jects include Hans Tech, 0 pro’
fessor of criminal justice at the
university and Timothy Hanagan.
an assistant professor of criminal
justice. Also. there is Maureen
McLeod, a research center
associate who is co-directing the
neighborhood watch program
with Garofalo. ‘ - '

'ticulates which were found to fail

five of the six federal standards of

the Clean Air Act," said Enck.
She added that although diox-

. ins were not detected in ambient

air tests .which are air samples
taken at various distances from
the. plant, the result is to be ex-
pected and does not assure the
public’s health. _

Enck said that the testing was
done under ideal operating condi-
tions, and if a testing .program
was done throughout a full week
of regular operation. the results
may have been quite different.

There are few federal or state
standards on toxic emissions and
none on dioxins, said Enck. The
State Department of Health pro-
jected 12 cancer deaths per
million people in a 70-year period
and accepting this. figure is a a
drastic change from the previous
standard of considering any
number greater than one death
per million as unacceptable. she
added.

“The state is telling us to relax.
They are being misleading and are
doing a bureacratic tapdance,”
said Enck.

The plant. located on Sheridan
Avenue burns processed garbage
to heat the Nelson Rockefeller
Empire State Plaza, the capitol.
and the State Legislature, explain-
ed Enck. The plant is owned by
the city, operated by the New
York State Office of General Ser-
vices, and the city of Albany
receives about $5 million each
year in revenue from it, she
added. .

.. . The issue was. brought to the
EFL by the residents of theArbor
Hill community who live near the
plant, when ears were found with .
an inch of soot one morning said
Strain, adding that others com-
plained of finding their clothes

 

black from soot after being on the
clothesline for a day. >

Enck said that the Wellington
Hotel and the student ghetto are
most affected by the plants’ emis-
sions because of the proximity to
downtown.

There are no adequate‘pollu-
tion control systems in stacks nor
Is there a monitoring system, said
Benson. to determine if hazar-
dous chemicals are being released.

“From what we know. none of '
the environmental standards are
beng enforced. Also, the main
computer hooked up to monitor
ANSWERS was not issuing daily
reports." said Benson.

EPL wants th issue resolved
soon and have It reatened to sue
the Department of Environmental
Conservation to force them to
share their test results with the
public. said Erick. The current
report is only preliminary and the
final report has yet to be released.
The study began in September.

' 1983, she said.

“There are about 25 plant: te-
ing proposed in the state. five of
which are near the New York
City-Long island area which has
the worst landfill problem in New
York,” said Benson.

“You have to have both air
emissions control devices. and
monitoring of emissions for either
to be truly viable. ,Why bother
having air emissions control if
you can't see that it's working,”
asked Benson.

As a solution, Benson sug-
gested‘ “Source Separation," a
process of removing plasters and

metals .from the trash because -

“these substances give off toxic
emissions." . _
“Why burn something which
can be recycled -—- it’s not only
cost efficient but environmentally

sound." said Benson. [3 ‘
