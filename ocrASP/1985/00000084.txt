Women’s track team ge

By Jeff Mallab'er
Long ago and far away, someone
decided to make track and field a team
sport. The bottom line though, is the
athlete against the'clock. one on one.
Nowhere has that been more plainly
demonstrated than on this -year's
women’s indoor track team. The lady
v tracksters lack the team depth necessary
to compete as a group against the
stronger teams. The light at the end of
the tunnel has been the great individual
performances by a number of the girls.
Coach Ron White is full of optimism.
despite the problems. “We're not a deep
team," he said, “The quality efforts
we're getting have been outstanding
though.”
On February 9, the ladies traveled to
Cortland to compete in the Cortland ln-

vitational. The Danes came in seventh in
a field of fourteen teams. Syracuse
University came away with first place.

Once again, Bette Dzamba and Don-
na Burnham, this year’s two steadiest
performers, provided the brightest spots
for Albany State in the meet. Both girls
came away with school records in their
respective events.

Dzamba ran the 5000 meters in

l8:36.8 for a school record. Said Coach _

White, "Bette is having an excellent
season." Dzamba has had several per-
sonal bests this year and ﬁgures to write
a few more lines on the school record
book before she’s done.

Burnham took fifth place in the l500
meters in 4245.4, another new school
record. Said Donna, “The whole team is
improving. We‘re going to be a lot

stronger. as a team outdoors."

Anita Heath continuedto be Albany’s
best sprinter, capturing fifth place in the
200 meters with a time of 28.8 seconds.

ln the 3000 meters, Lynn Jacobs cap-
tured fifth place in a time of 10:37.9, her
personal best. .

The four by 800 meter relay team of
Burnham. Heath, Rachel Braslow, and
Roseanne Smith placed fourth with a
time of 10:32.8.

Then. on Saturday, the girls traveled
north to meet a tough Plattsburgh team.
Plattsburgh took the meet with an ex-
tremely one-sided team score of 104 to

. 22. Once again. though, there were in-

dividual highlights for the Albany girls.
Again Dzamba starred, this time in
the 3,000 meters. She captured first
place in the event with a time of 10:48.3.
Patti Barrett had an impressive triple

 

at the Plattsburgh meet. Barrett gave '

season's best performances in the 300

meter run, the long jump. and the triple ,

jump to capture ﬁrst, second, and

fourth places respectively. Coach White '

. is very pleased with Barrett’s develop-
ment. “Patti has really improved ‘her
performance this season.”

Coach White is preparing several of '

his athletes for the New York State
Championships this weekend at
Hamilton College. Bette Dzamba. Don-
na Burnham, Anita Heath, Karen Kur-
thy, and Lynn Jacobs will represent the
- Danes. With his eye toward the outdoor
season. White points out that a lot of
girls have recently begun working out
with the team to get in shape. With the
added depth, the Danes may prove

- much stronger. Time, as always, will

tell.

The junior varsity basketball team
provided a packed University gym with
the beginning of .a night of upsets,
‘ defeating Junior College of Albany,
57-56, on a lay-up by Brett Axelrod at
the buzzer. " ‘

The play occurred after J .C.A. scored
on an outside jumper which gave them a
56-55 lead. The shot dropped in the net
with 7 seconds left.,and the Danes im-
mediately called for a timeout. But it
was not granted until four precious
seconds had elapsed off the clock. The
Danes inbounded the ball with 3 seconds

hands of Freeze Storey, who put up a

stormed the referees as the Danes
celebrated at midcourt. After a few
tense moments, Albany fans were able
to cheer this upset victory. _

The team came out at the start of the
contest and played their best team
basketball yet this season, according to
head coach Jim Boland, “the ﬁrst 20-
minutes of the game our defense played
the best they've played this year."

The Danes were also hamperedby the
poor officiating which allowed too
much contact inside, 'faecording to "
Boland. Still. Albany went into the '
locker room holding 1131-19 lead.

“We were playing a good" defense

throughout the game, which we normal— ‘ :-
