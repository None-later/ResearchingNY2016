Fresh from a full week’s worth of rest
from duel matches, Coach Joe DeMeo
took the winningest wrestling team in
Albany State history to the SUNYAC
tournament in Buffalo last weekend, hop-
ing to finish fourth and qualify his top
three wrestlers, Shawn Sheldon.’ Dave
Averill and Andy Seras, for the NCAAs to
be held in Rock island, lllinois.

By the end of the two day tournament.
the Dane grapplers, now ranked an all-
time high fifth in Division III. had taken
third place, scoring 107 14 points.The
Dane grapplers lost second place to Buf-
falo by one point, while qualifying six
wrestlers for the NCAAs. Brockport was
the overall winner with 111 34.

high intensity level and electric at-
mosphere which may have con~
tributed to the outbreak of a
bench-clearing brawl with
seconds left in the game. Sauers
called the incident “unfortunate”
and hoped nothing further would
come of it.

After about four or five
minutes of fighting, the Universi-
ty Police were called in and order
was restored.

Although Potsdam has four
players from the Capital District
on their squad, Sauers pointed
out that "Albany State has sotne
good players from the Capital
District and the contributed to
winning this game."

The win was mtntber 499 for
Sauers and, unfortunately. this is
where he stands going into the
SUNYACs tonight following an
81-64 loss to the Hamilton Cdn-
tinentals Tuesday night at
Hamilton. ,

The game. which may have
been a let-down following their
emotional victory Saturday. Add
that to the fact that Sauers wasn't
shouting signals from the bench
for the first time in his 30-year
reign. His mother passed away on
Sunday night and the legendary
coach was unable to attend Tues-
day night’s contest. The irony
could not have been greater as
assistant coach Barry Cavanaugh
was at the helm trying to secure
Sauer’sSOOth
victory. .’

While satisfied with his team’s overall

performance, DeMeo was most excited'

with the number of individuals Albany
State will be sending to the Nationals. The
Danes will be represented by Shawn
Sheldon (118), Dave Averill (126), John
Balog (134), Jim Fox (146), Andy Seras
(158) and Sandy Adelstein (177).
Sheldon, Averill, and Seras qualified as
SUNYAC champions. For Sheldon it was
his first SUNYAC title, Averill’s second

tein qualified as wild-card recipients.

three champions. Taking six guys is
phenomenal, it’s the most we've ever
had." .

“Andy Seras deﬁnitely deserves special '

recognition," said ,DeMeo. “Andy is the
ﬁrst person in 19 yearsto have won four
SUNYAC titles, and that was back when

'there' were. only four teams in the

SUNYAC. That's a very outstanding,
unbelievable accomplishment."

Of his team's overall performance,
DeMeo was.satisfied, if not enthusiastic.

“Overall, we performed well,” said
DeMeo. "We just didn't have a lot of the
lucky things you like to‘have happen."

in particular, DeMeo acknowledges
Marty-Pidel's tough match at 167 in which
he lost by, one point in the ﬁnal second of
the last period to Potsdam’s Mike Price.

DeMeo also pointed out Matt Ryan,
Albany's top 190 pound wrestler. who has

5 been suffering from an ' kle injury'since

‘ the Dan‘e’s match against the Coast Guard
Academy in January. Ryan lost_the deci-
sion to Brockport's Dennis Leonard. by
default. ’

The NCAA Division 11] Tournament in
which Averill hopes to defend his title,
while Seras, Sheldon, Balog, Fox and
Adelstein will attempt to capture their first
championships. will be on March 1 and 2.
In addition. the grapplers will be trying to
qualify for the Division 1 Nationals.

“1 want to be an All-American,” said
Fox. "Hopefully I’ll finish in the top
four."

“I just want to make it to the second
day," said Averill. “Then [’11 get around
to worrying about defending my title.” V
