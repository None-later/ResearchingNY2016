But Albany struck back. scor-

Albany State Head Coach Dick

“The first five minutes of the se-
cond half are the most impor-
tant." And they certainly were
for the Danes.

Albany came out shooting in
the second half, outseoring the
Bears l0-2 during the first four
minutes and setting the tempo for
the rest of the game. '

But when you're playing the
number one team in the nation.

Women cagers beat Drago

By Kristine Sauer

L~ln iqui ﬁlms/s I‘ANT

The word “impressive” no longer does
justice to the achievements of the Albany
State women's
week has been phenomenal for the team.
which now boasts a 22-2 record.

Last Tuesday's 76-66 victory over the
Cortland Dragons, not only gave the
Danes a taste of sweet revenge. it put them
in first place in the SUNYAC East. Over
the weekend. they were equally incredible,
as they became the first team to take the
Capital District Tournament for three con-
secutive years.

The Dane record is the best for both
men‘s and women's basketball teams in
the Capital District. “As far as i know, the
Albany men. (204), are the closest to our
record.” said Albany head coach Mari
Warner.

Cortland didn't simply hand Albany the
win in the contest that decided first
phth in the Conference: the Danes had to
work for it. Albany State began the second
half trailing by threc points. It took them
nearly the entire third period to tie the
score at 46. A Ronnie Patterson lay up itut
the Danes ahead by a point. but not for
long as Cortland's Andrea DcStcfnno
scored. then went to the line to make a

basketball team. This .

three point play. Albany's Donna Hughes
tied the score at 53 as the Danes started to
roll.

Chris Cannnta scored off a pass from
Hughes to put the Danes ahead for good.
Rainny Lesane went to the free throw line
for four more points, and Lori Bayba
scored three to put the icing on the cake.
The Danes were now winning 64-58 with
five minutes remaining. From then on, all
was lost for Cortland.

Any comeback attempts by the Dragons
were extinguished not only by the Danes,
but due to three players fouling out in the
final minutes. This fouling in the final
minute brought Albany to the free throw
line and increased the lead. v

it’s ironic that with three seconds re-
maining Albany's 'Cindy Jensen would
score two more points from the foul line,
ending the game in the precise place when
the Danes won it. Both the Dunes and the
Dragons scored an even 24 field goals
each. While Cortland shot just over 50 per-
cent from the free throw line. the Danes
shot with 67 percent accuracy for thc l0
decisive points.

“I'm pleased with the free throwing."
said Warner. “lf we could ever be in the

70's (percent) that would be really good.

When you consider what we've been doing
50’s and 40's - we’ll take that (the 67
percent)."

Foul shooting has been a problem for
the Danes and winning this game on the
free throw line shows them they can do it.
"That's unusual for us. most of the other
learns shoot better than us," said Cannat-
ta. “it’s not that we can’t shoot fouls -‘

he; take first place

we‘re so erratic."

Aside from the friends and parents.
about thirty members of 'Pi Lambda Phi
fraternity attended the game. "The sup-
port was fantastic. It was new. it was
fresh. it was great, it gave us incentive,”
said Kosalek. “I never knew that a frat
could make that much noise.”
