Toni Morrison can-'f’teilvan idea from the
back of a bus." It .was the first meeting of a
four part workshop entitled. The Writer
Before the Page; .‘Novelist and fonner
publishing editor, Toni Morrison, designed
the workshops to examine the mysterious
creative process that a writer undergoes
when a page is empty.

-‘ Loren Ginsberg

Vincent O'Leary opened the workshop
by extending his congratulations to Toni
Morrison, who was recently awarded the
Albert Schweitzer Chair. He expressed his
excitement at the honor of having the
noted author here at SUNYA. "What an
extraordinary person to have on campus.
What an extraordinary person to have on
campusl," O'Leary exclaimed. if his repeti-

 

 

. tion of the comment made his compliment

twice as true, it was well spoken.

' Author of The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of 

Solomon and Tar Baby, Morrison drew
from her writing experiences to address
some common misconceptions about
writing. "You can actually. be rich and
write just as well as the poor,” she aserted.
"You can even by happy and write!"
Another common mistake, according to
Morrison, is that writers often fail to
distinguish between an idea and a theme.
"A theme is of absolutely no use to a
writer; it is something used by someone
who likes to talk about. writing."
Focusing on the recognition and
development of ideas, she stressed that
facts can be hindering to the creative pro
' cess. "i will not be intimidated by facts.
.That is not my job. My job is about truths,
which sometimes differ from facts. Whatl
imagine i know is simply more
interesting.” ’ . 1  _

"I will not be intimidated by
facts. That is not my job.”

' -—Toni Morrison

 

 

  
  

 

 

Toni Morrison believes that the goal of
the writer in developing an idea should be
to yield a new way of saying something.
Even‘if the subject has been dealt with
again and again, the author must focus on
specificity of detail to say something that
will have new meaning to the reader. Ac-
cording to Morrison, "if it’s going to be just
another book, you might as well write a
very, very long letter to a friend, and get it
out of your system.” '

After an entertaining and informative
workshop, the participants will never again
mistake the back of a bus for an idea. For
those that often make this mistake, Toni
Mon-ison offers encouragement in that,
“There's always the wastebasket; that's the
security.” ‘ Cl
