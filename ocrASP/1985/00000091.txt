in response to the growing-concern over I

women’s safety, Student Safety Commit-

to which Pawlewicz is a delegate. and she
organized the Student Safety Cemmitteé'

as a means of heightening awareness here. ,

“our 'goal is to improve student safety on

The Self-Defense Workshops began last

“The objective is to help women unders--,,

“Basic defense skills as well as the

‘ techniques to kill or maiman attacker are

taught.” said Ritucci-Chinni. “Basically.”
he said. “it's important to know how to

that every woman should know. You never
know when you’ll need it. Having it on the
quads is the best way to get it to the
students." she said.

Jim Williams, director of Public Safety,
who also said he supports the Self defense
initiatives, said “if it makes people feel
confident, it’s great.”

Williams also said he believes that “the
campus is very safe." adding that incidents

are “very rare.”

Some people involved in the Student
Safety Committee, however, expressed
concern over safety on campus. “Because
of the way the campus is situated,"
Ritucci-Chinni said “there is the potential
for bad situations." _

According to Pawlewicz, one of the ob-
jectives of the Student Safety Committee is
to push the administration to improve the
lighting on campus. Williams also express-
ed the concerns about lighting and said “i
wholeheartedly support any improvements
in the lighting.”

Other goals of the committee include re-
quiring all R.A.s to be instructed in self-
defense. Pawlewicz said. In this manner.
Ritucci-Chinni explained, R.A.s could
familiarize the students in the building
with self-defense techniques.

One of the students who attends the
workshops. Drucilla lamagna, said that
she participates primarily for the workout.
She also said, however. “i don't feel the
campus is safe."

Another participant, Carmel Reilly, said
that she felt safe but added that “Self
defense is worthwhile learning because if
you’re placed in 'an 'unexpected situation,
you can handle yourself." E]

DsANatlonal Youth Organizer Jeremy Korpatkln

By Eric Hlndin
STAFF WRITER

‘ The "mass left" must work together as a self-
conscious group and stop acting like special interest
groups if they hope to implement any social change
in America, according to Jeremy Karpatkin, na-
tional organizer of 'the Democratic Socialists of

America (DSA).

Speaking to about twenty-two people in the Cam-
pus Center this past Friday. some of whom were

members of BSA. Karpatkin outlined
"prerequisites" for. social change.

“Members of the mass left must recognize the
relationships between electoral and nonelectoral
politics," stated Karpatkin. adding, "Efforts to at-
tain desired change must be a continual effort. not
just an election year push.” The left must also, ac-
cording to Karpatkin. become more involved in

Excess rules found to
shackle SUNY’s future

Decision-making at
schools should be moved out of
the government and onto the
campuses. That was the message
put forth at a panel discussion
Monday, held by several state
/ legislators at a'StudentiAssocia-

tion .of the State University
‘3 Legislative Conference (SASU)

Assemblymember
chair of the Higher
Education Commission.
Senator Kenneth LaValle. chair
of the Senate Committee of
Higher Education issues, spoke
on proposed changes in legisla-
tion concerning the State budget
review process and how it ef-
fects the SUNY system.

“We must increase the par-
ticipation of students and facul-
ty in decisions which affect their

“While authority must reside
with the campus president. there
must be mechanisms by which
the president comes into contact
with the objects of his policies.
that
University is not living up to its
.great potential because of the
present structure. We need to
make the SUNY system more
adaptable to the future."
According to Tom Swan.
SASU Vice president for Cam-
pus Affairs. “The exclusion of
faculty and students is an exam-
ple of a trend by many ad-

proved. “Because a university is
run on a tight semester schedule.
such beauracracy can cause
seious delays in programming."
he said. adding that his inten-
tion is to ,eliminate such
beaucracy by bringing the
decision-making process to the
Tampus, replacing government
officials with univérsity
representatives.

Siegel's comments came after
almost two months of debate on
the issue. which was sparked by
a commission's report on the
future of SUNY. The report
urged that SUNY be allowed
greater budgeting and decision-
making powers and that the
system be released from many
of its legislative constraints.

Both ofﬁcials said they were
opposed to President Reagan’s
proposed reduction in federa
financial aid by $2.3 billion,
which would mean the elimina-
tion of nearly one-third of all
students currently receiving
federal aid.

LeValle first made it clear
that. as a Republican, he is a
staunch supporter of Reagan,
claiming that “the economy has
never been better." However.
he went on to say that he does
not agree with the President’s
policy on the proposed budget
cuts, stating that “the federal
component of financial aid is
extremely important in main-
taining access of low-income in-

politics at the state level rather than restricting their
efforts to action at the federal level.

Karpatkin suggested several directions that the
student left might pursue. if they hope to attain the
social change. First. he said. the student left must
stop treating themselves as if they were marginal.
"We must not be lntlmldaied by the myth of stu-
dent rights." .

“Students in America are not as for to the right
of the political spectrum as most people think." nor

 are students who are members of DSA as radical as
7‘ most people would believe. according to Karpatkin.
 Karpatldn cited figures from a January. 1935 ar-
tlclc In U.S. News and World Report. which
reported the results of the l9th annual survey of
first year college students conducted by the
American Council on Education and the University
of California at Les Angelou. ,
The survey. of some 182,370 students, revealed.

an inadequate candidate, and in future elections,
says Karpatkin. the DSA will “spill some blood if
necessary" in finding new leaders which are to the
DSA’s satisfaction. ~

~ The terms Democrat and Socialist are redundant,
said Karpatkln. adding that “democracy is what
Democratic Socialism Is all about."'The members
of DSA are socialists said Karpatkln. because they
want Democracy to include economic life. as well as
politics.

There was never- any “Golden Age" of
liberalism. said Karpatkln, pointing to George
McOovem's candidacy In' 1972.

McGovern, supposedly the champion of the
students and liberalism received only about 45 per-
cent of the votes, while his opponent, Richard Nix-
on received about 55 percent. Karpatlrin compared
these figures to this part election. and lmisted that

ministrators to circumvent
faculty and students within the
governance process in order to
impose their own agenda on the
University." SASU recom-
mends. he said. that students be
given the ability to determine
policy surrounding ad-
ministrative fees which can raise
tuition costs. These fees are
presently determined by the in-
dividual campus president.
According to Siegel, even
after the University’s budget has
been allocated by the governor.
the University has to justify its
programs and expenditures to
state ofﬁcials and have them ap-

dividuals" to the SUNY system.
Siegel said he thought
Reagan's policies were "a bad
example of government by anec-
dote" and that “officials offer
irrelevant tales to justify their
programs." He said the budget
cuts "showed a lack of
understanding of the vision of
equality of education in
America and its role in main-

taining a classless society."
According to Siegel. the cuts
which would be most harmful
were ones planned for the Pell
Grant program and in federal
loans. Siegel claimed that the
