Test anxiety can be both a
physical reaction ‘— such‘ as a
rapid heart beat, sweaty palms
and shakin'ess: and a cognitive
reaction such as negative ideas
about oneself or about one’s test
performance. Both can affect per—

night for the MeinorialS'erVice of
popular SUNYA student Renita
Yolanda Wright.

"Nita." as she was affec-

the Bronx. to. attend Nita's

"funeral procession at McCall’s

Funeral Home. Hosts of students
made the trip. Two vans and three
car loads full of grieving students
trekked their way to the Bronx for

this very unhappy occasion. As I
one student so fittineg assertedi

“too bad we had to come to the‘
city together for Nita’s funeral
and not for something else."

When news of Nita's death was
received, two Fridays ago. a wave
of shockshot acrossAlbany cam-
pus. transcending feelings from
disbelief to unharnessed..anger,
such as exhibited by junior
Lehman Yates — a close friend of
the deceased -— who received 10
stitches in his knee cap after a
very unamiable encounter with a
class window.

Students, at the memorial ser-
vice. grieved openly and vocally
throughout. many of them, on
numerous occaiions, bursting in-
to tears and hastily exiting.

A team of speakers came to
commemorate Renita's short but
tragic life. eloquently extolling
endearing and gracious praise on
her. included among them was
her guidance counselor Virginia
Rifferenbeck who used words
such as "highly principled" and
“vivacious” to describe Nita.

But i think Yusuf Green summu
ed up Nita's tragic plight best
when he stated that "somewhere
in the beginning, ou‘r happiness

illusion we call life." in essence.

fortunate ones. Nita has “found”

it may also be helpful to men-
tally visualize the 'test taking
situation and to practice testing
yourself at home. if your exam
will take place in a room you are
unfamiliar with, locate the room

'prior to the exam. find a seat and

try to imagine your upcoming ex-
am taking place there. This
rehearsal will make the actual ex-
am more familiar and will help
you to relax and handle the exam
with confidence.

The cOgnitive reactions of test
anxiety are made up of negative
thoughts and ideas of one’s per—
formance prior to and/or during
an exam. These negatiVe thoughts

and ideas will affect one‘s perfor-
mance by channeling concentra-
tion and energy away from the ex-
am. 'Don't concentrate on poor
preparation or performance. in-
stead, offer praise and
reassurance to yourself. Thoughts
of poor performance or lack of
preparation will only cause added.
anxiety. Try to become aware of

these distractions as. they occur

‘and use a relaxation technique

which you have found to be
useful. a ‘ . .

Consider your personal views
on test-taking. Do you consider
each test a'measure of your self—
‘worth? if so, you are placing un-
due pressure on yourself and this
type of pressure will only serve to
exaggerate. the importance of
tests. it is important to realize
that your performance on a test is
not a direct reﬂection on you as a
person.. ' I r ,
