Pogue said. "Heineken remov-
ed from hisltA position and has
been arrested by the,University
Police Department.”- He also said ‘
that Geraci will appear in Police _
Court sometime in the near '
future. '
“in addition to losing his job as
an RA he has .also been referred
through our (the .University)
judicial system and is pending a
hearing now," said Pogue. He
added that it is not unusual to
delay' process pending the arrest
outcome. r,
' Pogue said. “We have no real '
indication why he‘did it. it is
something he probably has asked
himself a thousand times."
Pogue explained that they have
takn a special interest in this case
because. “we had every indica-
tion that the RA was a reliable
person who showed committment
{to being an RA." Pogue describ-

_ evening that he could not get his

bus repaired." said Rich Wilson.
“The day driver found the bus in
good condition, but the night
driver had problems with the
lights and heater; neither worked
well at all and he could not get
them repaired, or checked."
Another major complaint made
by students is “the ridiculous bus
ticket system.” said Gawlcy.
“The booths are never open when
you need them. The I.O.U.
system is made out for the conve-
nience of the drivers." According
to Beidl, one needs simply go to
Securityto pick up an 1.0.U. if

I one cannot get a ticket.

Students stranded downtown
without a ticket or sticker
however are not helped by this
system. Linda' Cronin. -a
sophomore who lives on Dutch
Quad said she was almost strand-
ed downtown last Saturday night
after she visited a friend off cam-
pus and realized that she lost her
return ticket. "Calls to Security
did not help. They said there was
nothing they could do." said
Cronin. “I had to ask strangers
for a bus ticket so that I could
return=uptown at a reasonable
hour."

Dalton also asserted that “as
paying customers. we should have
more say in the service. There are
not enough buses at appropriate
times. In the mornings downtown
it takes up to 45 minutes to catch
a bus to class. There should be
more buses at appropriate times
to pick up the surplus students. A
student picking up a bus at Allen
and Western. for example, does

out of the lecture ccnters.“You

.Landis said.

Robert Pipia. president ' of
University Action for the Disabl-
ed (UAD), stressed how impossi-
ble it is to get indoors unassisted
if a building is not equipped with-
automatlcally operated
doora.“Sometimes you can wait
around for fifteen minutes before
someone comes along to open a
door for you." he said.

Pipia estimated that it costs
31.000 to install electrically
operated doors.

Sayour. however. said he saw
the electronic doors as a
wuste.“As far as I'm concern-
ed.the $1,000 Was wasted...there

problems

not have a fighting chance to get
on the bus unless they are out very
early. The average student who
lives downtown commutes 80
minutes per day, including time
wasted waiting for a bus.”

“There must be a lack of com-.

munication between students and
us,"_ said An Burt. uTransporta-
tion Supervisor. I‘l devised this
year's bus schedule in accordance
with the class schedule and have
yet to hear a complaint. If there
are complaints, I’d like to know. I

think we have a very good'

system.”

“Also, it's a bunch of crap that
our buses aren’t safe." said Burt.
“For example, the loud breaks
people hear are ﬁne: they’re loud
because of the hard.linings. Even
though there are one or two buses
out of service; we do our best to
keep the buses in good condition.

and we use a mini-bus so that the

schedules are not screwed up."
The oldest bus was built in 1975.
the newest in 1984. The Universi-
ty has 16 buses in its ﬂeet.

A ﬁnal complaint is that
students are not quite sure how
the revenues from the bus system
are being spent. “I think they are
using the bus fee system to
perpetuate their own bureaucracy
and justify their jobs.” com-
mented Audrey Fischer. Neither
Stevens nor Beidl could be reach-
ed for comment on how the
revenue is used.

The three groups will be conti-
nuing the survey through the'
weekend and expect to have ﬁnal

results by Wednesday of next "

The Speaker’s Bureau was formed in
response to an ignorant homophobic
climate atSUNYA. The rationale behind
the concept was that much of the hatred of
an violence toward gays and lesbians could
be prevented by talking to the very people
who could‘possibly be‘a‘ threat. Certainly it

out there wants to‘physically injure a‘gay

, _ian'othero‘f- they tensions between gays and

straights can :be relieved. One of the’di'ivg.

ing forces ofvhomophobia is the fear on they.- '-

part ofa straightperson that they might be

vehemently Ind-homosexual;
But these fears are based on stereotypes

. of whatjitmt'eans to be gay and what it

meansto be straight. Both gay and straight

peoplehave'elements of both‘sexualities in r

their personality..The Kinsey study. one of
the'most thorough studies on the topic of
homosexuality, redeﬁnes our concept of
two sexualities. Kinsey found that in fact
only, 10 percent of the population was
strictly gay or lesbian and only 10 percent
strictly heterosexual. The rest fell
somewhere in between. The social stresses .
that force gay people to conform to the so-
called heterosexual norm then also force
heterosexuals to cut off parts of their ex-
periences and behaviors. We all lose when
it comes to unthinking acceptance of
stereotypes. . '

It is by no means easy to challenge much
that we have all learned. It certainly isn’t
socially acceptable in many circles to have
a lesbian or gay friend or family member.
it is Speaker’s Bureau's hope that its
panelists can provide _the information and
support - that ' might r not "be‘ immediately 1

to organizations and classes the panelists
are able to make the need for understan'f
