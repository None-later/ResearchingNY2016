“Women, children, and _old-

the El Salvadoran countryside,

Arcc, a'SaIvadoran refugee. Arcc
ﬂed El Salvador five years ago
and sought political sanctuary in
Mexico. He was unable to seek
asylum from the United States
because it» does no recognize
political refugees from Central
America. ~  . _ r -
According to Arcc, President
Dusrtc, who heads ,the
Salvadoran “right-wing" govern-
ment, is a puppet of the United
States. “(Duartc) does what the
United States tells him to do," he
maintained. - ‘-
Of the ﬁve million people in‘El
Salvador, 55,000 have been killed
, or have disappeared under the
Duane regime, said Arcc. adding
“The majority of people are
women and children. The men
are dead.” ' _
Protesting students are fre-
‘quently attacked by the- Duane
regime,.said Arcc, who told a
story of a couple who we..- cap-

nude body was: found on a corin-

the doctor discovered the head of
