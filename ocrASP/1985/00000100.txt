A ~ After numerous days of  and

competing. the Albany State women's
swim team's season has come to a close._
The SUNYAC championships held
February 22 and 23 at SUNY Oswego
marked the end to an» 8-6 season for the

'First year Head Coach 'Davc‘Turn‘age'
said. "Although the. team placed 7th, it
was not as well as '1 would have liked.
However. with. hard. work ‘and good
recruiting. we should do well next year. I
think mainly the season was a learning
one; they had to get to know' me and I had
to get to know them." ' " ‘
. However. there were many good perfor-
mances by the__Lady Dane swimmers. The
top twelve swimmers in each race scored.

the Cortland game. they played a box and
one on her. I didn't know why. but I
ﬁgured we'd better." .

Rebounding was a major factor in this
ball game. Albany was led by Lori Bayba
and Patterson with seven rebounds each.
Normally. Cindy Jensen and Kim Kosalek
are up there too. Buffalo State had
another strong rebounder in Karen
O'Callaghan. who had 9 rebounds.

“We were lntimidated because some of
our players were getting so beat up.” said
Patterson. “They didn‘t even have the
strength to get them after being thrown
around. It was tough to get in there. They
would push you before. It was so physical.
some of the players couldn’t handle it."'

Playing a tougher. more physical game
the day before may have helped the
Bengals in the ﬁnals. "We worked real
hard on rebounding for the Cortland
game," said Buffalo State coach Gail
Maloney. “I think it carried over into
tonight’s game.” -

Other \than rebounding. things were
pretty even between the two teams. The
Danes scored more off the floor, but the
Bengals sank 26 out of 31 free throws.
Albany only had 14 points from foul
shooting. Both teams shot low from the
floor. V

"It was the kind of game in which we

,don’t play inc-ll).I said ,Warncr. ‘.'It was a
physical. but of control ball game. We

Coach Turnage also mentioned the
club’s supportersz. “I would like to thank
the four gentlemen who attended all of the
home meets and travelled with the team to
Cortland. Loyal fans like that are greatly
appreciated by the coach and team." [I]

handled it better than us."

Both Maloncy and Warner plan to com-
plain about the officiating. “The of-
ﬁciating was consistentl: poor for both
teams." said Warner. “Those were two of
the worst ofﬁcials I’ve had in the last 2
years. For a SUNYAC Championship that
shouldn’t be allowed to happen.”

“Discipline won the ball game for us,"
said Maloney. "I've been criticized in the
past for not having disciplined players. At
halftime I told- them to concentrate and be
disciplined. Our offensive execution,
especially when we have the lead, was con-
trolled. That was the key to winning it.
Had we taken bad shots it could have put
ourselves right out of the situation.”

Leading Buffalo State was Timm with
20 points. O'Callaghan followed with l8.
l0 of which were in the ﬁrst half. For their
performances. they were both named to
the All-Tournament team. Lorraine Lynch
was close behind with l6 points. The night
before. she had 27 points. Lynch was the
tournament MVP.

“That’s the most production I’ve had
out of Jane for the season." said Maloney.
“Karen is as tough as nails. She's strong
both physically and mentally. She plays 40
minutes and doesn’t stop."

For the Danes. both Lesane and Patter-
son contributed l6 points each. They were

,both named to the All-Tournament team.
