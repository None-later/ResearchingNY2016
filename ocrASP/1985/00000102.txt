The Albany State Great Danes
will be going to the NCAA Divi-
sion Iii Tournament for the first
time since 1981 despite losing the
SUNYAC championship game,
73-64, to the Buffalo State
Bengals.

The Danes will be competing in
the New England regionals after
being one of two teams in the na-
tion swung out of their own divi-
sion. The tournament opens Fri-
day night in Worcester. Mass.
with Clark facing Westfield State.
Albany plays host to Worcester
Polytechnic institute (17-7) in the
late game Friday night.

Two other SUNYAC teams
made the NCAAs; Buffalo State.
the SUNYAC champs, and
Potsdam State. They will be com-
peting in the North East Regional
and will be joined by Hartwick
and the winner of a playoff bet-
ween Alfred and St. Lawrence.

interestingly enough, should
the Danes win the New England
Regional. they will host the win-
ncr of the North East Regional in
the quarterfinals on March 9.

Buffalo State won the
SUNYAC championship for the
second consecutive year as a
result of a solid all-around perfor-

mance in their defeat of Albany
Saturday night.

The Bengals took control early,
scoring the first seven points of
the game, and extending their
lead to as much as 12 points mid-
way through the first haif, before

The home court advantage held out for
eleven consecutive games for the Albany
State women‘s basketball team. it was in
their 12th game during the SUNYAC
finals that the Danes tasted defeat for the
very first time this season in their own
University Gym.

esane first Albany woman to reach 1000

Going into the fix-ais of the SUNYAC tournament. Rainny Lesanc needed nine
points to reach the MOO career point plateau piayirtg for the Danes. That point would
make her the only \roman in Dane history to achieve this.

After having been fouled by Lorraine Lynch. Lesane stepped to the free throw line
with 18:28 rcmaini: g in the second half. She sank the shot. an announcement was
made. and Lcsane was presented with a bail and flowers.

“When i heard the announcement i wanted to run out on the court and congratulate
her. but i didn‘t want my team to get a tech.” said Lorraine Lynch of Buffalo State.

Lesane now holds the all-time leading scorer record at 1007 points after Saturday
night’s game. For a junior, that’s quite an accomplishment. She also holds the highest
single season record. Lcsanc is ranked sixth in field goal percentage shooting in the na-
tion. Last week’s statistics had her shooting 58 percent from the ﬂoor.

“it was nice that we were able to stop the game and give her the ball and flowers in

Lesanc knew she was close. but wasn't sure how many points she needed. ironically,
she ended the half with eight points. just one point shy of the record. When she found
out it was nine at half time, she had lost track of how many she had scored and still
wasn’t sure when the ninth point would come.

in Saturday's final. the Danes, who beat
Buffalo University 7i-58 to enter the
finals, never captured the lead over the
Buffalo State Bengals, who defeated Cor-
tland 59-51 in the initial round. With 4:30
left in the game. the Bengals had a 14 point
lead. The Danes, sparked by 7 points by
Rainny Lesnne. were able to pull within
seven points with a little over one minute
remaining.

The championship was still within sight
for the Danes. in the ﬁnal minute, Buffalo
State missed six consecutive free throws.

“in the last stretch we couldn’t convert
down at the other end." said Albany's
coach Mari Warner. “They were missing
the foul shots but we were getting tied up
in rebounds or jump bails. it hurt us not to
convert at the other end." .

"We didn't give up and we kept hanging
in there and hanging in there." said Patter-
son. “At the end we just couldn’t

convert."

The Bengals were ahead. 33-28 at
halftime. Jane Timm scored ten of their
first 22 points and had 14 points with 7 re-
bounds at the end of the half. Tlmm was a
very big factor in the win for Buffalo
State. The Bengals out-rebounded the
Danes 50-38. Timm led with is rebounds.

“A big part' of it was the rebounding,"
said Warner. "Timm needed to be con-
tained. We played a box and one on her. in
