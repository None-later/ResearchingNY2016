 to Greek'life ’s attractions

By Patrice Johnson

Many minorities are turning
to sororities and fraternities to
enhance the quality of their
lives. This SUNY campus is
once again becoming a strong
solid foundation from Greek
organizations. As more minori-
ty soroities
m... m... Beyond
nies make‘ a.
SUNYA their
h o m e . Majority
students are
becoming attr‘acted to the
rewards that these organiza-
tions offer whether they are

 

 

"social, educational or spiritual.

1985 is the year in which

',more :fraternities thave become

active and reinstated concern-
ing minorities. Phi BetaSigma
fraternity is oneof the frater-
nies prevalent on this campus.
its goal is to search for “men
of quality rather than of quan-
tity." as often stated by one or
.ts members. Charles Rogers.
Another fraternitythat has
maintained an active chapter
on this campus for several
years is Kappa Alpha Psi
fraternity. This minoritiy
fraternity encourages ex-
cellence and simultaneously
serves as a boost for men in
various aspects of their lives.
Kappa Alpha Psi will be pledg-
ing a new linve consisting of t
eight men in the near future.

The other” fraternity for

minorities on campus is Omega ‘

Psi Phi fraternity. Omega Psi
Phi has jut started another
undergraduate line consisting

of seven pledges. This fraterni-

' ty seeks to enrich the lives of its
members while furishing ser-
vices to_ the community and
world at large. All of these
fraternities strive for similar
goals while serving society in
various ways via many pro-
grams; donations and drives.

Minority sororities also have
goals that resemble those of
fraternities because their major
goal is to serve others while ex-
erting a generous amount of
energry into elevating one's
own inner qualities. Alpha
Kappa Alpha Sorority is one
sorority existing for minority
women on a predominantly
white campus. Delta Sigma
Theta sorority has reinstated a
chapter at SUNYA consisting
of fifteen woemn who have just
become full members.

Both sororities serve to
educate the minds of in-
dividuals in society and to help
meet the needs of those who

are underpriviledged or in some
way deprived during the course
of their lives.

Minority serorities and

fraternities serve tohelp us feel'

good about ourselves while
capitalizing on our ‘strenghts
and transforming our
weaknesses into strenghts.
Minorities. are encouraged to
involve themselves in external
affairs that seek to build
positively within. Morality and

character are positively guided.

and encouraged with the fer-
vent hope that the members of
these greek organizations will
become towers of ability,
strength. and compassion.

Not only have academic.
spiritual. and extra-curricular
activities been emphasized
within these 'orgunlzations'
structure. but brotherhood and
sisterhood is mandated. Many
students desire to become a
part of a fraternity or sorority
for their long journey in search

for brotherhood or sisterhood.

-The bonds that result from

becoming a part of a greek
organization are close to
miraculous. but they are real in
every literal connotation of the

(word. in this light. sororities

and fraternties function to br-
ing minorities together and
make them a whole instead of
an individual.

in short, the plusses of
minority sororities and frater-
nities outweigh the myths and
distorted conceptions often
associated with these organiza-
tions. Alpha Kappa Alpha,
Delta Sigma Theta. Kappa
Alpha Psi. Omega Psi Phi. and
Phi Beta Sigma you are saluted
for your quality of service to
mankind and your own distlndt
and forceful way in which you
have sought to keep us
together. And this unity -—
meeting of mind. body, and
soul simultaneously is for
keeps.
