The Albany State Women's gymnastic
team battled it out to the end‘wlth the
University of Vermont, a Division l
school. 'Wednesday, only to be defeated
by.85. Despite their narrow loss, the Danes

obtained their second highest score of the.

season. a l52.l$.
This was an outstanding meet for the

Dane gymnasts. They were strong in all 5

four events, putting up a tough fight
against Vermont. ' ’
it was a good day on the vault for the
Danes. Sue Leskowitz grabbed first place
with a handspring vault, earning an 8.!5.
Nora Bellatoni set the new season record

on the uneven bars as she took first place‘
with an 8.25. She “hit” her two beat fulls, I

uprise, and a beautiful hecht full
dismount. '

Michelle Husak tied for second on the
balance beam with a score of 8.5, setting a
school record. She held a reverse planche.
and executed a back walk over. back hand-
spring, and a gainer back tuck dismount.
Husak, who usually takes first in the floor
exercise, was 'surprised with her
performance. A

“i worked hard on this routine hoping it
would bring up my score," said Husak,
“and although i was surprised, it felt
great."

The' floor exercise was the team's
strongest event of the night, the team scor-
ing their highest totai of the season, a
40.45. With a mark of 8.45, Husak cap~
tured first place. Her routine was one of
strong tumbling and clean execution.

Gym. The ECACs will include the top six
teams in the east. five university‘teams'and
one team of individual all-arounds, 'and
two event specialists per event.‘

To qualify for the ECACs, the team’s
three top scores are averaged —- the top
home meet, the top away meet and the
next highest which can be either home or
away. it looks very promising for theDane
gymnasts as their top three scores are l52.3
against Salem, 152.l5 against UVM, and
150.75 vs. LlU. The team must qualify for
the regionuls in the same way. but the task
will not be easy. Since the rcglonals are be
ing held at a Division ll level, the Danes
must not only beat out Division lliteams
but Division ll teams as well. ‘ Cl

RPl’s record is'l3-7, having won ten of
their last ll games. They were on a nine-
game winning streak until losing to the
Danes in the Capital District Tournament.
RPl coach Chris Pritchard feels her team
got into the ECACs due to their momen-
tum during the last half of the season.

The Engineers lost to Albany by 20

‘ points early in the season and came back a
mu'ch-improved squad in the CD tourna-
ment to lose by ﬁve points in the ﬁnals.

“There is a healthy rivalry between the
two teams.” said Pritchard. “Both teams
play really hard when we meet. Some
rivalries are out of bitterness. but this one
is very healthy."

The RPl starters show the team’s well
roundedness. Center Tess Swatt, a
sophomore, is the team’s leading scorer
and rebounder with 14.9 ppg and 15 re-
bounds per game. Colleen Greany
averages [0.7 ppg and leads the team in

. steals. As a senior she is the all-time
leading scorer for both men and women at
RPI. MaryLou Murrock averages 13 ppg

' at the guard position. The team‘s point
guard, Lori Hendler averages 5.7 assists
per game. A nine-point contributor is Lori
Wetherbee.

Rﬂ considers height its strength over
Nazareth, as the Engineers have two six-
foot‘tall players. Another strong point is
their well balanced scoring attack; which
doesn’t allow an opponent to isolate on an
RPl scorer.

After a win over Skidmore last Tuesday,

- the Engineers have had ,a week off and
,consider that time a drawback for this
tournament. Their major weakness is a
-lackofspeed.' ‘ ‘ v 1‘ .A

SUNYAC champions Buffalo State by
seven points in January. '

Nazareth starts three guards in their
line-up, which may explain their quickness
as a team. Point guard Denise Hickey
from Troy averages eight ppg and ﬁve re-
bounds. Chris Smith contributes eight ppg
and Lori Welge, two ppg. Heidi Higgins
sinks i3 ppg with nine rebounds on the
average. Leading scorer. Jean Rasey,
averages 16 ppg and six rebounds.

Coach Mike DeSillis of Nazareth con-
siders his teams weakness their consisten-
cy. “Our biggest problem has been that
we've played very well for only minutes in
a ball game. We haven't put too many full
games together. We've had problems stay-
ing up for an entire ball game," said
DeSillis.

He feels his teams' strength is their
whole team effort coupled with hustle and
a good attitude. They really haven't been
blown out by anyone except St. Boneven-
ture, a Div. II school, whom they lost to by
ll points (86-75). Five of their losses have
been at the buzzer or in overtime.

“l’ve never seen either team play," said
DeSillis. “it'll be more or less watching
them the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes or so. There is a
disadvantage playing a team you know
nothing about."
