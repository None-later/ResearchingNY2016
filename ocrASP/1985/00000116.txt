Albany Symphonythrives

Question: What institution. in
downtown Albany has recently been get-
ting national recognition? Answer: if you
guessed the State Capitol, you're wrong.
it's the Albany Symphony Orchestra.

Stacey Kern

Recently, the Albany Symphony Or-
chestra received front page coverage in
The Wall Street journal for its unique and
successful policy of giving American music
preferential treatment over standard Euro-
pean repertoire. A typical concert at the
Albany Symphony features at least one
work by a popular composer, such as
Mozart, ’lwthoven, Ravel, Tchaikovsky,
etc., and twv a four selections of works by
American composers. Statistics show that
only six percent of the music played by
major U.5. orchestras today has been writ-
ten by Americans and to many this type of
programming is radical. However. ticket
sales are up ten percent at the Albany Sym-
phony, and Time Magazine recently gave
their new album a favorable review.

The Albany Symphony Orchestra,
which was established in 1930 as the Pen-
ple‘s Symphony of Albany, is .1 part-time
orchestra which draws from various musi-
cians in the community, including
members of the SUNYA faculty. in 1977,
when the orchestra was having financial
difficulics, local businessman Peter Ker-
"11"“ took over as board president and In-
itiated the present programming policy. in
an cffort to gum-rate more cnthuslam and
understantling in the community,

 

 

 

 

Vanguard Prevues were started. On the
Thursday before a concert, guest artists
and composers discuss the upcoming

‘ works and give a short previewnat the

Albany Public Library. )

Another goal of the Albany Symphony
Orchestra is to increase concert attendance
by students. Students can purchase half-
priced tickets one hour before the concert.
and seats are practically guaranteed. For
SUNYA students, the Symphony’s move
to The Palace Theater is particularly conve-
nient since the Wellington bus stops two
blocks away.

This weekend, March I and 2, the pro-
gram will be Concerto for Piano and Or-
cheslra, N0. 3 in d minor, Opus 30 by

 

Rachmanioff,‘Symphony No. 2, Opus 30,
"Romantic" by Howard Hanson, Pulitzer
Prize winner and former director of: the

Eastman School of Music, and Prospect:"
11.983, 4 described ~ by, :com'pbser ‘ Hugo
V Weisgall as "fohnally free, totally abstract,

yet completely of a piece."-

‘ The guest artist is pianist Steven Mayer,

a winner 'of many international competi-
tions and has been described as “one of the
major piahists of his generation."

The Albany Symphony Orchestra per-
forms the same concert at Troy Music Hall
on Fridays and at The Palace Theater on
Saturdays. Concert time is at 8 p.m. For

further information, call the Albany Sym-
U E

phony at 465-4663.

As for the shrewdness' fo this" unex-

alone, it won't be new territory for him. ~—
That’s right folks, Mick himself has said
that it doesn't look like there will be a Roll-
ing Stones when its members are all in their
fifties.

On his own, Mick Jagger could finally
allow the natural physical and
psychological processes associated with ag-
ing to manifest themselves in, and perhaps
even contribute to his music. Although
Mick is far from acting his age on She’s the
Boss, at least this album is laying the
groundwork for a future that won‘t include
hollering and leaping for fans young
enough to be his grandchildren.

For the moment, though, there is little
need to be concerned about the future of
the Rolling Stones. There are no bad vibes
with the group concerning She’s the Boss
or the follow-up album Mick is now plann-
ing. As i mentioned before, this move has
no deep significance. The Stones are
