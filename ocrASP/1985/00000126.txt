First year and transfer
students hoping to gain admis-
sion toSUNYA's Business
School this fall will need to
have a slightly higher Adjusted
Grade Point Average (AGPA)
according to Business School
Dean Harvey Kahalas.

The change is a result of an
enrollment quota set by
University President Vincent
O’Leary. "To keep enrollment
in the Business School at the
level it should be. we had to
have this slight alteration."
Kahalas said.

At the present time. the
AGPA for Business School ap-
plicants is a 3.038 for students
who have taken all their core
classes at SUNYA and a 3.163,
3.347. or a 3.408 for transfer
students. depending on how
many core classes they have
taken at SUNYA.

These figures have been rais-
ed for Fall ‘85 applicants to a
3.055 for students who took all
core courses at SUNYA and a
3.3. 3.4. or 3.5 for transfer
students.

Kahalas explained that the
quota for Business School ma-
jors is 800 students and for the
past several years they have
been admitting up to 880
students. “To keep the quality

 

School of Business to
“up standards slightly

of the school. we muSt limit
enrollment." he said.

Leonard Lapinski. Associate
Dean of Undergraduate
Studies. explained that the
AGPA is a “sliding thing" that
changes with the numberof ap-
plicants. He said. “the AGPA
can change from semester to
semester according to the
quota."

The quota for the Business
School varies according to fun-
ding. and according to
Kahalas. money is an Indirect
cause for the raising of the
AGPA. "if we could get addi-
tional funding we could hire
more staff and accept more
students," he said.

However according to Coor-
dinator of Advisement Services
and Assistant Dean of CUE,
Dick Collier, “the slight raise
will not have much of an effect
on the students." He explained
that students with straight B
averages never got into the
Business School in the past. He
added. “transfer students only
make up a small percentage of
the population so their increase
will not have a big effect on
them either."

Collier also explained that
students could reapply in the
spring ifthey missed the AGPA
by a small amount. [’7

three bills recently introduced into the
legisture become law.
Two of the bills have been introduced in
the Assembly by Deputy Speaker Arthur
Eve (D. Buffalo) and Assembly member
Herman Farrell (D, NTC). while the third
bill has been sponsored in the Senate by
Leon Bogues (D, NYC). according to Jerry
Lee. Counsel to'Eve.
' Pulling investments of companies that
'do business in South Africa. commonly
‘ known as divestiture. is a tactic advocated
‘ by "many people to bring an end to that
country's political system of apartheid. _,
Four and a half million whites‘control
almost the entire country's resources and
the lives, of the 26 million blacks living in
South Africa, said Bojana Jordan. Presl-
dentof American-South African Peoples’
Friendship Association during SASU’s
Legislative Conference In Albany last
week. ,
“Blacks may not hold national ofﬁces
or choose their education.’ in South
Africa, Jordan stated.

Evc.‘ commenting 0n the apartheid

' policy of South Africa, said. “the quicker v

we deal with it the less likely we’ll have
massive violence” in the country."

The bills. if pasted. will restrict the
deposit of certain pension fund moneys in
banking organizations which lead money
to the Republic of South Africa. and will
also prohibit the Investment of common
.Retirement Pension Funds In the stocks or
securities of companies or corporations
doing business in or with the Republic of
South Africa.

Their object is to refocus state Invest-
,ment practices such that moral leadership
will result and the investment shift will
foster New York State economic develop-
ment. with each bill working toward Its
particular goal according to a New York
State Assembly Memorandum.

According toWray. there are three
SUNY groups dealing with devestment In

The issue will be studied by these groups

and recommendations will be referred to.

the SUNY Board of Trustees on April 24.
. “if SUNY divests. it's p‘lttting pressure
on (the rest of) New York State." said
Wray. adding that “students educating
other students is what Is important In deal-
ing with this problem. We do not support
the (South African) oppression." she
asserted.

SUNY Chancellor Clifton Wharton sup-
ports a complete pullout of U.S. corpora.
tlon funds from South Africa. according
to Eveline ‘MacDougull. SASU com-
munications Director.

According to a SASU report on South
Africa. SUNY has I5 million invested In
companies which have dealings In South
Africa. '

But. although Wharton supports the
pullout. "i don’t think he’ll play a large
role in the decision of the Board' of
Trustees." said Wray. “I think he'll just
lay back and go with whatever the Board
decides." she added.

According to Lee. March 19 will be,

Divestment Day. when churches and other
organizations will be lobbying against
public investments in South Africa. He
also stated that there is a possibility that

the bills will go to the floor _of the
Assembly during that week.’

When asked what he feels the chances of
each bill or all the bills being passed, he
replied, “support in the assembly is good
(but support in the) senate is fair."

Assemblyman. Richard J. Connors (D-
Albany). when questioned about his view
on divestment. replied. “I'm for it."

Andrew Chin. a SASU intern. said
“students across the country are recogniz-
ing the struggles of the black people in

South Africa.” adding. “SASU feels that
it's time for SUNY to divest." According
to Chin. April 16 will be a SASU statewide
lobby day when SUNY schools and other
interest groups will come to Albany to lob-
by for divestiture from South Africa.
Eric Bowman. Student Association
Minority Affairs Coordinator. said “it's a
shame that (the) SUNY system is using
students“ and tax payers‘ money to oppress
the black- people." Jordan commented.
