Though her case may not be
typical. college placement of-
ficials across the country report
that the number of firms looking
to hire liberal arts grads is up
substantially over last year.
“Even major corporations are
now giving an increasingly sincere
look at liberal arts graduates.”
reports Victor Lindquist, who
directs Northwestern University’s
career placement center and is the
author of an annual report track—
ing job offers nationwide.
Lindquist says the increasing
interest in liberal arts graduates is
part of a trend that began in
about 1980.
Liberal arts grads “tend to
have marketable communication
skills. both written and oral.

‘analytical tools. and tend to be

more trainable." he explains.
Small businesses are also hiring
more this year. and are more
receptive to liberal arts grads than
to grads with technical or
specialized degrees. who demand

valuable skills." Judith Kaysei' of
the College Placement Council
says. ‘

"But with a mom and pop
operation. it's easier to get the
time to sell yourself."

if the trend in favor of liberal
arts grads is reaching new highs. it

‘ could mean the end of what Some

administrators, have dubbed the
“taxi-driver syndrome:" the spec~
tre of bright, overquaiified
humanities graduates who drive
taxis while waiting for “mean—
ingful’ jobs that never
materialize.

But others say the increase in
job offers for' liberal arts
graduates is no larger than for
graduates in other disciplines.

“l'd like to bélieve that
employers have come around to
the advantages of liberal arts
graduates." says Gary McGrath.
the career development director
for liberal arts majors at the
University of Minnesota. “But
that's not the case."

McGrath says an improved
economy is the reason more
employers are interested in liberal
arts grads.

“When the economy improves.
employers are willing to look at a
more diverse group of ap-
plicants." he says.

The College Placement Coun-
cil's annual survey of major cor-
porations indicates business ex-
ecutives plan to hire eight percent
more grads this year than last.

Other surveys. however. sug- '

gest that liberal arts majors will

Donald Hester. director of the

there is some validity in that argu-

ment. He said he considers the.

ideal education to include an

Van Soest agreed with Hester in
that certain fields of business re-_
quire more specialized
knowledge. He said that. “it
depends on the company. and the
kind of position. There are some
positions such as management
and sales. that don’t need a

successful. there are also some

National statistics on child sex-
ual abuse claim that a girl baby

ually abused before her l8th bir-
thday. while a" boy baby's risk is
one in eight. These figures reflect
only reported cases of child sexual
abuse. it is estimated that two-.
thirds of incidents of abuse are
never reported. Why is child sex-
ual abuse so widespread when it is
supposed to be taboo in our
culture?

Child sexual abuse has existed
for centuries. According to the
Albany County Rape Crisis
Center. “Child seXuai abuse is

it is the horor and the myths
regarding child sexual abuse that
make it so complex an issue. The
horror makes us tempted to look
away. The myths succeed in pro.
tecting and excusing the offender.
while simultaneously ignOring

"and damaging the victim. Patti.

like so many other victims. was
unable to speak up at the .time of
her abuse. it would be helpful
here to openly state someof the
existing myths and to challenge
them with facts. " .

Myth: Child sexual abuse rarely
happens.

Fact: The FBl;s UnifOrm Crime
Report (l98l) states that a child is
sexually abuse every 2 miunutes in
this country. in l984. the Albany
Rape Crisis Center had 9i
reported cases of sexual assault by
a live-in non-relative. What
makes this type of sexual abuse
seem so rare is not the lack of oc-
currance. Rather it is the silence
surrounding the issue. as well as a
historical lack of support systems
for the vicims who dared to speak

Fact: Jo Ann C. Beasley’s 1984
article entitled. "Basic Facts of
Child Sexual Abuse" tells us that
in 85 percent of the cases of
reported abuse. the offender is so-
meone the child knows and trusts.
such as a father. uncle. babysit-
ter. or neighbort. ‘

Myth: Physical force almost
always accompanies the sexual
abuse. ‘

Fact: While physical force is
sometimes a factor. the majority
of incidents involve the emotional
coercion of the child. Because the
offender is someone the child
knows and trusts. it is easy for the
adult to twist the child's naive
need for love and affection. This
is often done with th rcats. bribes.
or tricks.

Myth: Sexual abuse involves in—
tercourse and happens only once.
Fact: Sexual contact is ac-
complished in a variety of ways.
Often. because of the proximity
of the offender and the power of
his position of trust over the
child. the abuse extends over a

Fact: This myth is perhaps the
most damaging to the Victim of
child sexual abuse. The trauma of
not being believed. and/or being
held responsible for the abusive
treatment is often permanently
damaging. The Albany Rape
Crisis Center stresses. “Children
do not invent stories about their
own abuse. The offender is
always responsible for his actions.
Child sexual abuse is never the
victim's fault." ,

There are some other facts
regarding child sexual abuse. The
overwhelming majority of the of-
fenders are male. (Estimates
range from 90-97 percent.) The
majority of offenses are
heterosexual in nature. and the
average age of the victim is
eleven. These facts are frightening
and the extent of the abuse must
be acknowledged before the pro-
blem can be confronted.

It is due to the dedicated work
of concerned groups and agencies
that the victims of child sexual
abuse are 'finally being encourag-
ed in open and healthy ways to
