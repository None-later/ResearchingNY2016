By Patrch J. Paul

Vestiges of a 3.000 year old city
on Cyprus, which is probably
evidence of the ﬁrst trade link,
between Athens and the Mediter-
ranean island. have been
discovered by a university
Classics professor.

According to Paul Wallace,
who made the'discovery after a
month of intensive surveying and
excavation last summer, the ﬁnd
'will help to more precisely deter-
mine when the mainland Greeks
ﬁrst came to the island bringing
their language. technology. myths
and culture in return for copper.

Wallace described his work as.
“An attempt to reconstruct _
aspects of earlier cultures by ex.
amining the physical remains.’.'
This Bronze Age revelation. ac-~
cording to Wallace. is the most
signiﬁcant of the IO to IS towns,
which he has discovered in over‘
two decades of exploration in the

‘Mediterranean basin.

Marion, a site from the late
Bronze Age which covers the
period from 1400 to 1100 B.C.,
eventually transformed into the
center of classical art for Cyprus,
said Wallace. This area in nor-
thwest Cyprus has generated
some of the most aesthetic
classical art of its kind, including
the best red-and-black-ﬁgured
pottery, he asserted. Because art
is the only real substance that can
be. salvaged from the site. he
classiﬁed the discovery, as a
“scholarly contribution,”
primarily concerned with learning
about the culture of that time
period."

LaMalfa estimated the total
cost of installation and equipment
for the two ECC dishes to be "in
the neighborhood of “5,000.”
The cost to the university. he said,
was $4,900 with a substantial
amount donated by the Profes-

language was spread throughout

students looking for study space. echoed with the
sound of guitars and clapping and singing.

. Having gone through several folk songs about
unionizing and about the Civil Rights movement of
the l960’s, the group turned to a song called Love‘s
Gonna Carry Us. and together sang what was
described as the unofficial anthem of NYPIRG:

It's been a long hard time,

It’s gonna be a long steep climb,

But no one’s gonna change our minds,
'Boul what we gotta do

And when the road gets rough.
And everybody's saying “just give it up“
