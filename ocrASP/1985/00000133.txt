idea of arms control. In my opi-
nion." he said. "the goal to
achieve superiority over the
Scytet Union in nuclear weapons.

- (is) a superiority which the Soviet

Union would not tolerate our
having. This attempt. this drive,‘
is going to make arms agreements
virtually impossible." Harrison
added. “it is a populasr myth.
propagated by the press. that
‘what is good for us is bad for the
Soviet Union and vice versa'."

Mitchell Goldstein of, High
Frontiers and the Capital District
of Peace Through Strength dif-
ferentiated High Frontiers. which
is a space-based non-nuclear
system to defend America against
incoming nuclear missiles. from
the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI). explaining that “High
Frontiers is something (we could
be) doing right now. The High
Frontier is put into effect for thir-
ty. thirty-five million dollars. and
will be up, working. saving your
neck in two to five years. While
critics scoff, the public. in
general. seems to appreciate the
common sense approach of
defending ourselves. Therefore.
what is the sin in attempting to
develop a defense against ' the
Soviet attempt. Governments are
formed for just about. the 'sole
purpose of defending the nation
against attack. Otherwise. there is
very little purposefor a national
government. and it so states in
our own constitution.”

When asked If the U.S. should
negotiate with Russia, D'Elia
said. “we owe it to ourselves. to
the globes. .to
negotiate."

.Gcldstein, disagreed. _,. ‘SIll/e:

shouldnot negotiate; with the
Russians. To the Russian mentali-
ty. negotiation is, just another
form of warfare. If;ypp.,do,n’t
believe me. Please read their, own
periodicals. Anything .they- sign
cannot be trusted."

Korowitz stated thatwc ',‘.can’t
expect much...until. we can learn
to respect each ,othcr.?’ Goldstcin
asserted that treaties have not
been effective, while Sloan noted
that "neither side has negotiated
in good faith.”

Most panelists agreed on
negotiating down offensive
missiles. Kendall suggested to
"Whittle down to bare minimal
defensive missiles (with no offen-
sive)." Harrison said. “don‘t
negotiate weaponsfnegotiate in-
terests. We have a whole area of
mutqu interests ——- like survival.
for example." Goldstcin said he
owuld negotiate only if he was
“dragged in kicking and
screaming."

As for the future of dterrcnts.
Harrison said he felt it was
“poor...thcrc would be a greater
chance for accidents." while Ken-
dall proposed that “maybe (a

winter," lamented Dumisani
Kumalo of the American Com-
mittee on Africa (ACA), referring
to the scarcity of. student protest
against South African racial
segregation during the beginning
months of I983.

But. In the dead of winter. the

student anti-apartheid movement”

suddenly heated up. surprising
even movement leaders.

Fueled by Jesse? Jackson's
ongoing anti-apartheid crusade.
South African Bishop Desmond
Tutu’s recent winning of the
Nobel Peace Prize.‘ numerous
marches on U.S.-based South
African diplomatic ofﬁces. and
the arrests of some 200 protesters
since. late November. I984. the
campus South African movement
is going strong, leaders report.

“A lot more students, because
of the media attention South
Africa has been getting among the
general public. are suddenly
becoming aware and interested in
stopping apartheid.” noted
Joshua Nessen. ACA student
coordinator. »

Nesscn. who in the past has
tried to spread. the ‘word by
associating it .with more highly-
publicized causes like the anti-
nuclear movement, thinks he may
have turned a corner.

“You know the campus move-
ment is gaining momentum when,
in the midst of Christmas vaca-
tion at Berkeley. you have 1.000
students marching on the ad-
ministration building. locking
arms. and demanding
divestiture." he said.

lndeedy in just the last two
months studentson dozens of
campuses across the country halve
protested the plight of the black
majority In South Africa. deman-
dlhg‘l that their colleges ‘stop in-
vestirig'ln U.S. companies which
do business" with - the white
supremidist-govcrnmcnt there.

During the 'December 7th
march at Berkeley. for instance.
38 students were arrested as over
1.000 protesters encircled the ad-
ministration building for three
hours.

The day before. several hun-
dred University‘ of Maryland-

Until the office and security Is
tightened up. the Test Bank hours
will be irregular. According to
Miller. once ﬁling cabinet locks
are replaced and other minor
security measures are taken to
protect the property of the Con-
trollcr’s Office, the technical
holders of access rights to the Of-
flcc. the Test Bank will remain

Likewise. a group of University

“Board of Regents. you can't
hide. we charge you with

cent board of regents meeting
demanding the UT system sell its
estimated $600 million in South
African-linked stock holdings.

And in a somewhat more
radical tactic. 12 members of
Oberlin College’s Student Coali-
tion Against Apartheid tried un-
successfully to shut down the
campus computer system and
hold it hostage until the school
sold off its $30 million in South
African-tied companies.

Accustomed to a regular.
organized series of student pro-
tests during the warmer, spring
months. this winter's spon-
taneous uprisings have caught
even anti-apartheid activists by

“divestiture will not succeed and

“It's a controversial issue on

spokesman David Roscn, “an
issue on which students and facul-
ty are deeply divided."

“With publicity at a high level.
it will bfvital to follow up with
protests and demonstrations on
campuses this spring." ACA's
Nessen explained. '

“With an extensive campus

Such "divestiture." they say.

pressure the government to
amend its racist policies or lose
American business. -

“It’s too soon to tell if (thi
winter's campus protests) are ac-
tually resulting in more colleges
divesting of South African-tied
stock." said Knight.

“But they are going to find it
harder and harder to stall as long
as there Is continued student pro-
test and as more states and

Famine aids Peace Corps recruitment

(COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE) The
famine in Africa has inspired an

unprecedented number of.

students to inquire about joining
the Peace Corps in recent weeks.

More than 12.000 prospective
recruits — as many as 8.000 of
them college students - have
called the agency since Jan. IOth,
when it launched an appeal for
workers with agricultural-related
skills to help combat the famine
in Africa.

Nearly a» month after the
recruitment drive was launched.
calls are still coming in at three
times the normal rate. The in-
terest has been so strong that the
agency may met its recruitment

goals for the first time in 24 years.
Peace Corps ofﬁcials said.

“it‘s incredible what we've
created." marvelled press ofﬁcer
Ron DcForc. “We’re breaking all
records, both for quantity and
quality." DcForc acknowledges
the unprecedented response is
almost entirely attributable to
widespread publicity in recent
months of the extreme famine
conditions across much of Africa.

“The most common reaction to
our pitch used to be 'Gee. I didn’t
know the Peace. Corps '_WRS still
around.” DeForc recalled.
“Now, it seems we've reawaken-
ed the American population as a
whole to the fact that the Corps is
still alive. Ci
