pic alternate. the NCAA title was one he
had long coveted. This weekend, in what
DeMeo called a near-perfect effort. he got
it.

in the four matches Seras wrestled. the
only points scored against him were escape
points. most of which Seras gave up
voluntarily.

“He wrestled smart. tough. aggressive,
and near-perfect." said DeMeo. ‘

Seras' ﬁrst match, against St. Lawrence,
was won by forfeit. The St. Lawrence
coach. hoping to advance his wrestler fur-
ther in the tournament. was afraid to risk
an injury against Seras and threw in the
towel.

“It was the only time that was done in
the entire match.” said DeMeo.

Seras' second match was aginst
Broekport's Scott Slade. in what DeMeo
calls an almost identical match to their

freestyle. he had a 49.4 and inlthe 50-yard I

freestyle Feldman swam like a
powerhouse. taking him to the consolation
finals. "

“Overall Jeff Kennedy and Mike
Feldman‘ were key in the competition.
Their times really dropped. They sto'od out
in the meet." said Ball.

Fred—Greenbaum, another dynamo in
the States. broke the record in the 50—yard
freestyle with a 22.4. He also had a decent
time in the lOO-yard free with a 48.9.

Doug Ketterer, an up and coming.
sophomore, had his best time ever in the
ZOO-yard breaststroke clocking a 2:30.

‘Andrew Motola took a 1:07 in the
lOO-yard breaststroke, which was a season
best for him. _

Frank Cawley had a great weekend.

NCAA championship,

SUNYAC confrontation, Seras easily
defeated Slade.

“It was unbelievable," said DeMeo of
the match. “He took him down in the ex-
.act same spot with the exact same take
down. " .

Seras' third match was against an oppo-
nent from Trenton State. the team that
went on to win the championship.

in the fourth and final round, Seras

defeated Matt Bouslog, the top seeded

wrestler of the match. With the victory
came the long sought-after title.

“I expected to win the title, said Seras,“
but when you finally get. it sure tastes
good." good."

“Andy did a great job and deﬁnitely
deserved to win." said Averill of his team-
mate. “No one worked harder than Andy,
and I‘m very happy for him. He will
definitely place in Division 1."

"Andy was just so amazing." said
DeMeo. “He has proven himself to be the
greatest wrestler in Albany State history,

breaking his own records in the
500-freesty1e with a 5112.2 and in the
ZOO-yard freestyle with a 1:56. He cut his
times down a great deal in this important
meet. '

1n the 500-yard freestyle, Michael .

Wright pulled a season’s best time of 5:07.
He also performed with excellence in the
[00-yard backstroke. taking a 1:01,
another season's best for Wright.

Captain Jeff Ball ended his college
career taking two personal best times in the
100 and ZOO-yard freestyles with a 1:10 arid.

2:12 respectively.

Another best time was captured by Dean
Wilson in the ZOO-yard breastroke with a
2:27 in that race and .lim Neiland in the
500-yard freestyle with a 5:23.

every bit as good as he could be."

Patterson. "1 think people on the team

The divers did great as expected. Mike

seventh.

“People basically did well at their own

. “You seethese people everydayflt’s like

 you just ma‘de'fifty‘new‘ friends. It's people '

doing what you like to do." commented

freshman swimmer Doreen-Clark about "

the Albany State swimming teams. .

The Dane women's swimming team
wrapped up their season February 23 at the
SUNYAC Championships held at SUNY-
Oswego with a 7th place finish.

The 1983-84 season compiled a 10 - 1
record. losing only to powcrhouseUniver-
sity of Vermont. First year Head Coacli
Dave Turnage termed this season a “learn-
ing process." He said. “It was more the
team getting to learn me and me getting to
know them." He added that their was a

-lack of recruiting this year.

However. the five freshmen on this
year's team added much needed depth and
diversity to the team effort. “When I first
joined the team 1 did not expect it to be as
friendly as it was. everybody does
everything together. everyone was very ac-
cepting." continued Clark.

Perhaps this is why the team finished
with an 8 - 6 record and six school records
were broken. Clark herself shattered thc
pool record in the 200 backstroke.

Teammate sophotnore Carol Pearl had
an “outstanding season." according to
Turnage. She rewrote the books with new
school records in the 200. 500. 1,000 and
1.650 freestyle events as well as the 400 in—
dividual medley.

This past season was highlighted by a
trip to Pucrto Rico front January 3 — l4.

Wcsti‘icld State. the Danes cndcd the first
half tied at 38. However. Albany's seniors
lcd tlic way in the second half and Albany
won. 78-70.

Leading the way was Hurt. who. in a
complete turnaround from liriduy "18m.
scored 15 points. Adam added 14 and
Ulisprung had 12 its well as nine rebounds.
Surprisingly, Crouticr in his last up
l'cttritncc. haul jtnt three points.

Almost all of the members of both the
men's and .womcn's swim teamswent.
.fl'here,,the teams practiced two titncs a day
for approximately two hours each prac-
tice. Depending on the day. the team
generally swam between seven and eight
thousand yards. This trip not only produc-
ed great tans and sunstreaked hair. but
caused a lot of peoples times to drop a
good deal.

This expedition to Puerto Rico helped in
qualifying seventeen swimmers for the
SUNYAC' Championships. 1n the
SUNYACs, Pearl was once again outstan-
ding, placing fifth in the 100 and SOC-yard
freestyle events as well as sixth in thc
ZOO-yard freestyle race.

in addition. she swam the butterﬂy leg
of the ZOO-yard medley. combining with
Clark (backstroke). sophomore Linda
Cerky (breaststroke) and senior Kris

. Monohan (freestyle) for a 4th place finish.

in terms of next year Turnage said.
“The team itself will do better asa whole.
Recruiting will be a big part of it. it looks
pretty good now. We'll just havcto wait
and see."

Unfortunately Albany State will be 105-
ing seniors Sue Hrib. Jewel.Rambo and
Monohan to graduation. .

Next year’s team will benefit by the
return of All-American diver Janet Men
from a year abroad in Europe.

Although Turnage was hoping to place
better at the SUNYACs, he remains op-
timistic towards the next swimming
season. 1"]
