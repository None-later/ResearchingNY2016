there will be no Final Four for the Danes

themselves for this
defeat. Sports
Analysis

The game promised to
feature four excellent
senior guards; Orville
Bailey and Gregg Fiddes
for the Engineers, and Dave Adam and
Danny Croutier for the Danes. Well, the
four came to play that night. Each hit their
first shot of the game, giving notice that
this contest was going to be won or lost
depending on the guards. You already
know who lost.

For most of the game. Adam and
Croutier kept up their end of the bargain.
They shot a collective 13-for-21 from the
field, as opposed to WPl’s senior duo's
l3-for-28. But when the game got down to
the final few minutes. Albany’s co-
captains were outshined by the heroics of
Bailey.

Bailey was a constant thorn in the
Danes' side. dribbling away from a futile
Albany press. finding an open teammate.
or hitting the jumper himself. Nothing the
Danes tried could deactivate Worcester‘s
main bomb.

“He's the key." said WPl coach Ken
Kaufman. referring to Bailey. When Kauf-
man took Bailey out of the game for a
well-deserved rest, the tri-captain said to
his coach, "l’ve been out too long.
coach." Thirty seconds later. Bailey was
back into the game.

“Shoot the ball. Orville." chanted the
Albany fans who made the two-hour trek
to Worcester. “Orville. shoot the ball." So
Orville shot the ball. Oh, did he ever shoot
the ball. When the Engineers needed a
basket to stay close to the Danes in the se-
cond half. Orville shot the ball. When his
team needed a basket to send the game into
overtime. Orville shot the ball.

“The senior guards did everything that
senior guards should do," said Kaufman.
“Our people know the ropes."

So do the guards from Albany. They
know what's expected of them during

crucial moments. With about 10 seconds
left in regulation and the score tied.
Croutier knew the designed play. With six
seconds left in overtime and Albany down
by one, Adam knew the designed play. Yet
neither player executed the play that could
have wdn the ballgame. .

Croutier was supposed to look to the
high post as he reached the top of the key.
instead of passing off. Croutier took a
wild shot that missed everything.

“There was a set play for that situa-
tion." said Albany Head Coach Dick
Sauers. "Croutier's a four-year player; he
didn’t wait for the play."

in overtime, Croutier passed the ball to
Adam in the corner. Adam was to have
passed the ball back to a cutting Croutier
inside. but passing wasn’t on Adam's
mind. There wasn't any hesitation as

Adam put up a tough shot that didn't have

a prayer.
The funny thing is. you want these guys
shooting the ball when the Danes need a
basket. When Croutier tried that
ridiculous shot in regulation. there was a
sense of expectation that it would go in.
When Adam took that ill-advised shot in
overtime. the snare sense existed.

According to Kaufman. the game came
down to a simple truth: "When we needed
a basket. we hit. The kid 13 (Adam). he
missed." Close. but not quite.

There was the matter of foul shooting.
normally an Albany strong point. The
Danes shot 75 percent from the line this
year. but could only hit 5 of 12 against
Worcester. That's the game. right there.
Albany could have iced the game by hitting
one of those free throws down the stretch.

According to Sauers. the key play in the
game was when Adam Ursprung was foul-
ed going up for a dunk during a three-on-
one situation. Ursprung missed both his
free throws. giving WPl another chance
too many.

“We had our chances."

Did they ever have their chances.
Albany could have put the last nail in
WPl’s coffin on several occasions, but
theyfailed to do so. They had that game in
their back pockets. but a clever pickpocket
named Orville took advantage of a
pushover.

Patietrcc is a virtue. and women‘s track
coach Ron White is as virtuous as the next
guy. All through the indoor season. Coach
White has been working with a team that
dots not have cnough bodies to be truly
competitive as a team.

Stellar individual efforts by women like
Anita Heath. Bette Dznmba. and Donna
Burnhitm have been enough to keep the
couch froth withdrawing into a corner and
talking to himself. That. of course. and
Coach White’s vision of the outdoor
season to cotne. The coach gets a bit starry
eyed when he speaks of the prospect of
coaching it whole tezun outdoors. brrt that
is understandable. given his frustration at
the tttrnottt for the indoor season. Still. the
indoor season hasn‘t been without its
bright spots. arid the State Clutrnpionships
provided il few.

The name Bcllc Dvambrt keeps coming
up, but that's only because she keeps rttrin-
ing so well. Dzambn had her finest day of
the season at the States. taking home the
championship iii the 5000 meters. She
bestcd the field in n time of 18:50.7, and
Coach White was very pleased. iic said.
“That's her first rcitlly big collcgirttc win.
it was il r'cai breakthrough for Bette."
(.‘hris Vurlcy also scored iii the 5000, tak-
ing fifth place in it time of 20:20.3.

Lynn Jacobs also reached hack for it lit-
tic cxtrrt at lllc States. 1n the 1500 trrctcrs.
Jacobs cnmc iti fourth in 4:514. her per-
sulltll best. Subsequently. Jacobs captured

third place in the 3000-melers in a time of
10:45.4. The coach remarked of Jacobs'
versatility. “To score in two events in the
conference championships is a pretty nice
achievement. Lynn is continuing to
improve."

Attila Heath continued in her role as
Albany's best indoor sprinter. Heath grab-
bed second place in the 300 meters with a
time of 44.9 seconds. Coach Wirile tnen-
tioned that. while Heath has had to do all
the work in the sprints indoors. she would
have a lot of help when the outdoor season
begins. Although Patti Barrett didn’t score
any learn points in the 300 meters. she did
run the race in 46.9 which was her best ef-
fort of the season.

Heath anti Barrett learned with Ro-
scannc Smith and Erma George for a
4:42.2 performance in the 4 x 400 relay
race. Barrett ran her leg in 1:06. her best
yet. and Coach White was optimistic. He
said. “Patti has shown sortie rcal improve-
rrtcrtt indoors this year. We‘re looking for-
ward to seeing her outdoors."

Certainly. the loss of Donna ilurnhatn to
an injury didn't help the Danes too rnttch.
Donna. one of the year's steadiesl per-
formers. stayed home nursing a sore shirt
for the upcoming outdoor season. Bur-

when considering this was the only dreary
period in the Danes‘ entire 84-85 season.
Nothing can take away their amazing 23-4
ﬁnal record.

The fact still remains that they lost to i. '

Nazareth. who on Saturday night, simply
played a better ball game. Nazareth led for
a substantial portion of the game. the final
33 minutes to be exact. ,

“We did not play well." said ‘Albany

Head Coach Mari Warner. “We came out
pretty stale and our offense was non-‘
existent. Basically. Nazarethwas a better
team. They won that ball game fair and
square."

first half points.

What the Danes couldn't account for
was the 16 points on pure outside shooting
from players Kris Smith. who shot 3-6.
and Lowe. who shot'4-4.

“When we first came out we did a super
job on defense.“ said coach Warner. “We
were playing a packed 2-1-2. not allowing
the ball inside. i told‘ them not to worry if
they score one or two from the outside. We
weren’t sticking to what 1 wanted, which
was to pack inside unless We were going
out on the shoulder. You can‘t leave
Nazareth just to shoot open shots. you
have to out on them.“

in the second half. the Datrcs outscored
the Golden Flyers 34-32. which just wasn’t
enough to make ‘up for their first half
deficit. _. ‘

With 5:33 remaining in the game.
Nazareth had its biggest lead at 57-38. The

Danes were now playing a jump and run
defense. which is a man to man type of
press. This defense. plus the better offen-
sive play. drew Albany within six points.
As Kim Kosalek sank two frecthrows. the
Dane strrge began. Rainny Lesane passed
inside to Kosalek for two more and follow-

.ed that with an outside shot of her own. as

did Ronnie Patterson. With 57 seconds left

i on the clock the Danes had cut the lead by

outscoring Nazareth 17-4. in the last five
minutes of the game. Kosalek scored 9 of
her'll points. The Dane comeback wasn‘t
fast enough to outrun the clock as the
buzzer sounded with Nazareth ahead
66-57.

“it was too much too late," said
Warner. “Now the last seven minutes we
played ball. Offense was the problem. i
can’t think our defense was that bad. 1 was
freal proud of our team in those last

minutes. We hadn’t done that jump-run
defense in a long time. We converted on
Nazareth's mistakes. which we hadn't
done against Buff State.”

The run a‘ndjump press was supposed to
catch Nazareth off guard and it did.
“That's the ﬁrst time a pass bothered us.”
said Decillis. “For the last ten minutes we
hung on rather than played." This jump

- and run press is tiring and can‘t be played

for a whole half. I

"We put on our run and jump press
which forced them to turnover." said
Lesane. "i think we should have done it at
the beginning of the second half when we
were down and then we could have slowed
it up and put our offense together. it
worked good. but it was too late."

Although the Danes outrebounded the
Flyers 40-31. the Danes’ offensive execu-
tion led to their problems. For Nazareth.
Hickey scored 10 points. Rasey scored 11,
and Kris Smith was high scorer with 15
points. Higgin was held to only 8 points.
while Lowe. who averages 1'/2 minutes a
game. scored 13 points shooting 6 for-6
from the ﬁeld and one for-one from the
frecthrow line.

“1 put Tina in because she‘s the quickest
girl on theteam." said Decillis. “i wanted

- her in'lhere to guard Rainny. She wanted

to go in and play the best player on the
other team."

High scorer for the Danes was Lori
Bayba scoring 16 points from tltc field.
Bayba was followed by Lcsntlc with 14,
Kosalek with 11 and Patterson with 10.
which were all off the floor.

“1 think we didn‘t try to gel the ball in-
side." said Kosalek. “We were relying on
our outside shooting tnorc. but should
have relied on the middle more." Lesane
agreed. “1 don't even think 1 looked down”
low in the beginning."

The fact that they hadn‘t played in a
week hurt the Danes as well. as did not
playing the night before. “Whenever

you‘re off for a week it hurts." said

Warner. “i would have preferred playing
Friday night. Wehn you're in a champion-
ship game you want to play a game to earn
the spot. granted all season long we earned
it."

Relay, gives third to tracksters in SUN. YA Cs

By lan Clements
STAFF WRITER ‘ ’ >

The clutch performance of its
4x400-meter relay team enabled the
Albany State men's indoor track team to
squeeze into third place in the SUNYACs
held at Plattsburgh Saturday. I
' Going into the next-to-last event. the
Danes trailed Buffalo State by one-half
point. and the relay found itself in the un-
fortunate position of having to run in the
slower unseeded heat.

Undaunted. the team of Johlt Reilly.
Pat Saccocio (52.0). Ed Levy and Mike

- Riggins blew away the other teams in their
heat. They then watched as each team in
the seeded section, except Fredonla. failed
to beat their time of 3:335. Buffalo State
finished .07 secondsbehind Albany. The
Danes ‘moved ahead of the Bengals into
third in the team standings.

Albany clihched third in the final event.
the 4x800-meter relay. by placing fifth.
one position ahead of Buffalo State. The
team of Charles Blanchet. Ed McGlll.
Craig Parlato and Jim Erwin ran 8:253.

in the team battle. Fredonia‘ had little
trouble claiming its third consecutive title.
Their score of 173 was '71 points better
than Cortland's. The Danes scored 66
points. while Buffalo State had 63%
points. There were nine teams entered in
the fifth annual meet.

The other "highlight" of the meet for
Albany, according to Coach Bob Munsey,
was the 3.000-nreter run. in which the
Danes scored 12 points. their highest total
for one event. ‘

Again. the Purple had to overcome the .

unseeded heat handicap. Freshman Patty
Paul (8:58.43) and junior Kevin Sheehan
(8:592) ran away from the field in the
“slow” section. They were able to score
because only three runners in the "fast"
section had quicker times. One of those
three was sophomore Tim Hoff. The
Bronx native placed third in 8:55.7, a time
less than two seconds shy of the state meet
qualifying standard. .

Albany's only individual winner was
(surprise!) Marc Mercurio in the 3S-pound
weight. The splendid senior tossed the
weight 50’10". "not a very good throw.”
according to Munsey. but good enough to
beat his closest rival by almost two feet.

The easy victory was Mcrcurio's fifth in
six meets. He will face his stif fest competi-
tion of the season Friday when he,travels
to Bates College in Lewiston, Maine to
compete in the Division 111 nationals.
There. he will attempt to revenge his only
less of the campaign (to Union's Scott
Remillard) and to win his first national
title.

“He's ranked third or fourth right now.
but that's a crazy thing. no one's that far
ahead of him." said Munsey. “He could
win it. he could finish third. 1 don't think
he‘ll be below third." Munsey added.

On the track. the Danes picked up two
third place medals from runners who have
been weakened by illness recently. John
Reilly battled that debilitating disease
known as "slow heat" to place third in the
400-meter run. Munsey called his split of
51.45. “a real breakthrough." Jim Erwin

also broke through. He lowered his best
1.500-meter time of the season by five
seconds in running 4:05.6 to qualify for
the state meet.

Sophomore Jack Glaser was fifth in the
1.500 (4:14).

in one of the toughest fields of the day.
the 5.000-meter run, Ed McGill placed
fourth. The Charlestown native's time of
15:18.2 was his best of the season but was
far behind that of Cortland‘s Tim
Wunsch. "who won in a blazing 14:47.6.

“Ed hasn't settled down to a real good
time yet." said Munsey. “he's not getting
in two hard practices each week and that's
hurting him."

Junior Bruce Van Tassel was Albany's
final scorer in the individual rtrnning
events. His time of 8.0 in the 55-meter high
hurdles was good enough for fifth.

Freshman Clinton Bell was not fast
enough to score in the BOO-meter run
despite splitting 2:01.2.

The Dane distance medley skipped one
lap en route running a fine 10:16. Credit
for the errorf must go to the officials who
sent the nnchormen onto the track one lap
too early.

“The Plattsburgh officials were
negligent and incompetent." charged
Albany's Tom Kacandes. whose
1.200-meter leg was shortened by the
miscue. "They should never host a major
meet again." he added.

The irtcldent allowed Fredonlu to move
closer to the Danes since Kucurrdes'
finishing kick was cut short. Pariato ran it
tough anchOr leg but was unable to withs-

tand the charge of the Blue Dcvils‘ Kevin
Rumsey. Other Danes on the second place
squad were Dave Blelte (SOC-meters in
2:01.5) and Saccocio (400-metcrs in 52.0).

Newcomers Cttrl Wicdman anti Pal
Dowling pole vaulted 13‘ and 12'6" to
finish fourth and sixth.

Albany also picked up a sixth in the tri-
ple jump. with Paul Mance leaping 43‘10
1/4".

The Danes were hampered by a lack of
depth. They failed to score in scvcn of the
eighteen events.

That weakness may haunt thcnr March
15 and 16 when they travel to Cortland for

. the state meet. “1 don't think we'll do well

.n the meet. team-wise," Munsey said.

The team discovered Saturday that a
meet they thought they had won was ac-
tually a loss.

Albany had “beaten” Plutlsburgh on
February 16 because a Cardinal relay was
.lisqrtalified on the grounds that its an-
chorman wore a 'f-shirt under his uniform
top. Munsey and the Platlsburgh coach
had consulted a 1984 rulebook at the little.
When they checked the 1985 edition Satur-
day. they discovered that the rule had been
repealed and the controversial T-shirt was
legal.
