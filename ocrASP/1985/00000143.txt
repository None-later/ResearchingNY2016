Minorities often share Same pains, Struggles

 

By Patrice dohnson

“i cried within

And no soul dried my tears
Because only me and my God
knew of my pain

it was when i cried out loud,
That 1 discovered that my tears
were wiped

Yes, somebody shared and knew

of my pain."
Beyond
Because there
are many disad- 
vantages that Majority

the minority
student must
encounter on a predominantly
white campus that aren't always
expressed or addressed. here's an
opportunity for their voices to be
heard as minorities express the
unfortunate imbalances that con-
front them as non-majorities.
According to Laurie Midgett,
president of Albany State Univer-
sity Black Alliance (ASUBA), the
major disadvantages for
minorities on campus are that
“most professors are white in the
university except when you look
at the discipline of African-Afro
American studeis or Puerto
RicangLatin American studies.

it's a disadvantage because there
is a lack of role models and hardly
any in the administration as well.
By consistently having a eurocen-
tric view of things. one’s perspec-
tive becomes limited. Also. by be-
ing the only minority in a class.

alienation from peers can result. >

This allows room for the‘ student
to become discouraged from lear-
ning. On the other hand, it pro-
vides a challenging atmosphere by
which that minority may excel."

Also along these lines, Eric
Bowman, Minority Affairs Coor-
dinator for Student Association,
expressed the major disadvan-
tages he said are the “lack of
minority professors. if there were
a greater number of black and
hispanic professors on campus.
minority students would be able
to have a closer relationship with
their professors. because they
would be coming from the same
ideological background. They
would also serve as role models
and would be able to \offer
minority students a counseling
advisement relationship that is
greatly needed. This would in
turn, increase the retention rate of
minority students."

“Another disadvantage is the
number of minority students on
an undergraduate level and
especially, on the graduate level.
Because of the small number of
minority undergraduates, this
hurts the academic and social
relationships of students.

On the graduate level, the small
enrollment of minority students
in graduate programs hurts the
academic learning of
undergraduates in a large univer-

sity like SUNYA because most
graduate students serve as
graduate or‘ teacher assistants,

'and‘ they play a closer role with

the students than the professors
as far as grading and discussion.
Also, the lack of minorities in
graduate programs hurts the
overall growth of the. minority
community because it is in
graduate schools where most of
our doctors/scientists academia
are made."

Carlos Laboy, president of
Fuerza Latina. expressed the
disadvantages that confront
minorities. especially hispanics on
campus. Laboy said he feels that
one of the major problems “is the
misunderstanding of cultural dif-
ferences." Laboy illustrated this
misunderstanding by telling how
at their (Fuerza Latina's) social
functions many students do not
participate because they cannot
relate" to the different 'type of
music of the hispanic culture.
Laboy said that there iS'a lack of
support for functions because of
the lack of understanding of
cultural differences and
therefore, less money" comes in-
to their organization from social
functions.

On another level, Laboy added
that there are “a lack of hispanics
in management and ad-
ministrative positions in the
SUNY system. F-terza Latina is
recruiting hispanic students for’
the campus because it’s the only
way that the university communi-
ty will understand more of our
culture. There’s only one EOP
advisor. if you want the school to
do more for minorities, you have

. to recruit more.” Laboy added.

“the radio station has no hispanic
representatives. A couple of years
ago. they had a hispanic program
on the radio, but they cut it out.
Also, the radio station only has
five up to date records that it
plays that reflect hispanic
music/culture."

The voice _ of Edana Essa,
graduate assistant for the Afro-
ﬁmerican Studies Department
and DJ. for WCDB's Third
World program relayed that the
major problems for minorities on
campus is “the fact that we haVe
to try twice as hard to be twice as
good to achieve certain things.
(For example, in the athletic
department, student gdvernment,
and University Concert Board
(UCB).) The ruling people on this
campus are white. They control
everything on this campus, and
for us .to get what we want
(especially black artists) we have
to combine together and force
groups like UCB by our presence
to get what we should get being
students on this campus. The
Financial Aid Office assumes that
all minority students are on EOP
in a negative way. Residential

Life tries to present an image of '

equality and fairness with regards
to usual ethnic backgrounds,
disabled students. religion, and so
forth.". Laboy summed up his
experience as a hispanic minority
and the goals he projects in the
words used at a conference on
Hispanic Issues at Brooklyn Col-
lege in 1972, “We desire to build
within the university a place
where the intellectual and cultural
ward of our community can be

  

performed. Our goal is an infor-
mant understanding of the
economic, political, and cultural
forces that have shaped our past
and may define our future asset
collectivity." ~ I

Jackie Kennedy, Vice President‘
of the Pan Carribbean Associa-
tion, stated that the problem that
is crucial for minorities is that
“RA. and SA. positions are not
as available to us.;?l‘his holds true
especially on Dutch Quad where
most of its residents are of Jewish
ethnicity. Also S.A. does notgive
enough money‘ to the. minority
organizations as they do to ‘UCB
and other non-minority
organizations.” _

Other minority students ex-
pressed that there are a lot of op-
portunities that the majority does
not inform us of. Many students
said they felt that we pay the same
amount of activity dues, but our
activities reflect inferiority
because of the noticeable im-
balance.
have an academic disadvantage
because'of the inferiority of ,the
public schools that we attended
before our entrance into a maze
of competitiveness in this
predominantly white and ad-
vanced institution. .

Well these are our voices from
different angles and means of
deliverance. We speak not just to
utilize stilled. energy. We speak
not just to expose. We speak not
just to relieve our inner-selves.
We speak not just to inform or to
illustrate our- articulations. We
speak for - change -— and
emergence of change. We speak
for now. , -. El

Students’ rights to privacy must be pro-
tected in the event of a 21 year old drinking
age in New York. but SUNYA officials
also need to ensure compliance with the
law at large events, according to testimony
heard at an Impact of 21 Committee hear-
ing held Thursday in the Campus Center.

Paul Doyle of the Ofﬁce of Residential
Life said, "alcoholic beverages play a
signiﬁth role in events." Even if the 21

year old drinking age was put into effect, '

“people under 21 will still drink," asserted
Doyle. There 'willb’e pressu'res to distribute
‘the alcohol illegaliy,;and there also will be
piessures on student groups planning ac-
tivities. “Alcoholic beverages will still be
in demand," said Doyle. 7 ' ' .
Doyle pointed out‘that if legislation for
21 does occur, it would be a good oppor-
tunity to set somestandards. Residential
Life would develop more of a relationship
with students involvdd in programming. he

said, and there may also be non-alcoholic-

.events. Doyle also said that he doesn’t
want to see Residence Assistants only en-
forcing rules. That is not the only job they
have he explained, adding that if 21 went
into effect, tension could develop between

Residential Life and potential residence,

staffers. This tension could make it
“harder to recruit the top staff people.”

Residence Diiector, said, "if 21 went into

' more or less." '

STAFF WRITER

In a bylaws change approved last Sun-
day, the New York Public Interest
Research Group (NYPIRG) recently voted
to downsize its Board of Directors from 48
to 31 members. SUNY Albany will lose
one of its three board rnccmbers, but its
percentage of representatives will remain
unchanged.

Karen McMahon, chair of NYPIRG’s
Board of Directors, said that 48 is an ‘un-
wieldy’ number, and 31 would be easier to
,handle. Reached in New York City by
telephone, McMahon said that NYPlRG
was ready for‘ a change. .

“We've had the exact same criteria since
1973," said McMahon, adding that “we
started with five schools and eight
representatives. The structure. combined
with inflationary pressure. has forced us to
see into the future."

The size of the NYPIRG board is based
on funding. The higher the amount of
money collected in fees by a college, the
more representation they receive. Over the
years. with inflation causing overall price
increases in all areas, funding has increas-
ed, and so have the number of represen-
tatives on the Board.

"With 48 board members, our monthly
meetings became hard to handle,” said
NYPlRG executive director Tom Wathen.
“With a smaller board, you have discus-
sions of policies. Witlt 48, it becomes
mostly parliamentary procedure," he
added.

McMahon said NYPlRCt is always. look-
ing to expand its activities and that she sees
the benefits of downsizing as fairer
representation of member schools, and in-
creased growth.

MCMahon said she believes NYPlRG is
going through a period of self-
rcevalnntibh. “A twélv‘e year old organiza-
tion has ways of developing lenders. runn-
ing campus ' programs. building cum»

palgns, etcetern. and. we are looking at'

ways to do it‘ hib‘té creatively." ’ "

will be more chances for abuse if there is

' drinking in the dormitories.

Longendyke, agreeing with Doyle. ad-
ded that. “a 21 year old drinking age will
make Residence AssistantsI jobs and direc-
tors’ jobs moreydifﬁcult.”

. '* Residential Life “needs to pay more at-

tention before it goes up to 21," said ..

Longendyke, adding that "if we ignore 21,
people. will get blasted in their rooms and
vthen'go‘ out and do damage" to property
or' disturb other students.- ' '

Steve Oawley, Student Action Commit-
tee ‘Chair, is concerned about students’
rights lit the dorms. Gawley said he is also _
cancel-bed about RA’s having to act as a
policeforce. '

“it is the obvious abuses that should be
worried about, rather than worrying about
having’ a couple of six packs in the
refrigerator," said Gawley. expiaing that
obvious possible abuses such as minors at-
tendingi'iarge parties should receive the
most attention.

“There is a need for non-alcoholic
events, but also a need for alcoholic pro-
grams," he stated. On each quad, there is
a sizeable amount of 21 year’olds, but
there are also many people who are
underage, said Gawley. “There will be a
need for
Gawlcy, adding that “a dry campus is
totally unenforceable."

'Any new alcohol policy must represent
students‘ rights to privacy, Gawley said,
adding that “as long as they don’t bother
anyone, they should be able to drink in
their own suite." ‘

Larry Hartman, a Central Council
representative and Student Action
Research Chair, said there are two partsto
campus life. There is an educational part
and a socialization part, which he said,

efficiency, communicatiOn

Wathen said that downsizing will help
NYPIRG better use the time of student
board members, since the Board meets on-
'ly ’once a month to‘ discuss issues,
strategies, and organization concerns.

Wathen started as a full time NYPlRG .

employee in 1979. "Back then we voted
not to downsize. At the time, more was
better," said Wathen, but, he added, “in
1981 we saw inflation cutting our funding,
and we petitiond and had referenda to
raise fees at campuses." ‘

The NYPlRG board continued to grow
because of money and general organiza-
tional advancements. “We began to spend
a lot of money. and we saw small as being
better for the Board," said Wathen.

The proportion and structure of the
NYPlRG board willremain the same, ac-
cording to McMahon. Phil D'Elia, a
SUNYA representative to the NYPlRG
board, said that the loss of one represen-
tative will not make any difference in
terms of policy.

"This decision was based on historical
evolution," said D'Elia. “it‘s something
that’s been needed. The only question is
how to do it fairly with equity and equal
representation.”

The new system makes large boards
unlikely. since, in the past a fund increase
typically meant an added representative
for the particular college. Now. if there is a
referendum on campus for a fund in~
crease, that school will not automatically
obtain increased representation, according
to McMahon.

The NYPIRG board members voted
overwhelmingly for the decrease in size at
the most recent meeting, held in tltc Lec-
ture Centers on the SUNYA campus. “We
had to pass it this time or wait until next
year,” D’Ella said, since campus elections
for next year’s board will take place soon
at some schools. . '

, D'Eliu abstained front the vote because ,

he'felt that the final arrangement could.

L“prepares us for the world. Drinking is a
significant tool in our society," said Hart-
man, towards socialization.

. Hartman, agreeing with Gawley, said
that a dry campus “won’t work, a
Residence Assistant will have to bust in on
students who are drinking in their suites."
For students, there should be “autonomy
.in the suite rooms," said Hartman.

Nathaniel Charny, a Student Associa-
tion of the State University delegate, said
“21 'will not win." Part of the college ex-
perience is educational and social, and a
“dry campus is the worst thing that could
happen," said Charny.

Charny stressed that Residential Life
has to remain consistent in how it deals
with alcohol. “it has to be the same for all
quads and for all dorms," he said. [J

Since the beginning of this semester-
there has been a sign on the door of 'the
Jewish Students Lounge that reads “The
lounge is temporarily closed. We will
reopen in a few days." The semester is
almost half over and the lounge is still
closed.

According to Chair of The Flame, Steve
Greenbaum. "We don't have the people to
run it.” Greenbaum said “We put a sign
up sheet on the wall. but people don’t
show up and we can’t leave the door open,
because there are valuable things in the
lounge that we don’t want stolen."

“it was a good idea," said Greenbaum,
“but it takes coordination and there are no
incentives." He said he is looking into the
possibility of getting funding for a. full
time position next year and hopes to get
funding from the community.
