that far off. campus and trying to get in-
volved in activities. 1 think we missed out
on a lot," she said.

Her sophomore year. Zusman moved to
Colonial Quad. “it (Colonial) was where
you lived if you weren't a radical and you
weren’t in a fraternity or sorority. it was
the jock quad."

A fresh living on Colonial now, Bridget
McElduff, described it as “rowdy” and
said-there are a lot of “sports people."

McElduff didn't’secm to be bothered by
the fact that she wasn't living with most of
the other people from her classion State.‘
“’i'm in a hall that's all mixed and I like
that," she said.

Martone said he will be trying to reduce
the abundance of first year students on
State; “We'll be moving the Soviet pro-
gram from Dutch to State and we may
make fraternity housing available on State
Quad,” he said.

in the early 70’s “Colonial and Dutch
had a preponderance of fraternities and
sororities," said Woodruff. “When they
left the campus things changed."

screw things up." ~

D'Elia, llkc Wathen and McMahon,

six weeks, that it is Important to concen-

“We spend too much time on business.

with all of the quads. When asked if he
thought there was any truth to the
stereotypes that have developed he said no,

“not if Colonial is considered

A SUNYA graduate of I973, Karen
Hausler said, “Alumni 'was always all
freshmen. it was kind of free wheeling,”
she said. "There were a lot of parties, but

it was very self contained."

Mark Lipsy. a present SUNYA junior,
called Alumni Quad :1 “stereotypic stew."
Although Lipsy lives on Dutch he said he
visits friends on Alumni and finds kind of
an assortment of people living there. “it's
a strange mix and kind ofwild,” he said.

Lipsy chose Dutch because of the

Kosher Kitchen. “That’s why

there’s a
