According to Robinson, the
decision is hinging on many fac-
tors, but a major inﬂuence will be
the plans to build a Civic Center
downtown near the hotel and the
subsequent needs it would create.
“Right now, we are conducting
market studies which show a
growing need in downtown
Albany for hotels," said
Robinson.

Robinson also stated that
“although the owners are trying
to take the students into con-
sideration, their decision will
ultimately be based on what will
work out best financially."

If the Blases decide not to
house students at the Wellington

tance would be the least physical-
ly abusive and the most verbally
abusive.

Cox also developed hypotheses
on the effects that different kinds
of rape have on women. “l ex-
pected victims of ‘stranger rape’
to experience the most intense
anxiety and the least intense guilt,
and victims of romantic acquain-
tance rape to have the least
amount of depression and the
most amount of guilt." she said.

Cox explained that pre-existing
literature viewed stranger rape as
more devastating. The results of
her experiment, however, proved
this theory false.

SUNY housing problem, said
Martone. ’
Students at the Wellington,
who are primarily juniors and
seniors. Stated that most of them
chose to live there for speciﬁc
reasons. Many said they liked the'
privacy. the proximity to
downtown, the jobs available
nearby, and “getting away from
on-campus dorm life."

Because of this, Martone said,
if the Wellington does not house
students next semester. off-
campus apartments will become
even more in demand.

As far as on-campus housing is
concerned. Martone said that

cupancy to accomodatc displaced
Wellington students and other:

the offender was, the effects were
the same," Cox said. Women still
felt the same guilt, fear and anxie-
ty, whether they knew the of-
fender or not. she explained.

Cox’s hypothesis was also
wrong on the levels of violence us-
ed, she said, saying she found that
the level of violence seemed to be
the same in all incidents, but
“women raped by romantic ac-
quaintance might have found the
abuse more violent because it
came from someone they cared
about and did not expect it."

“I found that just the fact that
the rape took place had traumatic
effects,“ Cox said. "Once it pro-
gresses to rape it is not so impor-
tant who raped you. Just the fact
that you were in a violent situa-
tion is devastating to the victim."

dent as -the faculty at SUNYA';
the quality of education is the
same."

Judy Bernard, a senior at
SUNYA with a Public Affairs
major and Business minor. who
participated in the Denmark pro-
gram in fall I983, said “I loved it,
it’s the most fantastic time and
it’s so worthwhile not to be in a
rut for four years.” She added,
“I'll have a lot to talk about in an
interview,” commenting on the
many academic experiences she
had with Danish" companies and
factories.

“One thing that we’re trying to
bring to the attention of students
is that many programs require no
knowledge of foreign language."
said Dr. Alex Shane. director of
SUNYA's International Pro-
gram. "The' programs are
available for a variety of ma-
jors." he added.

SUNYA sponsors programs in
Denmark.. England, Israel,
Japan, the Netherlands and
Singapore, which do not have
foreign language requirements,
according to Hannelore Passan-
no. Co~director of the Abroad
Program at Albany. Over 100
programs are available to Albany
students through other SUNY
campuses, she noted. several of
which have no foreign language
prerequisite. “We come close to
having something for almost
every type of major within ‘the
SUNY programs." said Passano,
who added that the scope of these
programs extends to over 33
countries.

In Albany-sponsored pro-
grams, students have the oppor-
tunity to study international

Zusman only knew of Indian

Susan Bertenthal. a .SUNYA
junior, requested Indian as a
trash because “i heard it was the
quietest and the nicest. it's an up-
perclassmen quad," she said.

Both Lipsy and Woodrut'f said
they didn’t see much difference in

said Lipsy, “and I don't see it
changing in the near future."
“For any group to have a per-

“but when it gets to putting

McElduff said she picked h'E‘r:

The problem is that “people ‘
