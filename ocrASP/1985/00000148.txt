STAFF WRITER

After much time, energy, hard
work. and dedication, the Albany
State women’s gymnastic team
will cap off a superb season
tomorrow night at the University
gym, as they host the ECAC
championships.

The Dane gymnasts have been
seeded fifth with their top three
scores averaging to be lSl.733.
They are preceded by ithaca
(163.82). Connecticut State Col-
lege (i56.75). Salem State College
(155.95). and Bridgewater State
College (lSl.783). The competi-
tion will be close and the main
goal of the Lady Danes is to beat
Salem State, whom they lost to by
only .8 earlier in the season.

"it is an honor to be hosting
the largest athletic conference in
the nation." said Karen Davis.

“Despite injuries the team has
managed to keep its spirit,”
stated Captain Lynn Saruvis.
“Everyone is psyched to compete
in the last meet of the season in
front of a big home crowd."

“The girls are looking to have
a good time and to move up from
fifth seed in front of a home
crowd.“ commented Coach Pat
Diwali-Spillane. “There is a

special feeling among the girls as
this is a Division iii Champion-
ship and the girls will be com-
peting at their own talent level.”
The girls have competed against
Division i schools, namely Ver-
mont and L.i.U.

“We're working on getting our
routines and our heads are
together for Saturday." said
Brenda Armstrong. the team’s all
around competitor. “it would be
nice to place in the ECAC‘s but
i’m not expecting it - i’m just
hoping for a high score to qualify
for regionals."

The Danes would have to at-
tain a very high score in the
ECAC's to qualify for Regionais
as a team. They are presently
seeded seventh and only the top
six teams qualify. The Lady
Danes continue to get stronger
every year evidenced by last year‘s
eighth seeding in the regionals.

With an 8-3 record. the Dane
gymnasts are entering the com-
petition after having had one of
their most successful dual meet
seasons. Their success began in
December. when they easily
defeated Hunter College in their
seasonal debut. then went on to
place fifth in the Springfield in-

Donna Burnham: ‘Baby, she was born to run ’ 

By Rachel Braslow

Do you ever wonder why the blond girl
"in the black spandex running tights. runn-
ing to the beat of Madonna. is out running
the perimeter at l:00 a.m.’I

While the majority of the Albany cum-
pus is eating pinu, watching Letterman.
studying. or sleeping. Donna Burnhnm is
out running. Running because of a pcr<
sonal drive and determination. She is striv-
ing to be the best well-rounded. student-
uthlctc she can be. Caring. motivated. and
dedicated are just some of the words which
describe the Albany State junior.

Dotma. formerly of New Paltz. has
been recognized by friends. team
members. and coaches us it truly outstan-
ding athlete.

Her running career actually began its
first stages in elementary school. After
watching Donna continually beat her peers
in races at recess. her teachers encouraged
her to enter road races. At age eight. she
placed second in her age group in her first
road race. The thrill of competing and
competition began to take on new
meanings.

As a 7th grader Donna competed on her
high school team. She ran cross-country
and outdoor track. Because her school did
not have an indoor track learn. she corn-
pctcd in both basketball and gymnastics.

Unfortunately. Donna's running career
has been plagued by all too many stress
fractures. She says the doctors have nt-
tributcd this to her runnittg so cttrly. The.
bones growing couldn't take the constant
pounding of running. ’i'hc doctors advised
her to give up running and start swimmings
She liked running too tnuch to stop. As a
result. she spent half of her high school
years on crutches. Not only does liurnltnm
run. but she also cotttpctcs in at least three
triuthttlons a summer.

in addition, Donna competes on the
cross-countrv. indoor. and outdoor truck

 

“Everyone works
together and shares
' the pain together. If
you’re unmotivated at
practice, the others
will heIp you on.”

—Donna Burnham

 

teams for the Danes. She holds school
records in the indoor l.500(4:53) and the
outdoor l.500(4:54). as well as the
l.000(3:08). and was a member of the
Albany State record-holding 2 mile relay
team. .

She was a strong factor in the 8th place
finish of the cross-country team at the
NCAA Division iil Nationals held at Ohio
Wesleyan University in November.

“it was like a dream that every runner
has. to make the nationals." said Bur-
nham. “ As it got closer. i tried to block it
out of my mind. it never seemed possible.
i still didn't believe it when we did it."

Cross-country is Donna‘s favorite
season. A big factor in this is the "family"
type atmosphere created by the closness of
the learn members.

Shc continually stresses how important
being part of a team is to her.

"i really get along with all the girls on
the team, says Burnhum. “Everyone
works together and shares the pain

together. if you’re unmotivated at practice
the others will help you on. No one is out
to beat each other. The traveling is fun.
everyone gets along. it takes a lot of ner-

vousness and anxiety out of meets. it's so.

close it‘s like being part of a family."

ironically. she remembers as a freshman
telling head cross-country coach Ron
White that she'really didn’t like to run
anything over a mile. She said: "i really
like the coach. He never y'ells or puts
pressure on you. if you’re going to make it
you've got to do it on your own. l feel that
he’s tnorc thttn a couch. For any problems
that i‘ve had he's always been there. his
door is always open. He‘s not just thereon
the truck."

Although practice takes up at least two
hours a day and meets can take up two
days in u titne. she still feels it‘s easier to
keep up her grades. She added. "i’m a lot
tnorc disciplined. Now without practice 1
watch soups. With practice and traveling
vou budget your time better. My grades

are a lot better when competing. practice”
breaks up the day. it gets my mind off‘
school work for a while." ‘

Maybe that is why she'll go outvat' l:00.
a.m. to run and “clear my head." %
“i feel like i’m always either in track or at
the library," said the indian Quad residentt
“l have a lot of pressure now. i use it to.
clear my head. Some smoke. someldrink. i"
just run. Only once in a while‘ i‘ll find time1
to party." ‘

Another notable characteristic which

Donna possesses is the constant combos:T
nion she carries around with her; H ‘V
walkman is always there. When askéd wh ..
she replied, "i think i take it with me'?
because running is really painful. [distract-
myself from thinking about the pain."

Unfortunately injury is constantly.!
creeping up. “i hate being injured." ‘she
says. “ i complain a lot. Seeing others go
to practice is awful. it's hard to sit out. i
don’t feel like i've ever been in the best
shape 1 could get in. We never hit my
potential because every time i'm on my
way to top shape i get stress fractures.
Whenever i begin to peak the season
ends."

“i don’t think yet We found the event
i‘m good at." said Burnham. “i think my
race now is the mile. i have the endurance
but not enough for a 5 or 10k. ihave speed
but not enough for a mo yard dash. i guess
i have most of my ability running the mile
outdoors."

As for the future. Donna is certain she'll
continue ‘to run. After graduation. she
plans to compete in road races and
trinthnlons. She is currently applying to
dentul and medical schools.

Goals for the upcoming season include
improving her "bad attitude" toward
truck and working on a more positive one.
Competing in the mile at the NCAA Divi-
sion iii nationals is also a dream. A dream
that is deflnltelyn possibility. l‘J‘
