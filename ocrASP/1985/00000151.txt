 highwschool wore on,

 

March a, .1985. V ”

H t's all a matter of how you look at
I things," Alex would explain. it was

clear that he‘ knew what he was ~

talking about and he would try to say it
without being arrogant. Math teachers
really loved it when he would raise his
hand in the middle of a lesson and point
out that the clrcumference of a circle
doesn’t always equal 2 r or'that the sum of
the angles of a triangle can be more than
180 degrees. l usually couldn't follow it but
he sure did put on a_'fshow.‘ There were

times when he would<debate with the.»
teacher for a whole class period, throwing

in "Einstein" here or “relativity” there.
They really loved it. So did i. ‘

Joel Jaffe

in fact, there was a lot about Alex l real-
ly loved. He first came to my attention
back‘when we were both starting high
school. We didn't know each other then
but we were in a few of the same classes
together. He always seemed to be the
center of attention. There. were people
around him constantly, usually laughing or
just having a good time. I swear, he must
have known a couple ‘of hundred people
and had dozens of clo§e_frjends. He was
really quite a phenomenon: What 1 ad-
mired most about him was his apparent
lack of inhibitions. He always seemed to be
open and easy going, but he was also very
intelligent. ‘He would talk to the teachers

 

 

more as an equal than a student. And they I

seemed quite ready. to accept this. I believ-
ed him to be one of a kind then, in some

ways i still do. He didn't know me, but i"

sure knew him. He was the person l’d
always wanted to be -- smart, witty,
popular; ' 0 _ ‘
There’ Was more to him than that. As

When we finally‘inet‘" he 'openly ,welcom-
ed me as a friend. That was a magic mo-
ment. He really surprised me. I’d wanted to ,
be the guy he would hang out With, not

_ just so other people would see, but-became
‘ i felt a strong attraction to his inoffensive
' confidence. What caught me off guard was

 

that he made a stronger effort to be near
me than i did to him. This really impressed
me. i soon became part of his inner circle,
meeting after school and on weekends.
We'd usually just go to someone’s house or
to a movie, but everyone always'had‘ a
good time. Those meetings were carefree
and full of fun. Sometimes i mix them.

"Maybe it's time to redefine our concept
of God." The philosophy'teacher looked
up when Alex said this. "i mean, if we’re
talking factually, then none of the gods in
any religion can really exist. After all,
they’re all surrounded by legends of the

‘ . ‘ xx ' .-

' ‘and‘a half bllliorf people on Earth."

supernatural. . .and if we make the
reasonable assumption that nothing super-
natural has ever_ happened,‘ then clearly
these gods must be. . .fictitious. i would

many with nature. . .And since nature is
the force that keeps order in the universe,
God could quite easily be nature
itself. . .which would be all-embracing and
still consistent with reality. . .hmm, it
doesn't leave much room for an afterlife,
does it?" i l:  ,

We were in the middle of eleventh
grade then, and by which time we’d
become best friends. in the year and a half
since we'd met, the emphasis of our con-
versations had shifted from humor to in-'
sight but they were no less enjoyable. lt

out who Alex was. What i found seemed
to contradict my first impression, but
despite that, it only increased the awe I felt

highly thoughtful person. His opinions and
beliefs were so well constructed that it was
pretty obvious that he’d spent quite some
, time- working them out. The day he

lunch together. .
"i don't know," he started. "It seemed to
me that we always call God ‘He’ but if you
think about it, that really excludes women.
A real God's got to be universal. 'He' can’t
discriminate. He probably would be
shapeless and soundless if ’He‘ exists at all."
Other times, his insights

« argu'rn'ents but just statements of fact.
“Y'know people have a hard time with
numbers. i mean, if i say that one person
“got‘killed in a car crash, you feel bad. But if
a hundred people die in a plane crash, yoii
don't feel a hundred times as bad. People
can’t understand large numbers anyway.

“It's really amazing that if you go back
“far. enough, every living thing is related.
1 That bird over there is your cousin, and so
; is that tree, and the bugs and the fish, and
all the other animals and plants too. i guess
that means every man is your brother.”

Of all our different conversations, the
ones i liked most were the ones where he
did some speculating. I was fascinated by
the way someone so grounded in facts also
managed to have a spiritual side. Not
spiritual in a religious way, but more like
spiritual in a hopeful way.

"Alex, d'you ever wonder about the
future?" '

"’Sure. . sometimes.”

“Do you think we'll end up killing
ourselves?” V

"Maybe. l hope not. We can do it, you

 

know. But I like to think that man will go

   

in his presence. For one thing, he was a'

on to become something really great
someday."

“You mean like evolution, far down the
line?"

"Sortof. i don’t know. it’s just that l've
always felt that each person has his own lit~

we’ll find a way to ignite it. Who knows?”

"Oh, you can't really mean 'divinity'.
After all there‘s no exact definition of the
word. Maybe you mean that there’ll come
a day when we‘ll all be good people."

“Could be. But the romantic side of me
would like humanity to gain. . .enlighten-
ment. . .and omnipotence. . .and to go out
into the universe. You know, that sort of
thing." '

"Well. . .“

"Remember that day in Philosophy
when i tried to redefine God?"

. "Yeah."

"Well maybe we should redefine ’Man'
too. i mean take someone like Einstein. He
found a whole new way of looking at
things. A whole new point of view. if he
didn’t do it, it's possible no one else would
have."

"i don’t know much about Einstein."

“Doesn’t matter. What l’m saying is that

something. a, new way of understanding
Ourselves and our world, then doesn’t that
signify. . .progress?"

Eleventh grade ended. Senior year was
quickly sliding away. Alex would be going
to Yale. it made me feel bad to think that
'we wouldn't be able to see each other. in
all the time since we’d met, i kept learning
new things about him until, at last, l was
pretty sure there was nothing i didn't

f know. But true to form, Alex managed to
surprise me again. He called me up after
school one day and told me he was alone at
home and needed someone to talk to. l

' understood this; being alone in a big house

' drove me crazy. But then he asked me if [d
ever felt. . .alone and empty. i said i had. i

'heard a quiet sigh- then asked if he was

alright. . .was he feeling depressed'l. 'He
assured me he wasn't -- that he just needed
someone to talk to. Before i could say
anything, he started telling me i was the
fonly person he could really talk to. . .be

funny. l‘d always thought of Alex as being
unfaltering, with nothing'to hide. For the ,
next two hours he rambled on tonic about
the pressure he was under, the, oppor-
tunities he’d lost, his difficulties in relating
to others, his problems letting his feelings
show, and about his sexual frustrations.
When he had just about exhausted
himself, l cut In and told him to relax. i said
that of all the people l knew, he showed his
problems less than anybody, And that l’d
always admired his freedom. . .not to men-

 

tlon the fact that he knew more girls than

tle spark of divinity and maybe someday ‘

if someone can find a newlapproach t0"

,honest about his feelings. it was kind of ’

 

 

 

 

most guys around. i told him that there
were times i wished l were him. A silence
' followed. Finally he said, "You'regkidding"
' and i told him i wasn't. After some
soothing conversation, he told me how
good l'd made him feel, i said that ttﬁat's
what friends are for then asked again if he
was feeling okay. I ’
"Don't worry, l'm not cracking up_ or
anything‘ but We never felt like I had
anyone i could really spill my guts to. ljust
needed to let it out."
"i know what you mean."
He laughed. "Don't waste your time
glorifying me--we're already the same after
all.”

When it was over, i never looked at
Alex the same way. We got to admit it was
refreshing to find he wasn't really God-
like. l'lthink it made me like him all the
more to find out that despite all his
"presence" he was just as normal as
everyone else. '

Alex never made it to Yale. He was hit
by a truck while crossing the street. i went
to his funeral. The summer sun really did a
job that day. l stood there sweating in my
suit looking around at everyone else when
something very strange occurred to me. i
realized that Alex was right. A lot does de-
pend on your point of view. His father
must have seen him one way, his mother
another, and his little sister still another.
His friends and relatives must have seen
him differently too. And metl wasn’t sure
what to think.

i made my way over to the open casket.
You know how you hear that when people
die they look kind of like they're resting?
Not Alex. He looked very dead. . .so pale
and lifeless. Then all of a sudden, i felt a
great emptiness, a terrible sense of loss.
Something hopelessly irreplaceable had
been taken away and the world should be
mourning. There were a, million things l
yearned to say to him, but when l knealt
over the coffin i saw his blank face looking
up, mocking me--telling me, “it’s too late
now. . .Your'rc too late." My eyes heavy, I
looked to the wind to catch a glimpse of his
soul. I prayed he was wrong about God
and the after life.

There are still so many things i haven't

ementioned. So many things. i guess it

would really be ‘imposslble to do him

'iustice. i know he never: got famous or
;anything but he did add some life to this

world. Sometimes i think I can see him in
the clouds or at the horizon. it's funny in a
way. When i think of him like that, i don't
feel like I was just his friend but like I was
also. . .his pupil. Maybe that's it. Maybe
he's alive in me. i don't know. I guess the
important thing is that he made me look at
things in ways I never did before. . .Hcy,
isn‘t that progress? Cl
