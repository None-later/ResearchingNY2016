cher runs out, big fat feet, and turns
from his shop with his cleaver, double chin
too, and asks you “you alright?" You hold
your gut like you just lost the war, stick
your nose south to the sewer grate. Your
mouth is curled high, eyes rolled back,
knees swimming in the fish ice melt
thrown in a heap from the shop last week.
You lift your head to the thick man above.
wiping his cleavtar in a street light glint on

And in the dust that is flung, the papers
that float, the smoke that dissolves, you
stand alone with your back to a streetlight

garbage can and clutching your stomach
tight ’til sounds like sirens ring in your ears
and carry yourself to the verge of tears. And
out to the wide avenue you continue,
avoiding the cracks and mild heart attacks,
descend the steps of the subway 1ND, and
