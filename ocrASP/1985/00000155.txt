Guess which one will grow up
to be the engineer.

As things stand now, it doesn’t take much of a guess.

Because by and large, he is encouraged to excel in math and
science. She isn't.

Whatever the reason for this discrepancy, the cost to society is
enormous because it affects women‘s career choices and limits the
contributions they might make.

Only 4% of all engineers are women.

Only 13.6% of all math and science Ph.l).’s are women.

And an encouraging. but still low, 31.3% of all professional
computer programmers are women.

 

In the past ten years, IBM has supported more than 90
programs designed to strengthen women’s skills in these and
other areas. This support includes small grants for pre-college
programs in engineering, major grants for science programs
at leading women’s colleges, and grants for doctoral fellowships in
physics, computer science, mathematics, chemistry, engineering,
and materials science.

We intend to continue supporting programs like these.

Because we all have a lot to gain with men and women on
equal footing. =_=——-= =“’
