crimination), and the few positive com-
ments were lost in the article's unjust sar-
casm attd covert animosity toward the
Greek systent in general. Finally, black
Greek-letter organizations are very much
an established part of the Greek college

equal respect and consideration.

The piece is clearly slattted. An article
that devotes six paragraphs to the horrors of
hazing and one sentence to philanthropy is
hardly objective. What happened to show-

The renewed status of the Greeks on

campuses is a perfect example of tlte current

Being art active member ofthe Pi Beta Phi
Sorority at the University of Michigan, I
can assure you that this school year already
my house has been involved itt numerous
civic services to the campus and communi-
ty. My house has so far helped run the
student-government elections, hosted a
Halloween party for retarded children,
raised money for bunt victims and helped
with tags for the Humane Society. Sounds
like all we do is party, puke and cause
disturbance to our fellow neighbors, huh?
Granted that social functions are a part of
our life, but they do not take precedence
over everything. Your magazine owes the
Greek system an apology.
