LETTERS
Examining the Greek System

While I really enjoyed your article on the
“Rebirth of the Greeks" (November 1984),
I think that too much emphasis was placed
on the racial separation of the fraternity
system and not nearly enough on the college
community as a whole. The separation does
exist and it is true that blacks and whites do
not mingle, but it doesn‘t make sense to
heap the blame for racism on the Greek
system when most other campus groups are
lily white or solidly black.

DERRICK A. NOWLlN
University of Pittsburgh
Pittsburgh, Pa.

As a member of a predominantly black
sorority, I was offended by your article. It
focused on the negative aspects of Greek life
(e.g., hazing. sorority raids, drinking, dis-

crimination), and the few positive com-
ments were lost in the article‘s unjust sar-
casm and covert animosity toward the
Greek system in general. Finally, black
Greek-letter organizations are very much
an established part of the Greek college
community and deserve to be treated with
equal respect and consideration.
CORlNNE E. ARCHIE
University of Michigan
Ann Arbor, Mich.

The piece is clearly slanted. An article
thatdevotes six paragraphstothchorrorsof
hazing and one sentence to philanthropy is
hardly objective. What happened to show-
ing both sides ofthe story. NEWSWEEK?

SUSAN Nanaosxl

The Greeks are back. but so are the prob-
lems ofhazing and discrimination. I am in

 

complete agreement about the dangers of

NEWSWEEK 0N CAMPUS/MARCH l‘ltlﬁ

 

hazing (to harass, humiliate and play
pranks on, often with physical abuse), but I
feel some initiation for admission into an
organization with formal ceremonies or se-
cret rites should be allowed. Without it,
fraternities and sororities would not be
the same.
SANDRA SANTOVENA
El Paso, Texas

Even though I don‘t belong to a sorority.

I was offended by the obviously biased view

you presented of fraternities and sororities

as havens for heavy drinking, partying and

vomiting, and of Greeks thinking ofthem-

selves as “gods” whose rituals place them

high above “the rest ofus." Ifyou are biased

against the Greeks, express your opinion in

an editorial; otherwise, present both sides
and let the reader decide.

LINDA GIASSON

Ann Arbor, Mich.

Your article focused on fraternities that
have caused problems and left readers with
the impression that all fraternities are alike:
they either ﬁt the “Animal House" image or
are reforming. Was there no Greek who
spoke highly of fraternity or sorority life
as a venue for social service or lasting
friendships?

SUSAN B. LYON
University of Michigan
Ann Arbor, Mich.

The renewed status of the Greeks on
campuses is a perfect example of the current
trend in our society toward conformity and
security rather than individuality.

RACHEL PYLE
San Clemente, Calif.

Being an active member ofthe Pi Beta Phi
Sorority at the University of Michigan, I
can assure you that this school year already
my house has been involved in numerous
civic services to the campus and communi-
ty. My house has so far helped run the
student-government elections, hosted a
Halloween party for retarded children,
raised money for burn victims and helped
with tags for the Humane Society. Sounds
like all we do is party, puke and cause
disturbance to our fellow neighbors, huh?
Granted that social functions are a part of
our life. but they do not take precedence
over everything. Your magazine owes the
Greek system an apology.
