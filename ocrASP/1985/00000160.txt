with a fast-track vocational approach to
higher education. he says, tend to look
down on those pursuing broader schooling
“as second-class citizens who don't know
what the real world is about.”

Not surprisingly, students tend to see it
differently. “We keep having it drummed
into us that we‘re at the tail end ofthc baby
boom and that there might be no jobs for
us," says Elizabeth McLarney, a 21-year-
old Brown junior from Kansas City, Mo.
"You step on who you have to."

David Pickell, editor ofBerkeley's Daily
Californian, agrees, suggesting that the
growing concern with personal success has
more to do with the age oflimits than with
politics: “In the '60s, your future was guar-
anteed. The economy was in a boom, there
was no inﬂation. Mario Savio [leader of

 

too much money to support the economic
system, and that if you’re going to live in a
free society you might as well live in a free

,economic system, as well.“ In a tongue-in-

cheek gesture designed to make light ofthe
prevailing campus attitude about the GOP,
the Carleton Republicans plan to adopt as
their new logo 21 clenched ﬁst much like the
symbol of‘60s radicals—only this one will
be clutching dollar bills.

“ We grow up in a time of great uncertainty
and instability about our institutions. I think
a lot of these trials and tribulations added on
to the normal fears kids ha ve in growing up. I
think since 1980. a lot of today‘s students
have rejoiced in a feeling of security that was
lacking during our junior-high and high-
schoa/ years. For the younger port of the

shift out of physics into philosophy. Now
students feel like they don‘t have a choice.
They want something they can hang on to.
so they go right for those fast~track ﬁelds
like engineering and computer science. But
that doesn‘t make students conservative.
They could be closet conservatives or closet
liberals—nobody knows."

There are plenty of thoughtful students
whose political views and personal aspira-
tions are deeply intertwined—but they're
not easily pigeonholed politically. Many of
them have come to believe that what‘s good
for the studcntjob market is probably good
for the country as well. Jennifer l’olli. a 19-
ycar-old sophomore at Brown, says she
started considering herselfa Republican in
her freshman year. “I'm a Republican for
the long-term beneﬁts that i see they‘re
bringing to the country," she explains. "I

Mikc Singer witnessed ﬁrsthand some-
thing thc rest of the nation saw on the
evening news. As president of USC‘s Slu-
dent Scnutc, he introduced both Demo-
cratic presidential candidate Walter Mon-
dale and Republican Vice President
George Bush to the Los Angeles campus—-
and watched from the platform as Mon-
dale was loudly heckled and Bush baskcd
in approving chants of “peace through
strength.“ And as he suggests, the Repub-
lican appcnl for students during Campaign
‘84 was probably much broader than sim-
ple economics—or even simple politics. “I
would see politics as part of a general
conservative trend that manifests itself in

many things." snys Doris lictts, chair of
