Night Monsters." tlte 1966 epic

Science the Way
It Might Be

Remember all those times
you‘ve been in a science class
and had no idea what everybody
was talking about? Good. then
Tom Weller‘s “Science Made
Stupid“ (80 pages. Hung/iron
Mijﬂin. $6.95) is for you. For
example, here is how Weller ex-
plains the origins oi'astronomy:
“The ancients looked at the

heavens and saw the shapes of

gods and animals in the stars.
This was probably due to wide-
spread drug abuse in ancient
times.“ And see how Weller re-
duces a complex geologic con-
cept to an absurdly simple level:
"Volcanic et‘uctions are caused
either by a buildup of pressure
on subterranean pockets ol'mol-
ten rock. or by angering the

10M wEL rR

 

 

gods. The eruction generally
continues until the crater is
plugged by solidifying lava or
virgins." This profusely illus-
trated book—with its rare
glimpses of extinct creatures
such as the duck-billed mas-
todon—will teach you how to
build your own planetarium or
backyard nuclear reactor and
make you ridiculously—even
oll‘ensively—smart on such be-
wildering things as "ignomin-
ious. sedentary and metaphor-
ic" rocks.

Dion DiMucci
Rocks Again

For a few years in the early
'605. after Elvis and before the
Beatles. Dion DiMucci was the
very essence of white-boy cool.
On his best records—“Run-
around Sue," “The Wanderer"
and "Born to Cry.“ among oth-
ers—the Bronx-born Dion de-
ﬁned a particular kind of capi-
tal-A Attitude that kids all over
the country aspired to: cocky,
unllappable. capable of deliver-
ing on every boast—and doing
it in style. ltt real life. things
weren‘t quite so rosy for Dion.
Toward the end of the decade
the hits stopped coming. Drugs
and alcohol almost ruined him.
But Dion never lost his cool.
Adopting a folksier musical
style and a deeply religious life-
style. he held on. Today he
works in the gospel ﬁeld. where
he is a minor but steady star.

The Dion story—all ofit—is
retold on a superb new collec-

tion froth Arista Rec-

ord' “Dion/24 Original
Classics“ is a model for
everything an anthology

LP should be. All Dion's

hits are here, including

his surprising comeback

record of 1968, the gen-

tle protest ballad “Abra-

ham, Martin and John."
Mitchell Cohen‘s notes

are thorough and alfec-
tionate. but not afraid
