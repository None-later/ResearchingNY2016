release by Dion‘s group. the
Belmonts, after he left to go
solo; the song proves neatly
just how important the lead
singer‘s swaggering vocals
were. The collection ends with
three extraordinary. little-
known tracks: “Your Own
Back Yard," an unblinkittg look
inward from Dion‘s folkie days;
a live version of “The Wander-
er“ from 1972, in which a re-
united Dion and the Belmonts
joyfully wring new life from
his old hit, and a lively, hap-
py cover ofTom Waits‘s "Heart
of Saturday Night.“ Taken
wltole, tracing the career ofthis
terriﬁc singer over 20 years,
the record makes a pretty good
cascthat Dion isjust what anno-
tator Cohen claims: an Anteri-
can original.

Jazz Guitarist
Learns the Score

From free~form jazz to the
strict conﬁnes ofa ﬁlm score—
it might seem like a quantum
leap, but guitarist Pat Metltcny
doesn‘t see it that way. “We‘ve
always tried to make pictures
with the sounds,“ he says ofthe
Pat Metheny Group, whose
Itauttting abstract instrumen-
talshavelandedtwoGrantmies.
“You look at our reviews and
you see the word 'evocative‘ a
lot." So when Metheny and
writing partner Lyle Mays drew
the scoring assignment for .Toltn
Schlesinger‘s “The Falcon and
the Snowman," "the biggest ad-
justment was on a mechanical

 

level, timings and tempos and
frames per beat. It‘s a real chal-
lenging gig. You‘ve got to draw
on everything you know—
you‘ve got to be creative, you‘ve
got to come up with hip melo-
dies attd all that, plus you‘ve got
to cram it into 20 seconds if
that‘s what‘s called for."

So Metheny and Mays ad-
justed. and the result was one of
the best thittgs about this other-
wise muddled movie. The score
even yielded a popular single itt
the Metheny/David Bowie col-
laboration “This Is Not Amer-
ica." It was a nice bonus, but not
at all what Metheny set out to
accomplish. The point of scor-
ing, he says, is simply to serve
the dramatic needs of the pic-
ture. “l‘m glad to be getting

 

the chance to do this," he says.

“I love the idea of music
combined with pictures.
Writing a ﬁlm score is
like making the ultimate
rock video.“ His next
scoring job is for “Twice
in a Lifetime," a Gene
Hackman picture now
set for September re-
.lease. “But the work
with the group pleases
me too. I’m getting to
do more straight-ahead
jazz stull‘, with musi-
cians like Sonny Rollins
and Charlie Haden. lfl
wasn't getting to do any
one of those things, I‘d
feel like I was miss-
ing something. As it is, I
feel like the luckiest cat
in the world.“

Without Gloss

Sherlock Holmes has always
seemed to carry a good deal of
excess baggage when he ap-
peared on screen. It was a
screenwriter. not Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle, who coined the
phrase “Elementary, my dear
thtson." And the old movies
starring Basil Rathbone and Ni-
gel Bruce took enormous liber-
ties: Watson was mude into a
dodtlering blunderer, and the
plots were updated to pit
Holmes against ntorc modern
menaccs such as the Nazis. But
this year, through the good
gracesofl’BS, television viewers
get to see the unvarnished Sher-
lock Holmes, when seven ofthe

 

stories are broadcast as part of
the “Mystery!” series, starting
March 14(check local listings).

Often the translations are al-
most letter perfect. The begin-
ning of "A Scandal in Bolte—
mia“—“To Sherlock Holmes
she was always the woman“—
dilfers from Doyle only by the
tense of the verb. And while in
London, Holmes sports a top
hat—the famous deerstalker
model was for country wear
only. As Holmes, actor Jeremy
Brett seems to have lifted his
commanding, egocentric perso-
na straight olfthe printed page.
Conan Doyle would even be
pleased with the producers'
choice of stories: three of the
seven were among the author‘s
favorites.
