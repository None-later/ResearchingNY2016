 

HEALTH

ood health has not been a subject
G of traditional concern for college
students. For generations these
were people who slept either too a uch or
too little, exercised mainly by In. ging to
the cigarette machine in the middle ofthe
night, ate pure junk most of the time and
then lied about it to their mothers. If you
had asked yesterday's students about exer-
cise. tnaity might have responded like Clay
McNear. a 1984 graduate of Southern
Methodist who waited until his last semes-
ter to fulﬁll his physical-education require-
ment: "I ltate I’.E. I put it
oil", and I put it off because
I didn‘t want to take it.
Why take sontething you're
never going to use again?“
Why'.’ Wake up and smell

Clay. This is the ‘80s. and
sloth isn't cool anymore.
Good health is cool,
and ﬁtness facilities are
mobbed—even on college
campuses, where students
are ﬁttally leartting some
healthy habits. At Bos-
ton University, where it‘s
tough to get students to-
gether for any reason, ath-
letic director John Simpson
reports that the weight
room is “jampacked” every
day from 8 in the morning
to 10 at night. Just up the
subway‘s Green Line at
Boston College. 1.500 stu-
dents and faculty use the
athletic-recreation building
every day. Arid at Cal Poly
in Salt Luis Obispo. Jim Railey, head of
physical education. calls his campus “ﬁt-
ness crazed. You cart get run over by
joggers any time of the day or night. Our
racquetball courts are busy until 4 am.“
According to a NEWSWEEK ON CAMPUS
Poll. almost 80 percent of college students
now make a special elI‘ort to exercise every
week: running is by far the most popular
activity. followed by weight training. \valk-
ing and swimming. Halfofthose who don‘t
exercise regularly plan to start working out
in the next year. Only 26 percetit ofcollege
studertts smoke cigarettes—signiﬁcantly
lower than the national average of 38 per-
cent—and 7 out of 10 students who smoke
want to quit. Students have come to real-
ize that “you can‘t just concentrate on
your mind and let your body fall apart."
says Steve Cooper, a senior architecture
major at the University ofTexas. “Il'you‘re
physically ﬁt and you have a good diet,

Phys. Ed. Shapes Up

Students discover good health and ‘wellness’ courses.

you'll feel better and think better, too.“

To take advantage of the new collegiate
health cortsciousness, malty schools are re-
tailoring their phys.-ed. offerings. Boring,
repetitive calisthenics are being banished
in favor of training for "wellness," a life-
long regimen of regular exercise and good
nutrition. At California‘s Pepperdine (site
of the annual “Battle of the Network
Stars“), every student is required to take
TIE. IOO, Aerobics and Lifetime Fitness.
“We do have some students who think
they are going to get beautiful women in

leotards doing gyrations to music," says
George S. Poole. director of physical edu-
cation. Irtstcad, they get tested at the Hu-
man Performance Lab. Technicians give a
battery of examinations, including skin-
fold and blood-pressure tests and measure-
ntents ofbody fat to lean body mass. There
are lectures. and a written midterm and
ﬁnal. (“We've thought about maybe
changing the name of the course.“ Poole
says.) Three exercise classes are also re-
quired, although the university does its
best to make them palatable: scuba. sailing,

golfand sut'ling all qualify.

A Gill’ord, the emphasis has switched
toindividualsportsoractivities that

graduates can practice forever. “Ten years

ago we had a lot ofteam sports; now we lntve

three or four aerobics classes which didn‘t

exist." Gill'ord says. “We ltavernorcjogging

t SMU. says RTE. chairman Peter

 

 

classes, and we have yoga classes that teach
relaxation technique." The school is also
considering adding a corporate-ﬁtness spe-
cialty within its RE. major, a nod to the 50
percent ofSMU phys.-ed. majors who plan
to take their training to the business world.

Phys-ed. requirements were dropped at
many colleges during the do-your-own-
thing ‘605 and ‘705. Now those programs
are often voluntary, creating what is in ef-
fect a buyers‘ market, and P.E. departments
are trying to tempt participants with a wide
range of activities. About one—fourth of
the student body at Drake University in
Iowa, for instance, takes classes in every-
thing from swimming to bowling to tae
kwon do. Drake also hopes to add a wellness
course, says RE. Prof. Raymond Pugh,
“something that would take a look at the

total ‘you'—wltat you eat. what you drink,
if you put tobacco ittto your system."

One ofthe pioneers in the wellness move-
ment was Pennsylvania‘s Bryn Mawr. Initi-
ated in I982. Bryn Mawr‘s program has
three parts. The ﬁrst is exercise—one gym
course picked from a battery of aerobically
oriented activities. plus a “personal-ﬁtness
schedule." which provides a sampling of
different drills. The second component is
ttutrition—oﬁ‘ering students a computer-
ized diet analysis at the start of the term
and. it) tandem with a nutritionist, design-
ing balanced menus. Finally, the school's
health service participates when neces-
sary—counseling students with stress. di-
etary problems or serious disorders. A re-

ferral to the health service, though. is a ‘

last resort. “We have really emphasized
self-respousibility.“ says coordinator Leigh
Donato. "I don't want to be the reason Jane
