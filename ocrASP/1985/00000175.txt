ing with her after the end of the semester."
The wellness program is secure at Bryn
Mawr (the school picked up funding this
year after a three-year foundation grant ran
out) if it‘s not yet ﬂourishing. Only a tiny
fraction ofthe college‘s students choose the
rigorous wellness option over routine phys.
ed.—6O last year versus more than L600.
That‘s why the administrators‘ next goal is
expansion. Donato and P.E. director Jen-
epher Shillingford want to make the pro-
gram mandatory for all freshmen starting
next fall. They are also planning an East
Coast wellness conference in the summer of
1986 to spread the word. Even these cham-
pions of wellness allow, though, that the
most crucial changes—in attitude as well as
in habit—are often the hardest to achieve.
“Sometimes we hit brick walls," Donato
sighs. Those students who persevere, how-
ever, cite several rewards. Bryn Mawr soph-
omore Katie Steinmetz enrolled last year to
help manage stress and improve her la-
crosse game. She achieved both—and more.
uNow I realize that ﬁtness is something you
do for yourself," Steinmetz says. “Before,
fitness was something I had to do. Now it's
something I want to do."
