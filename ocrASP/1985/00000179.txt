Fraud hurts banks

Washington. DC.
(AP) US. banks lost an estimated $70
million to $100 million front fraudulent
use of automated teller machines in 1983.
with customers forfeiting millions frotn
lost or stolen access cards. the government
said.

Banks suffered the bulk of the losses.
however. as custotners were able to limit
their liability quickly by reporting missing
or stolen cards. the Bureau of Statistics
said Sunday.

Overall. approximately $262 billion was
processed through some 43.800 automated
teller tttachincs installed itt banks in 1983.
The bureau arrived at its $70 million to
$100 million figure by comparing the $262

billion total to the ratio of fraud losses in ’

Women falter in State promotions

By ‘Johanna Clancy

Women and minority men appear to be
well represented among those receiving
non-permanent promotions in New York
State Government. but were under-
represented in permanent managerial ap-
pointments said a study released in
February by the Center for Women in
Government.

According to the study “Alternative
Routes of Promotion in New York State."
conducted by the Center's Director of
Research and implementation Dr. Cynthia
Chertos, seventy percent of non-appointed
managerial promotions in New York State
government between i977 and 1980 were
made through alternative routes such as
administrative transfers and non-
competitive promotions rather than the
traditional examination process.

The study was based on an analysis of
1.381 individual promotions in the
managerial ranks of 16 state agencies and
was funded through a grant from the
Robert Sterling Clark Foundation. '

Secretary of State and president of the
Center's Board Gail Shaffer said the board
was “surprised” that seventy percent of
the non-appointed managerial promotions
were made through alternative routes. Of
this seventy percent. 63.9 percent were
non-permanent appointments and only 6.1
percent were permanent. she said.

“New York State is concerned about the
under-representation of women and
minority men at the managerial levels of
government employment." Shaffer said
adding, “We first realized the importance
of alternative routes of managerial promo-
tion while studying the impact of the tradi-
tional examination prodess."

 

 

 

“Women and
minority men did not
receive the number of
these promotions that
one would expect...”

-—-Cynthia Cherros

 

Women and minority men, along with
white men, were equitably represented in
receiving non-permanent promotions said
Chertos. but these appointments are less
desirable than permanent appointments.
"While non-permanent appointments may
provide a ‘foot in the door.‘ they do not
provide a vested right to continued
employment or a right to further promo-
tional opportunity." site said.

“The alternative routes of promotion
offer a great measure of ﬂexibility,” Natt-
‘cy Perlman executive director of the
Ccttter asserted. “Wltile this ﬂexibility is
ttot ittherently good or bad for the system,
or for tire employees who work irt it. what
matters is how the ﬂexibility is used. It can
be used to reinforce sex attd race segrega-
tion; it can be used equitably for all
employees. or it can be used as an affir-
rttative action tool."

Perlman said, “We recommend that this
ﬂexibility be balanced with accountability
to ensure that alternative ntehanisms are
used without preference.“ She added. I‘ln‘
an effort to increase the numbers of
women and minority managers. alternative
routes should be used for affirntativc
action.“

Actording to Chertos. “Women and
tttirtority ntett did ttot receive the number
of these promotions tltat one would expect
based upon their proportion of the State
managerial work force." In addition. said
Chertos. "Women and minority ntcn were
ttot promoted through the full range of
alternative routes.“

The Center recommended publication of
a manual outlining all promotion
mechanisms. It also suggested that efforts
be made to increase the eligibility of
women and ntinority men for managerial
prontotion. 2"]

RAs on Indian form intereSt group

By James O'SUIIIVan
News Editor

Residence Assistants on Indian Quad
have formed a Student Association
recognized group to provide a forum for
RA gripes and suggestions, but one
University official has already told group
members that they could be fired if they at—
tempt to use “union tactics” to try and get
changes made in the systgm.

The group. called Coalition of Resident
Assistants. has met three times so far. ac-
cording to RA Joe Fusco, but is only in the
beginning stages of discussion and so is not

pressing for ay immediate changes. He'

also said the group is seeking to include
RAs from other quads.

Several members of the group met with
Residential Life Director John Martone
late last Friday afternon. according to
Fusco. who said that Martone expressed
disapproval of the group's methods.
specifically in their going outside of the
department. “It was an interesting discus-
sion. no ﬂattering tltings were said."
Fusco said.

“His (Mnrtone's) exact quote was ‘if
you use any labor union tactics. you will
no longer be with 'staff,‘ " said RA Kevin
Kohn. who attended the meeting.

Kohtt. who called the statement u threat.
said that CORA wanted only to work with
the department to better define the RA
position for future RA's. and added. “for
him to make a comment like that was

‘ totally uncalled for."

Murtone, who did not deny making the
statement. said he would have preferred
that the group work within the existing
Residential Life structure. rather titan
form n group independent of the
department.

“i felt the way they went about it was lit-
upproprlate." he added. saying that the
RA: could have gone to either the
Residence Directors or Area Coordinator
if they had problems with the existing
forunt. the RA Advisory Board.

The RA Advisory Board. set up this
year. is composed of two RAs front each

 

quad and a staff person from Residential
Life. Patty Snyder. “When sometiting was
brought up to Advisory Board. it would
get caught up in the red tape." said Kohn.

Kohn said that last semester the RAs
had requested ID. cards to prove to
students who they were when making
rounds each night. After two months. he
said. they were issued, “a piece of paper
with a stamp on it and five options."
which could be circled to show the benrer's
position.

CORA is“ working to
make conditions
better for the future
RA ’5 and future

Staf '. ”
—Aileen Brown

 

“This is just one of the things we felt
very strongly about," he said.

Snyder was not available to eomtttettt
Monday, but Murtone said the topic of
Advisory Board had been broached at the
Friday meeting. but no problents were
reported to him. He also said that no
representatives from Indian Quad had
been at the last board meeting.

RA Aileen Brown stressed that the
group was not seeking a confrontation
with the University. “1 really don't think
that was the viewpoint of the group." she
said.

instead, she said CORA wanted to
spend its time "working to make condi-
tions better for the future RAs and future
' staff." She noted that fewer people apply
to be RAs on Indian each year. ttttd said
that us a resttlt."thc quality of the RA
stuff will go down."

Brown said that CORA did not intend to
take any actions such as work stoppages.
or ever go on strike. "We don't want to
make any enemies or step on any toes."

Two issues CORA members had discuss-

ed. Brown said. were rennmeration and a
more specific definition of the RA posi-
tion. She said that in addition to single
room cost waivers and the hook-up and
local phone service expenses, RAs receive a
$125 stipend each semester. She also said
the amount of the stipend hadn't gone up
in seven years.

Fusco said that CORA members wanted
to work in conjunction with Residential
Life. and mentioned the possibility of RAs
lobbying legislators in favor of increased
stipends. if SUNYA officials proposed it
during the budget process.

“it‘s well within our rights as citizens. to
attempt to get together. . .and by exercis-
ittg those rights we don't feel in the least
way that we're threatening anyone else."
he added.

CORA members have sought legal atl-
vice.said Kohn. adding that most of the
consultations had been on art informal
basis with parents of RAs who happened
to be lawyers. He also said the group has
contacted the New York Civil Liberties
Union to try and determine if any constitu-
tional rights of RAs had been violated.

"1 view RAs as at the very least quasi-
administrators.“ said Vice President for
University Affurs Frank Pogne. adding
that he does not consider RAs to be a stu-
dent organization.

He said their job is “to assist the
Residential Life stuff. so that I do not view
the RAs as a seperutc entity frorn the ad-
ministrative functions of the University.“
Pogue added that there are otiter methods
the RAs could httve used to express their
concerns.“l believe that the channels are
there."

Student Association Vice President Suzy
Auletta disagreed. saying that although
RAs are employed by the Uttlversity. they
are also students because they attend
classes and student functions.

“it looks like a good idea. having been
an RA thyself i can see the reason for It."
she said. adding that the administration
should give CORA a chance before oppos-
ing them. [,1

Gorbachev to”,
head Kremlin
after death

of Chernenko

Moscow
(AP) Mikhail S. Gorbachev. a member
of the ruling Politburo. was named
Monday to replace the late Konstantin
U. Chernenko as general secretary of
the Communist Party. Tass announced.

"Mikhail Gorbachev was unanimous-
ly elected general secretary of the Com-
muttist Party at an extraordinary
plenum of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union
that was held today," an announcement
on Russian-language Tass said.

At 54. Gorbachev is the youngest
member of the ruling Politburo and his
appointment ntarks the first step in a
transition of power from the “old
guard" of the Kremlin to a youttger
generation of leaders.

His appointment was surprisingly
swift. cotning just over four hours after
Clternenko's death was announced to
the Soviet public and the world.

The first indication that Gorbachev
might be picked came when Soviet
authorities attrtounced that he would
ltead tltc funeral commission for
Chernenko. who is to be buried itt Red
Square on Wednesday. He died on Sun-
day at age 73.

The choice of Gorbachev was ttot a
surprise. “is positioning in the Polit-
buro lineup during public events itt re-
cent montlts had led Western diplomats
to label ltittt the Kreittlin's No. 2 man.

Gorbachev is expected also to be nam-
ed Soviet president. but that must be
dotte by the Supreme Soviet. the na-'
tional parliament.

Chernenko. a party activist for 55
years. had finally reached the pinnacle
of Moscow power last year. bttt only as
an elderly attd feebled figureltead. He
governed a ntere l3 ntottths. shortest
tenure of any Kremlin chief.

He died at 7:20pm Sunday “after a
grave illness." the Soviet government
announced Monday. more tltatt 18
hours after his death. It later said em-
physema. complicated by lteart and liver
ailments. was the cause of death.
Chernenko had been known to be suf-
fering front respiratory problems.

The ruddy-faced, white-haired
Chernenko, whose ill health had kept
ltitn frotn public view for weeks at a
time. was the third Kremlin chief to die
in a little tttore titan two years. part of a
revolving-door succession that has corn-
plicatcd U.S.-Soviet relations.

The attnouncetttettt of his death came
on the eve of the resumption of
U.S.-Soviet ttuclear arms-control talks
itt Geneva. Switzerland. It may at least
tetttporarily hold up progress itt the
negotiations. during a transition to new
Moscow leadership. But the Geneva
delegations announced their discussions
would open as scheduled Tuesday.

Soviet citizens. who historically have
tltronged by the tens of thousands of
pay last respects to their leaders. will be
able to view the body Tuesday and
Wednesday morning in the Hall of Col-
utntts of the House of Unions. just
across front the Kremlin's towering red-
brick walls.

The Wltite House said it was too early
to say whether Reagan. Vice President
George llnslt or some other dignitary
would lead tltc U.S. delegation to the
funeral.

“Not too long before his passing
away. President Chernenko expressed
his hope for further good development
of Sino-Soviet relutions....We hope that
these positive tendcneies itt Sine-Soviet
relations will further develop.“ said a
Foreign Ministry statement telepho‘rae'd
