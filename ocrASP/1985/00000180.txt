4 ALBANY STUDENT PRESS El ruissbA Y. MARCH

Escort services are often ignored, short-lived

Corvallis. Oregon
(College Press Service)ln the spr-
ing of 1980. a sophmore woman
was raped near Oregon State
University’s Kerr Library. The
next day. 20 Finley Hall
volunteers organized an escort
service to help women make it
across campus safely.

Today. the service is gone. Few
people know it existed.

About 30 miles north of here.
University of Oregon female
students, outraged and frightened
by a rape on the campus last Oc-
tober. will launch their new escort
service in a week or two.

The object, explained Laura
Romano of Oregon’s Women's
Referral and Resource Service, is
to make female escorts available
and, of course. to prevent future
sexual assaults.

But if the experiences of dozens
of other campuses over the last
year are any indication.
Romano’s service has only slim
chances of survival.

While many campuses, prepar-
ing for the increased night traffic
of warmer weather. are now for-
ming escort scrvicesx. the services
in general don’t work well. Most
don‘t last more titan a few mon-
ths, are usually ignored by carn-
pus women. attd often don‘t pre-
vent sexual assattlts anyway, cam-
pus police around the country
say.

 

 

 

...\l‘T ...'.'

“Generally volunteer services
don’t work very well,” observed
Daniel P. Keller. police chief at
the University of Louisville and
head of the nationwide Campus
Crime Prevention Programs.

“Right after a rape or sexual
assault, everyone comes out of
the woodwork." he explained.
“They want to help, but the inci-
dent fades. and they lose
interest."

At the nation’s biggest campus,
Ohio State. three escort services
typically go begging for people to
escort, despite 62 assaults and ten
rapes in the area last fall.

“We get maybe five calls a
night," said Cindl Butler. who
staffs one of the services.

At the University of Wiscon-
sin's Reuter Hall, which began a
service after a l980 series of sex-
ual assaults, “we get maybe five
calls a night." noted Jim
Whitland. the program's director.
“We’re starting to advertise,
make commercials. in hopes that
it'll pick up." he said.

The University of Maryland-
College Park reported six rapes
and 23 assaults in l983, and cam-
pus police expect a variety of
escort services didn‘t itnprovc the
198-3 statistics.

volunteers, and they lack the fun-
ding. they‘re iffy."

“We’ve had escort services
over the years. but. as with
everything else you have to work
at. people get tired. bored. and
the thing falls apart." said opera-
tions officer Richard Gould of
Oregon State’s defunct service.
His department provides an
escort service. he added. “but
they (students) have to call. l'd
say that we get maybe one call per
night. and that’s an average."

But OSU, with nearly 3,000
female students living on campus,
needs an. escort service, Gould
maintained. Campus police in-
vestigated lO'sexual assaults last
year. a ﬁgure Gould says is high.

A sense of immunity often
keeps students from eating.

“Oh. you hear stories of people
being chased across the campus."
said freshman Tabatha Somer-
ville. “But it's never happened to
me."

"There seems to be a problem
with lack of interest in the pro-
gram." noted Greg Colucci of
Kent State‘s now-folded escort
service. “People just don’t want
to get involved.”

Programs with full-time paid
coordinators scent to do better,
Louisville‘s Keller said.

“What l‘ve done is divide the
campus into eight main sectors

‘Night Watch“ and it's ltighly

Sexual assaults fell nearly 100
percent in the first nine months of
1984 from the same period in
l983. although Keller added the
number may be misleading.

“Most incidents of rape con-
cern people who know each
other. ‘date rape.‘ and conse—
quently are never reported."
Keller warned. “That 100 percent
drop only represents ‘stranger,
forced rapes.’ "

While volunteer escort services
continue. many merge with other
campus organizations or are
swallowed by campus ' police
departments.

occur."

Louisville‘s Keller I said
volunteer escort services will

Don’t Walk Alone resumes
bringing expanded service

By Robert Simon -.

The Don’t Walk Alone escort
service has resumed operations as
of March 3 with sortie changes in
its services and is “doing really
well" according to its new coor-
dinator Cheryl Oransoff.

The service was suspended at
the mid of last semester due to the
resignation of its previous
coordinator.

The new Don’t Walk Alottc
now offers student volunteer
escorts to anywhere on the up-
town campus rathcr than just to
the library or the quads.

Don't Walk Alone is continu-
ing to operate ottt of the library.
which is where Oransoff said a
majority of students want an
escort. “it seems that the middle
of the week between ten and
eleven is the busiest time.” she
said.

Students cart also call the Don't
Walk Alone office from 8 p.m. to
“:30 p.m. Sunday to Thursday.
said Oransoff and an escort team
will meet theta and take them
wherever they want to go.

Last semester. volunteers were
also stationed in the quad tower
lobbies. but tltcy discontinued it
this semester because. of the 600
students escorted. 560 were frotn
the library.

According to Oransoi‘f. four
volunteers are stationed in the
library each night and four addi-
tiottal volunteers are stationed in
the office to take incoming calls
for escorts.

Escorts work ill teams of two
people. one of which is always a
female. “We really need women
volunteers," said Oransoi‘f, who
explained. “We have a lot of male
applications we have to hold
because there are no women to
match them up with.“

Don't Walk Alone volunteers
are required to submit applica-
tions arid a check is made with
campus security anti university
judicial board, according to

Oransbff, who added that several
fraternitiesam participating in
Don’t Walk Alone ,as part of
Community Service.
Oransoffalso stressed that they

are trying to get more faculty in-' ,

voived. “We’re here for the
university community." she said.
“not just students. if faculty are
here for late night meetings. they
should know we have the ser—
vice.“ site added.

Don’t Walk Alone is Student
Association recognized. but they
are not funded by SA. although
Oransoff said the organization
would be intereStcd in getting SA
funding. Currently the service is
operating through funds from
Unviersity Auxiliary Services and
the administration, she said.

Oransoff is a graduate student
attd is in charge of overseeing
operations for Don‘t Walk
Alone. The position is stipended,
although Oransoff declined to
comment on the exact figures.

Every escort is provided with a
Don‘t Walk alone button which
they must wear while they are on
duty and a Don’t walk Alone T-
shirt. “We‘re getting a good
response,” Oransoff reported.
adding that students have been
approaching volunteers to ask for
an escort rather than the
volunteers approaching them.

“it‘s important to promote
safety on campus," Oransoff
said. strcssing that Don‘t Walk
Alone acts “mostly as a deter-
rant“ to dangerous situations.

Don't Walk Alone is planning
more publicity. said Oransoff
through booktnarks and table
tags as well as letters to different
SA groups. Regular office hours
have also been established Mon-
day i‘rom 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m..
and ‘l‘hursday and Friday from 9
run. to l p.m. The number to call
for an escort Sunday through
Thursday from 8 p.m. to 11:30
p.m. is 457-82l7 Cl

The Bhakti Yogi Club, a cam- ~
pus group afﬁliated with the ln-
ternational Society for Krishna
Consciousness. has resurfaced on '
campus after'a one-year hiatus.
"We were’askcd by friends to
return." said Janaka Dasa, the
spiritual leader of the group.

The group; which is- | SA.
recognized. holds their ‘meetings

interested in it." _ K 3 , . x

The group has met with with a
variety of reactions. Asaid Dasa,
explaining that it has a reputation
as a cult. “To calla 5.000 year old.
religion a cult is a diversionary
argument. in other words. if i can
drag someone else down. then i
can feel secure about my own
position." . ’

“There is no pressure to join. it
starts with the person who wants
to be the devotee.” explained
Dasa. “The impetus lies with that.
person. The logic of the
Bhagavad Gita. the holy book. is.
the attraction. if there is an act of
coercion, blame Krishna. He’s the
one who is the preacher and peo-
ple are attracted to Him."

Jay Kellman. Executive Direc:
tor of the Jewish Campus Com-.
mission and member of the
Chapel House staff. disagreed
with Dasa‘stating that the inter-
national Society for Krishna Con-
sciousness has a reputation for
“Luring students into their
organization and retreats. This
group- advertises under Bhakti

‘ Yoga Club rather than a name in-

dicating a relationship with the
Krishna movement for example."

Dasa said he' would like to
change the name to Krishna Yoga

'Club. bttt due to “bureaucratic”

reasons a name change now is
unfeasible. “All our adver-
tisements say Bhakti Yoga Club,"
he explained. Bhakti means devo-
tion to God, Dasa said adding

that he does not “understand all ’

the qus asbout us: There are only
2-3.000 devotees in the U.S. — a
very small number." ' ’

verified Dasa's figures stating.

that “their numbers have drop-i

the early l980’s when the Space

were sent to “hawk” bumper
