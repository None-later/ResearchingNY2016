born of ignorance or fee
.. Spread homophobia acceptance

. By Keith Feltman

Many myths have sprung up-
over the years about homosex-
uality. These, as with many other
kinds of myths. have been born
out.of ignorance. fear. and a

desire to: separate from the-

main,streem_’ and identify those in-
dividuals _ 'who

are supposedly 

different from

the- .accepted  Us
norm. The con-

sequence of the

spread of these myths is a deepen-
ing of the fear of homosexuality;
also known as HOMOPHOBIA.
in order to begin to cut through
the veil of ignorance surrounding
homosexuality. this columnist
will attempt to expose some of the
myths of homosexuality.

First. let us look at the word
homosexual - HOMOSEXUAL.
it is not a- dirty word. it is OK to
say it out loud and in mixed com-
pany. The words GAY and LES-
BIAN can also be used without
fear of offending all but the most
conservative right-wingers.
Please. the llvords faggot. fern.
queer, fairy. ﬁdyke. bulld‘yke. lcz-
zie and a ho‘ of other terms are
offensive. ab sive. and are poor
choices when talking about or to
same sex oriented persons. They
also reflect quite poignantly on
the mentality of the person using
them.

Do you think that you can spot
a person who is same sex oriented
simplyiby the way they look. the
clothes they wear. how their hair

is cut. or the friendsthey have? if » -

you do then you may be correct
sometimes. but odds are you will
be incorrect most of the time. Can
one tell who is a virgin. a

' vegetarian, a biology major. or a

stickball player. simply by

Independent Puerto Rican state eyed

By Charles A. Coon

Citing human rights viola-
tions and corporate rape. the
Puerto Rican, independence
Solidarity Alliance (PRISA)
end the Democratic Socialists
of America (DSA) joined
forces last Wednesday night in
a discussion aimed at helping to
achieve Puerto Rico’s freedom
from U.S. colonialism and to
fight for their right of self-
determination.

PRISA's Miguel Gomez and
‘BSA members said. they see a
.change in Puerto Rico’s
political structure as the lever
needed forisocial change. ‘

Puerto Rico, Gomez said. is
“just another market for the
U.S. to invest in." similar to
Hawaii. Korea and South
Africa. The structural ques-
tions to be asked. he said. are.
“What happens to a colonized
people to make them get up
and take their independence?
What happens In peoples minds
that makes them content with
the current situation?"

Oomcz said “he advocates
no Puerto Rican participation
in the U.S. system. that
socialism Is the most just kind
of structure." He said he
favors “a unique kind of
socialism for each situation.
each time more just, more
better." .

' According to a PRISA
newsletter. Puerto Rico must

   

 

observation?‘ y _
Clays and lesbians come in all
shapes, sizes. and races. They

'span the globe nationally and

culturally. They are involved in
all vocations from hairdresser to
'pro football player to coal miner
to physician. and most of the time

one would never know that they,
. are same sex oriented unless one

asks. -
One question that people have

been wrongly answering for a,

long time is : “What causes

‘homosexualityr' The answers

that people have given‘ range from
the domineering mother theory to
brain damage. with “he got hurt

_by a girl" and “she hates men"

thrown in the middle. The simple
truth of the matter is theat
nobody has formulatede con-
clusive theory on why. when.
where.” or how a person is
homosexual. Some things are cer-
tain. Homosexuality is not a
disease. One does not “get it"
from living with or just talking to

I a gay person. Homosexuality ex

ists whether or not children are
exposed to homosexuals.
Remember. most homosexual
adults were raised in households
with heterosexual parents and
with siblings who are heterosex-
ual. Also. most homosexuals were
raised in environments where
homosexuality was either frown-
ed upon or not dealt with. Conse-

quently. one cannot say that-‘

homosexuality is caused by ex-
posure ~to homosexuality or

t . homosexuals.

It is said that homosexuals are
promiscuous. This may be true in
some cases. however. there- are

' many lesbians and male homosex-

uals involved in monogamous

relationships. There also seems to ‘

be a double standard in our socie-

llnport 80 percent of its
agricultural products from the:
U.S. This Is partially because
l3 percent of Puerto Rico’s
arable land is being occupied
by U.S. military installations
for which. they pay nothing.
Visquez island, the most fertile
land in Puerto Rico. has two-
thirds of Its land occupied by '
the U.S. military the literature
reported. ,‘
In addition. the newsletter
said. m‘anylof todays‘ birth con-
trol pills were tested on Puerto
Rican women of whom one out
of three are now sterile.
Gomez called Puerto Rico a
"full-fledged colony...They
use the U.S. dollar. the U.S.
Mail. the‘U.S. court system.
Their laws must be within the
scope of the U.S.." he said.
Gomez contends that only
independence will give Puerto
Rico the political power to
begin solving their problems.
Such powers include the rigllt
to fix tariffs to protect Puerto
Rican products and the power
to sign trade agreements with
other countries. Puerto Rico's
pcr capitu incomé‘ls currently
half of the U.S.' poorest state.
Mississippi. and their cost of
living is 20 percent higher than
New York City's. according to
the newsletter. .
On November 6. Puerto
Rico elected the leader of the
pro-commonwealth Popular

  

ty with respect to promiscuity.
Behavior which is acceptable for
male heterosexuals is seen as
unacceptable and down right lewd
when heterosexual women and
homosexuals are involved.

Another 'myth of homosexuaii- ,

ty is that in homosexual relations
only the physical is involved. This
is no more‘tr‘ue than it is for
heterosexual relations. The degree
to which the emotions are involv-
ed in a relationship varies from
person to person whether
heterosexual or homosexual. Les-

bians and gay men feel the‘joys-

and pains of love just as any other
human being feels them. These
feelings are no less valid simply
because they are felt for a person
of the same sex rather than for a
person of the opposite sex. Love
does not discriminate.

Are gays child molesters? Bas-
ed on statistics approximately
ninety-seven percent of all child
molestation is done by_ heterosex-
ually oriented persons.

Are gays persons who are sick.
demented. weak. untrustworthy.
and representatives of the lowest
form of life which exists? These
are all judgements based on un-
substantiated opinion. And opi-
nions are NOT facts.

The key is this. The myths
about homosexuality3are based in
irrational and illogical heresay
and conjecture. The only way to
learn the truth about homosch
uality is to rccognize'and cut
through the fear of homosexuali-
ty. The only way to do this is
learn facts. Homosexuals are in-
dividuals who eat. breathe. work,
play. feel pain and feel pleasure.
just like anybody else. There is
nothing to fear. III-
