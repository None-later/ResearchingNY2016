To‘the depressed, life’s d

By Kathleen Brencock

“I felt as though i had to
escape. I was having problems in
school and l was worried about it
and I just felt really bad. I started
having trouble relating to people. i
I wasn’t getting any sleep - I
averaged about an hour a night. I

felt like my* .
Middle

logic was all

fizzled and I

started to lose a 

lot of my self

confidence. I 

became irritable and shouted at

my friends a lot. I knew i was

ruining everyone clse's good times

because I was so depressed and

nasty to everyone around me."
“I started to drink and smoke

.s. ....‘..-. - . . W

pot a lot just to escape reality. My
friends knew something was
wrong but they couldn’t help
because they didn't know how to
help and they couldn't be objec-
tive because they were personally
involved. I felt like I didn't know
where to turn anymore."

“I didn't want people to know
i couldn-‘t' handle my own pro-
blems. so it was hard for me to
seek professional help. it was
hard for me to just dial the phone
and seek that help, but l’m glad i
did. it made me feel better that a
professional didn’t think i was in<
sane. because I wasn't sure
anymore. .I learned to better
understand myself."

“i realize now that everyone

gets depressed sometimes. You
can't be happy all the time. I used
to dwell on my depression and
that just made me more depress-
ed. Now. when l feel down, i help
myself slide out of it by forcing
myself to keep active and by forc-
ing myself to socialize with
friends."

"I think people at this school
would be surprised that a lot of
people they know have felt very
depressed and have sought help.

People shouldn’t feel cmbarassed,

about that."

sonal account of depression and

sion is a common mood distur-

different times and in different
ways. The most common type of
depression is usually brief and
doesn't seriously interfere with
normal activities. Most people
feel down or sad now and then as
a natural reaction to stress and
tension. A change of pace or talk-
ing with a friend are usually
enough to brighten a temporary
down mood.

Many people have more serious
periods of depression. They may
find the responsibilities of daily
living harder to cope with and
may not be able to stop their
unhappy feelings. Symptoms are
similar to those of mild depres-
sion. but are more intense and of
longer duration. A conversation
with a counselor may be helpful
in this case.

Some people become severely
depressed and find they can no
longer cope with daily respon-
sibilities. Loss of interest in the
outside world and seriously pro-

longed behavior changes are
characteristic of this degree of
depression. What delineates nor-
mal depression from more severe
depression is the extent to which
negative feelings are dwelled upon
and the extent of the level of
ielplcssness.

An individual may experience
changes in behavior and attitudes
as a result of depression. Some
examples are irritability,’ emo-
tional flatness or emptiness, an
inability to find pleasure in
anything. feelings of
hopelessness, a neglect of rcspon-
sibilities and appearance. a
general slowing down. poor
memory, loss of sexual desire. ex-
aggerated scif blame and loss of
self esteem. which sometimes lead
to suicidal thoughts or actions.

in addition. a person suffering
from depression may experience
physical symptoms such as a
change in appetite. a change in
