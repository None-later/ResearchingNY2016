Warry over lack of nuclear waste dumps rises

(COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE) A number of
colleges in recent weeks have said
they’re worried governmental footdrag-
ging could leave them holding a radioac-
tive bag by the end of the year.

Rising costs and the lack of a place in
which to dump the low-level radioactive
wast they generate in campus research

want to get rid of it as quickly as
possible.”

But no one has actually established
new dumps sites for the schools.

State legislators have yet to find new
radioactive waste sites for the univer-
sities of Arizona and West Virginia,
despite intense lobbying from educators

Other waste—handing companies can
process the waste for transport. Turner
commented, but, for the time being,
they can bury it only at one of the three
existing dumps.

"It's big business}! declared William
Properzio, the University of Florida’s
director of environmental health and
science. “Any research institute has to
deal with this. When a researcher
designs an experiment. the cost of
disposal has to be written into the
proposal."

Some schools get around the current
regulations by storing certain kinds of

While the NRC regulates most cam—
pus nuclear research, it leaves disposing
of the resultant waste —- and the pay-
ment for it — up to the schools. Gagner
explained.

The NRC also grants licenses to cam-
puses, added Donald Turner, West
Virginia University’s radiation health
technician. .

“The licenses specify disposition of
radioactive waste, and we're sent a list
of compaines that handle the waste." he
said.

radioactive waste themselves.

“Wtih a half-life of 65 days or less,
we decay it here." Turner said. “After
we wait l0 half-lives, the radiation is
one-one thousandth of what we started
with, and we can just put it in the trash
without violating EPA (Environmental
Protection Agency) standards."

Nevertheless. it still costs West
Virginia $20,000 to transport and
dispose of the 68 SS-gallon barrels of
radioactive waste it sends to the South
Carolina dump. Turner noted.

Yale's Bockelman said.

“The federal government is trying to
set up the regional pacts. but the politi-
cians worry about it," he noted.
“Radioactivity is a frightening concept
to people.”

There’s a lot with which to scare peo-
ple. Yale produces 500 30-gallon drums
of liquid radioactive waste and 750
drums ofdry waste per year, Bockelman
said, largely through the medical school
and the biological science department.

“Disposal has been a problem since

But if the states and Congress don't
start moving more quickly toward
creating new dump sites, colleges con-
ducting nuclear research will have no
place to dispose of radioactive waste.

“Universities don't have large areas
