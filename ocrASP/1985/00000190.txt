The Albany State women's
basketball team’s 23-4 record
speaks for itself.

it was the kind of season a
player wants to be part of once in
a career. And it looks like there
will be more seasons of equal
comparison in the future.

The season began with an ex-
citing start. An easy victory over
local rival RPl was followed by a
two point edge over .Oneonta in a
classic game. The first loss of the

season, washanded to. the Danes -

by Cortland, 56-42. This was
followed by an 11 game winning

Streaky-during which the Danes-  ’-
beat the likes of Binghamton and .-
Hartwick, halted by St. Micltaels. i ‘

After” that the. Danes wenthoa
another roll straight to the
SUNYAC East championship.

"I didn‘t expect us to beat the
teams we did.‘-‘

by a few last year l Was scared of
bttt then we blew themaway.”

Tlte big victories of the season
were against Onconta twice. Cor-
tland for the championship,
Hamilton, and Hartwick.

"When we beat Hartwick,
(ranked third in the state at the
time) right then i knew we had a
really strong team," said Jill
Silverman. “We were 8-1 and i
thought ‘This is a damn good
record' we’re going somewhere.
Towards the end i thought we
were going to the NCAAs."

The biggest asset of the team
was its bench depth. This also was
a big factor considering Nancy
Grasso. Lori Bayba and Cindy

said ~Rain’ny f
Lesane. “All the teams we lost to"

 

 

 

at some time in the Season.
“We never get. tired [because
- she plays‘everybody,"' saidDinnc
Fernandes. “We were in a condi-

tioning class with the guys which .

put us in great shape when the
season started."

Another factor of bench depth
was pointed out by Lesane.
“Bench depth has helped a lot.
They couldn't concentrate to the
five starters because we could go

to ten." -

Silverman added, “There was
at least one backup in every posi-
tion and everyone was really eager

— to play. We wore down the op-
ponents with fresh players. It was
a continual process. in that

‘ machine."

For the‘season, .Lesane led-with
17 point per game shooting. 56 1

percent from the ﬁeld,. which
ranked her eighth in the nation at
one point. Her total Of 459 points
was complimented by her 118
assists and 113 steals for the
season. Perhaps one of the best
indications of her caliber was
when she hit 1000 career-point
mark in the Buffalo State game.

Even though Lesane stands
out, the rest of the team’s results
show more well-roundedness.
Lori Bayba averaged 9.3 points
per game with a 196 total. Her
high game was-21 points against
RPl in the capital district tourna-

points per game for a total of 214. _.

.H'er othercontribtrtions were six---
rebounds per game and 57 steals ‘»

for the season.,'Ronnie Patterson
totalled 191 points‘by averaging
7.]. Her high game was 16 points
against Buffalo State. Donna
Hughes led in free throw shooting
with 68 percent accuracy on 21
for 31 shooting.

Bayba, a transfer ’ from St.
John Fischer feels the team is one
big family. “This is the best team
and the best people l’ve played
with. The whole team as a unit are
great individuals not just athletes.
but people as a whole."

Senior Chris Canatta predicts a
succesful season for the Danes

next year! "Coach Warner did a

really good job on recruiting for. ‘

this season. The newcomers are
playing well. I think the success
we’ve had this year will continue

_ in the next couple years." w

The team. still feels cheated

about the NCAAs._ “We were

deﬁnitely ripped," said' .Fera'
nandes. “if we made the NCAAs'

‘ it Would have been a different'

season. A different psyche.“ .

*Mercurio repeats as All-American at NCAAs '

First Albany trackman to repeat honor,

By Ian Clements
STAFF WRITER

Marc Mercurio became the ﬁrst Albany
State athlete to repeat as a track and field

‘ All-American Friday as he placed fifth in

the 3S-pound weight throw in the NCAA
Division ill Indoor Championships.
Despite the accolade it was a somewhat
disappointing performance for the senior-
from Burnt Hills. According to Coach Bob
Munsey. Mercurio had been ranked

.‘among the nation's top three weight-

throwers going into the inaugural meet
held at Bates'College itr Lewiston, Maine.
iiis throw on Friday." 53'7 3/4", was his
third best em but it was oVer a half foot

shorter than his school record, 54’3".

Mercurio can take solace in the
knowledge that he would have needed to
throw a foot further than his record in
order to move up one place. The fourth
place ﬁnisher heaved the ball-and-handle
55'2 3/4". The winner. Parris of
Massachusetts institute of Technology,
three 60'7 1/4". Mercurios’s local rival.
Scott Remillard of Union. placed second
with a 59’3/4" toss.

“He had good speed but he didn't get
much height on his throws," Munsey said.
“we'll be working on it this. week."

“Naturally he was disappointed." said
Munsey. but "to get an All-American in

the first indoor meet (nationals) is rather
nice."

Mercurio first became an All-American
last May when placed fourth in the
hammer throw in the outdoor nationals.
The only other Munsey-coached athlete to
achieve 'All-American status twice was
James Shrader. who gained that honor in
the 6-mile run and in cross-country during
the early 1970’s. Mercurio will have an op-

 

portunity to become the Danes' ﬁrst three-
time track and ﬁeld All-American this
May at the outdoor nationals.

He will have a chance to avenge two
consecutive ﬁnishes behind Remillard this
weekend at the state championships.

“if we ﬁnished in the first seven. l'd be
happy." said .Munsey of his expectations
for the team. “We're mainly lacking in the
400 and 500 area. We don't have enough
people.”

Mercurio was not in Albany and was

unavailable for comment. El

. Division III champ Andy Seras will head to Oklahoma
'City for this weekend’s NCAADivision I tournament. See
I Seras profile on Friday.

finest season. averaging , t.l".4,
points per game and hauling
down 200 rebounds to lead the
team in that department.

Gosule helped the Danes with
his fine outside shooting and most
noticeably, his excellent defensive
skills. Zadoorian‘s fourth season
on varsity was marred by a hand
injury which led to limited play-

But it wasn’t only seniors who
contributed to the Dane’s ﬁne
season. Sophomore Adam
Ursprung had a tremendous year
despite missing several games ear-
ly in the season with a leg injury.
Upsprung returned to the line-up
and went on to lead Albany in
points-per-game (14.2) and
rchottncls-pcr-game.

Ursprung was also natned‘to‘
the All-Tournament team at the
SUNYAC Championships and
joined Croutier on the All-
SUNYAC squad.

Opposing coaches often
pointed to the‘Danes' depth as a
key factor in their sudccss. Rich
Chapman and John Mracek pro-
vided additional support up front
for Albany. while John Carntello
anti Doug Kilmer helped out in
the back court.

Brian Kauppila's versatility was
an important asset to the team as
he was equally at home in either
the guard or forward position.

But a talented team is nothing
without talented coaching and
Sauers and his assistant Barry
Cavanaugh provided that. In
fact. the SUNYAC recognized
Sauers contributions this year.
naming him eo-coach of the year
along with Buffalo State‘s Dick
Bihr.

Perhaps the final factor in the
success this year was the return of
fans to University Gym.
Several of the players noted the
itnportance of a big crowd and

welcome change from previous
years with sparse crowds and little

Lowbau. Here’s to good friends.

The moon was up, the stars
were out and—pffttl—your rear
tire was down. Good thing there
was a phone nearby. And a few
good friends who were willing
to drive a dozen miles, on a
Saturday night, to give you a
lift. When you grit back, you
want to do more than just say
“thanks? So tonight, let it be
