Vivian Gordon. former chair of
tth African Afro-American
Sttrdies Department. rc'signed
from her chairship last Week on

the request of John Webb, Dean’

of the School of Social Sciences.
‘ ‘l requested her to step aside as
chair because l'thought'therc‘ were
difficulties — problems with
faculty members." said Webb.
He declined further comment on
the issue, stating that “these mat-
ters are being considered on the
universitylevcl."

According to Sheila Mahan, of -

the University's News Bureau. “it
was found that it (the Department
of African and Afro-American
Studies) would bcnfit by _new
leadership. She resigned by the
Dean’s request and then re-
quested a leave of absence."
Gordon. who is an associate
professor in thadcpartment. was

“Wé’re working on the matter
of what's going on with her
classes. Guest lecturers are doing

-them now." said Julius Thomp-

to “what happened to Vivian

‘ Gordon and what would happen

to her students.” said senior

Michael Zaretsky. .
Zaretsky and other students

enrolled in Gordon's classes went

I to Webb's office Thursday to de-
; mind that someone teach their

classes. Zaretsky said.
“When we got there we were

: met by two members of ASUBA

(Albany State University Black

I Alliance), who said that she had
‘ been reinstated," said Zarctsky.

adding that thc ASUBA mcmbcrs
told them that Gordon said she
would prefer small groups of
students expressing their support.

' ~' rather than a large group.

But later that day. said Zaret-
s_ky. a faculty member. who did
not wish to be identified. told him
that this was misinformation and
she was not in fact reinstated.

Zaretsky also 'said that chb
stressed the fact that although
Gordon was removed as head of
the department it was her choice
to leave as a teacher.

“She is a great professor. a
powerful lecturer," said one of

blems with faculty in her depart-
ment. and- the dean. "‘Two
members of the faculty had less
than cordial relationships with
her. She also had problems with
the dean." said Joseph Sarfoh, a
professor in the department. ad-
ding that thcrc was not tension
within the entire faculty.

Gordon came to SUNYA from
the University of Virginia. where
she chaired the Black Studies pro-
gram for five years. “At the time
i became director. the program
was in complete disrepair; there
were only four majors with the
lowest GPAs. At the end of this
five year period," explained Gor-
don. "there were 19 majors in-
cluding two Echols Scholars; all
the majors had very high (PAS
and the program was competitive
with all ‘ other social science
programs."

Gordon resigned from that
position to pursue a full time
position as a professor of
sociology at UVa and to do
research as part of a National ln-
stitutc of Mental Health Research
Grant. “Two years after i left the

Charges of usurped power and sexual
harassment against University Cinemas
treasurer Rich Kunen caused Central
Council Wednesday night to refer the mat-
ter of whether or not he will remain in his
position to Student Association: Supreme,
Court. .

Cinemas Director Lisa Fccrick, who
made the allegations. said she was also in
the process of filing a harassment com-
plaint with the University.

“This has been going on for about six
weeks. He is a competent treasurer but in-
tcrfcrcs in other mcmbcrt' areas to the
point that they cannot carry out their
duties. He has booked and cancelled films
on his own which is against the Constituy
tion of ,our group." she said. adding
“there have also been incidents of abuse.
harassment and the use of profane
language against myself and other
members of the ‘group.“_

Kuuen however. said. “everything that l
have done has been for the group. i tun do-
ing tt good job as treasurer." '

Kuncn said Thursday. “1 violated the
Constitution only for-the good of the
group because films were not being pickcd
up and we might have lost money. it was u
technical violation." .

Fccrick said, “i have discussed writing
up u grlcvnncc with Gloria DcSolc. Direc-
tor of Affirmative Action. i will write and
discuss it with her before 1 sign the com-
plaint tomorrowor next week."

"Kunt-n has consistently used ccrtuln
derogatory scxutti langauagc to me and in
front of others. i have tried to keep the
personal tutti business matters scpurutc."
she said. "

Salkin. who said. "i was made aware of
the problems with University. Cinemas
about six weeks ago when Lisa calledmc at
home. i talked with RichiKun'en and told
him about the problems. He denied them
and made countercharges about Lisa."

Kuncn said that he could not comment
on the allegations because “i am not aware
that this was going to the Supreme Court
or that there was an affirmative action
complaint."

He added. “she thinks l treat her badly
because she is a female. i am not sexist. i
personally like her and do not want her to

\ resign." '
According to Kuncn. “she (Fccrick) is '

on a vendetta to get me out ofthc office...l
never wanted it to go this far.“

SA President Rich Schaffcr said that he
felt he could not remove Kuncn on his own
authority. and so presented the matter to
Council. He added, however. “i may sign
an cxccntivc order and suspend him on my
own if the matter is not acted upon."

,Schaffcr has called a meeting for 5 pm.
Friday to discuss the matter. .

Rob Fishkin attended the meeting and
spoke in Kuncn's defense. He said that he
is not a council member and that “I
originally went to speak in support of Off
Campus Association's budget request.
thtt i found out about the University
Cinemas issue i spoke up as ttn observer to

'sotncthing which i felt was nnfttir to the
