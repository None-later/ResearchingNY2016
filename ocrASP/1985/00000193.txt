Iraqi bank blasted L

Tehran ~
(AP) Iran said it hit the Iraqi capital of
Baghdad with. a missile early Thursday,
and witnesses in downtown Baghdad said
an explosion demolished most of the
l2-story main branch of the government-
owncd Rafidan Bank.

After Iran's attack. the official lslatnic
Republic News Agency of iran said Iraqi
warplanes fired missiles into Iran’s capital
Tehran and the northeastern city of
Tabriz. killing I7 people.

An Iraqi spokesman confirmed the air
raids on the two cities. and said a ship
headed for Iranian ports had been attack-

Iraq. at war with Iran since September
I980. did not comment on Iran's claim
that it attacked Baghdad. The two nations
have been engaged in more than a week of
daily attacks on civilian targets.

Toxic controls costly

Washington. DC
(AP) Controlling toxic chemicals in the
Great Lakes has proved more difficult
than curtailing the phosphorus that used to
be the main pollutant. a report by the In-

 

 

..tu ,

ternational Joint Commission concluded
Wednesday.

Cities on both sides of the' U.S.-Canada
border have sperit $7.6 million on
wasiewatcr treatment plants since 1972.
the report byvthe advisory agent said. and
the use of phosphorus in “household .
detergents and i‘crtllizers‘has been sharply,
cut back._ I '

“These phosphorus. control programs
have improved water quality," the l7-page
report said. “Nutrient goals for Lake

« Superior have-been met; Lake Erie. and

Ontario continue to show declines in
phosphorus concentrations. Saginaw Bay
on Lake Huron. which experienced ac-
celerated autrophication in the late 19605
and early 19705. is also improving."
Federal and local governments have had
less success in dealing with toxic pollution.
however, in part because awareness of the
problem is more recent and contamination
can come from a wide variety of chemicals
that are hard to detect. ‘

Relations seem to be strained at
best between radio station WCDB
and Puttin’ on the Ritz. a local
night club featuring live rock
music.

WCDB co-sponsored two live
shows at the “Ritz” recently, the
Del Fuegos and the
Replacements. and. according to
Joe Romano. General Manager at
WCDB. Ritz manager Kevin
Murray’s dealings with the station
were “very unprofessional."

In a recent letter to the ASP.
Romano made It clear that the
station has no regular working
relationship with the Ritz, stress-
ing that they were dissatisfied
with the way the club handled the
promotion of the two shows. One
of Romano's major complaints
concerned the distribution of free
tickets to WCDB, with Murray's
permission, to the Del Fuegos
show.

According to Romano. “Mur-
ray agreed to let us give away ten
pairs of tickets to the show. When
the ticket-holders got to the door.
Murray claimed to have only
allowed for ten single tickets. He
refused to let the others in
without charging them." He add—
ed. “Tickets are always given in
1 pairs. How many shows do you

know of that give away single
tickets?"

When asked about the mix-up.

 

 

The event was coordinated by Off Campus
Association member Rob Fishkin and the Off
Campus Housing Ofﬁce to help students make
the transition. from dorm life to living off.

population who could stand to know more about
living in a city of their own." said Fishkin, who
added that the_eve'nt attempted to bring together
the people who needed to know more with those
-who could inform them.

OCHO Director Karleen ‘Karlson said that

they have been faced with the 'problems of the
adult."

One topic of discussion for the day was
Albany's grouper law, which says that no more
than three unrelated people can live together in

 

ment. Michael Alvaro. was on hand to answer

“There is a significantlsegment of thesiudénb

Sophomore Steven Barkin, who said he was
planning to move off campus, said the day was
,“helpful and interesting." ' ’ - ’

"There’s aim of important things that many

people don’t know and many services they don‘t
use because. they don't know they're available."

‘ agreed junior Mary Pasclewicz. who lives off.

Fishkin said he was pleased with the turnout.
“People walking through the Campus Center
were interested and stopped to find out more
about living off campus." he said

Fishkin attributed the day's success to the fact

‘that “the whole group worked together.“

“Rob Fishkin led a great job in bringing
together these different groups that have impact
on o campus students." said Karlson. ‘

Murray claimed that it was simply
a mistake. “This was my ﬁrst

' station." he said. “I didn't realize
_ that when the people at WCDB
pairs. It was simply a
misunderstanding.”
Murray also claimed that those
people who were charged at the
Del Fuegos show were later reim-
bursed at the Replacements show.
“I not only gave those people
their free tickets. but I gave them
each a pair of tickets. I reimburs-
ed them twice over.” he said.
According to Romano.
however. this was not the case.
“Murray promised to replace the

‘ said ten tickets. they meant _ten‘

tickets, but it never happened.”
he said. "When those people got
to the door. they were forced to
pay again."

Another of Romano’s conten-
tions was that adequate space was
not supplied to accommodate the
customers for the Del Fuegos
show. “Murray promised to clear
the tables from the floor to make
room for more people." he said.
“This was not done either. Many
of the station people who had
tickets couldn’t get in."

The Ritz was forced to turn
away about a hundred people for
lack of space the night of the
show. According to Murray. he
never made suehla promise. “The
removal of the tables was a sug-
gestion which we took into con-
sideration.” he said. "There are
about 20 tables in the place. We
did move some out. but obviously
we had to leave some in so our
customers could sit if they wanted

WCDB was also angered at the
fact that they received no credit
for their part in promoting the
two shows which were so suc-
cessful. According to Romano.
the station received no credit and
“not even a thank you" for their
part in the shows' success.

Murray’s response to this was
that he was not responsible for
the credit given. “There was an
article in the Times-Union review-
ing the shows which did not men-
tion WCDB." he said. "That was
not my fault. they just weren't
given the publicity."

Michael Eck. a disc jockey for
WCDB. had his own complaints
about the Ritz’s booking tactics.
Eck is a member of a band called
The Chefs of the Future. which
he says was booked to play at the
Ritz on February 21. “As far as
we know we were booked to play
for that night.” he said. “It
wasn't until we saw posters adver-
tising another band that we realiz-
ed something was wrong. He
(Murray) knew at least a week in
advance that our show was

Begin preaches ‘miracle’ of israeli democracy

By Bette Dzamba
smrr warren

The Zionist revolution was “carried on
the sltottlders of young people. inspired by
men (and) inspired by divinity.” said Ben-
jamin Begin in the PAC Recital Hall.

Begin. the son of former Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin. spoke to about
60 people Monday night. as part of a
goodwill tour of the United States.

His talk was puncuated by the phrase
I‘but don’t take it for granted.” He can-
tioned. “sometimes we are overwhelmed
by headlines and news...so overwhelmed
by that that we become less aware of where
we are now. where we came from, and
what is the significance of all that Is."

Begin pointed ottt that in i7 A.D.. when
the second Jewish temple was burned
down. it was “the beginning of a tortuous
and dark road." He asked. “lfyou were at
the burning temple and asked
what you thought the chances were that a
Jewish nation would exist at the same
place again in nearly 2.000 years?...You'd
say ‘uo cltunce'." he asserted.

Tile establishment of Israel can't be
taken for granted,” he maintained. noting
that “in retrospect, we have llte tendency
to judge events by the fact that they occur-
red. but don't take titeurt‘qrgruptcd.“

Begin held up till »_ .sragll; Hebrew

miracle. "At a price of 20 cents that's ten

The first miracle Begin cited was that
there In news In Hebrew. He noted that the
transformation ofun ancient language to a
“vivid. everyday language" has not hap-
pened often.

Begin explained that. the .“tnirucle‘l

The second "miracle" that Begin allud-

stated. but once again warneti.:"bttt:don‘t ;

take it for granted."

Citing justice as "an important social
tool (and) a term we take for granted,“ he
noted that “we acquire a sense ofjustice at
an early stage of Iife...children at the ages
of 2 and 3 say ‘this is not l‘air‘.“

Begin cotnpared justice to eyesight. and
said that although eyesight develops very
early it is easily deceived by optical illu-
sions. “Our sense of justice. too. is easily
deceived." he cautioned.

“Preaching Zionism had to do with a
change in the course of history." he
asserted. adding. "it meant saying it
should be done; it can be done: we can do
it; I can do it." Begin said that making
those four statements is not easy. and that
each is progresivcly harder to say; especial—
ly. “I can do it."

Begin gave his views on the significance
of the [ionisi revolution. Ilc referred to it
as “a call for action and it basis for hope."

ting out that lit 1983 Israel lilltl the largest
