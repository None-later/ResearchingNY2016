German link opposed

I Moscow
(AP) The new Soviet leader. Mikhail Gor-
bachev. told West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl Thursday he opposed
Western European participation in Presi-
dent Reagan’s space-based defense
research plan. But, Kohl said, there was no
warning, as in the past. about jeopardizing
nuclear arms agreements.

“Gorbachev indicated that he doesn‘t.
want Western Europe to go along with or
participate in" the Strategic Defense In-
itiative. Kohl told reporters after the
meeting. But the West German leader
declined to elaborate.

The so-called “Star Wars" plan was the
major subject of conversation Wednesday
between Gorbachev and Margaret That-
cher. the British prime minister had told
reporters.

Gorbachev continued to receive world
leaders Thursday after meeting for 85
minutes Wednesday with Vice President
George Bush. who said afterward. “If
there was ever a time when we could move
forward with progress in the last few years.
l’d say that this is a good time for that."

 

Iraqi bank blasted ‘

' Tehran
(AP) iran said it hit the lraqi capital of
Baghdad with. a missile early Thursday.
and witnesses in downtown Baghdad said
an explosion demolished most of the
IZ-story main branch of the government-
owned Rafidan Bank.

After iran’s attack. the official lslamic
Republic News Agency of lran said lraqi
warplanes fired missiles into lran’s capital
Tehran and the northeastern city 'ol'
Tabriz. killing 17 people. '

An Iraqi spokesman confirmed the air
raids on the two cities. and said a ship
headed for iranian ports had been attack-
ed in the Persian Gulf.

Iraq. at war with iran since September
1980. did not comment on lran‘s claim
that it attacked Baghdad. The two nations
have been engaged in more than a week of
daily attacks on civilian targets.

Personnel evacuated

Washington, DC
(AP) The White House said Thursday
some U.S. embassy personnel have been
evacuated from Beirut temporarily

 

because of “unsettléd conditions."

Presidential spokesman Larry Speakes
refused to say how many people had been
evacuated but did say that the U.S. am-
bassador, Reginald Bartholomew, remains
at his post. ’

“We continue to be concerned about the
safety of our official personnel in
Lebanon." .Speakes said. “We are taking
action when we deem it necessary." he
added. '

Toxic controls costly

Washington, DC '
(AP) Controlling toxic chemicals in the
Great Lakes has proved more difficult
than curtailing the phosphorus that used to
be the main pollutant, a report by the in-

 

 

 

ternational Joint Commission concluded
Wednesday.

Cities on both sides of the‘U.S.-Canada_
border have sperit $7.6 million on
wa'ste'water treatment plants since 1972.
the report byyt‘he advisory agent said. and
the use of phosphorus in.“household ~
detergents and fertilizershas been sharply
cut back. - ‘

“These phasphorus. control programs
have improved water quality," the l7-page
report said. “Nutrient goals for Lake

- superior ha‘ve‘been met: Lake..Erie,‘and

Ontario continue to show declines in
phosphorus concentrations. Saginaw Bay
on Lake Huron. which experienced ac:
celerated autrophication in- the late _l960§
and early l9705, is also improving."
Federal and local governments have had
less success in dealing with toxic pollution.
however, in part because awareness of the
problem is more recent and contamination
can come from a wide variety of chemicals
that are hard to detect. ‘

Relations seem to be strained at
best between radio station WCDB
and Puttin' on the Ritz, a local
night club featuring live rock
music.

WCDB co-sponsored two live
shows at the "Ritz" recently, the
Del Fuegos and the
Replacements. and, according to
Joe Romano. General Manager at
WCDB. Ritz manager Kevin
Murray's dealings with the station
were “very unprofessional.”

In a recent letter to the ASP,
Romano made it clear that the
station has no regular working
relationship with the Ritz. stress-
ing that they were dissatisﬁed
with the way the club handled the
promotion of the two shows. One
of Romano's major complaints
concerned the distribution of free
tickets to WCDB. with Murray's
permission. to the Del Fuegos
show.

According to Romano, “Mur-
ray agreed to let us give away ten
pairs of tickets to the show. When
the ticket-holders got to the door.
Murray claimed to have only
allowed for ten single tickets. He
refused to let the others in
without charging them." He add-
ed. “Tickets are always given in
pairs. How many shows do you
know of that give away single
tickets?"

When asked about the mix-up.
' Murray claimed that it was simply
a mistake. “This was my first
time dealing with a college radio
station." he said. "I didn't realize
.that when the. people .at WCDB

 

pairs. it was simply a
misunderstanding."
Murray also claimed that those
people who were charged at the
Del Fuegos show were later reim-
bursed at the Replacements show.
“I not only gave those people
their free tickets. but I gave them
each a pair of tickets. I reimburs-
ed them twice over." he said.
According to Romano.
however. this was not the case.
“Murray promised to replace the

" said ten tickets. they meant "ten'

tickets. but it never happened,"
he said. “When those people got
to the door, they were forced to
pay again."

Another of Romano’s conten—
tions was that adequate space was
not supplied to accommodate the
customers for the Del Fuegos
show. “Murray promised to clear
the tables from the floor to make
room for more people." he said.
“This was not done either. Many
of the station people who had
tickets couldn’t get in.”

The Ritz was forced to turn

away about a hundred people for
lack of space the night of the
show. According to Murray, he
never made such a promise. "The
removal of the tables was a sug-
gestion which we took into con-
sideration." he said. “There are
about 20 tables in the place. We
did move some out. but obviously
we had to leave some in so our
customers could sit if they wanted
to.”
WCDB was also angered at the
fact that they received no credit
for their part in promoting the
two shows which were so suc-
cessful. According to Romano.
the station received no credit and
“not even a thank you" for their
part in the shows' success.

Murray’s response to this was
that he was not responsible for
the credit given. “There was an
article in the Times-Union review-
ing the shows which did not men-
tion WCDB." he said. “That was
not my fault, they just weren't
given the publicity." '

Michael Eek. a'disc‘ jockey for
WCDB. had his own complaints
about the Ritz’s booking tactics.
Eek is a member of a band called
The Chefs of the Future, which
he says was booked to play at the
Ritz on February 21. “As far as
we know we were booked to play
for that night.” he said. “it
wasn't until we saw posters adver-
tising another band that we realiz-
ed something was wrong. He
(Murray) knew at least a week in
advance that our show was

The Zionist revolution was “carried on
the shoulders of young people. inspired by
men (and) inspired by divinity." said Ben-
jamin Begin in the PAC Recital Hall.

Begin. the son of former lsraeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin. spoke to about
60 people Monday night. as part of a
goodwill tour of the United States. .

His talk was puncuated by the phrase
“but don’t take it for granted.” He cau-
tioned, “sometimes we are overwhelmed
by headlines and news...so overwhelmed
by that that we become less aware of where
we are now, where we came from. and
what is the significance of alithat is."

Begin pointed out that in 17 A.D.‘. when
the second Jewish temple was burned
down. it was "the beginning of a tortuous
and dark road." He asked, "Ifyou were at
the burning temple and someone asked
what you thought the chances were that a
Jewish nation would exist at the same
place again in nearly 2,000 years?...You‘d
say ‘no chance'.” he asserted.

The establishment of lsrael can’t be
taken for granted," he maintained. noting
that “in retrospect. we have the tendency
to judge events by the fact that they occur-
red. but don't take tirerrt,liqr;grarttcti."

Begin held up an ; Esrpgll : ,iicbrew

miracle. “At a price of 20 cents that's ten
cents a miracle," he qulpped.
The first miracle Begin cited was‘that

there is news in Hebrew. He noted that the _

transformation of an ancient language to a
“vivid. everyday language" has not hap-
pened often. I ‘

Begin explained that. the ,“miruclc”

came about as the result of “a decision ‘

made by a group of people that ill order to
weld Jews from all over the world a com-

mon language was needed...chrew was
tile natural choice.”

The second “miracle” that Begin allud-
ed to was that Israel has a free press at all.

tool (and) a term we take for granted," he
noted that “we acquire a sense of justice at
an early stage of Iife...children at the ages
of 2 and 3 say ‘this is not fair'."

Begin compared justice to eyesight. and
said that although eyesight develops very
early it is easily deceived by optical illu-
sions. “Our sense ofjusticc. too. is easily
deceived." he cautioned.

"Preaching zionism had to do with a
change in the course of history.” he
asserted. adding. “it meant saying it
should be done; it can be done; we can do
it: I can do it." Begin said that making
those four statements is not easy, and that
each is progresively harder to say; especial-
ly. "I can do it.”

Begin gave his views on the significance
of' the zionist revolution. He referred to it
as “a call for action and a basis for hope."

Hc illustrated Israel's success by poin-
ting ottt that in I983 Israel had the largest
number of publications in international
science journals per capita. The nation
ranked I3th in the gross number of
publications in such journals. lte said.

A member of the audience told llt‘gin
that he had heard him speak on geology
and ecology in Jerusalem a few. years ago.
Begin quickly replied. “I was more com-
fortable with bath the. topic and the. set~
