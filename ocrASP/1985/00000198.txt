With all this practical ex-

“Ah, yes. the future." Young
said. “Perhaps the most difﬁcult

Sinatra also asked AMlA to
"strongly consider" Nadler's sug-
gestion that “all intentional blows
to the head, groin or knees...shall
be assumed to have the intent of
injury."

Nadler said he is “very happy
with the fact that the Court sup-
ported ihe idea that AMlA had
no basis for my suspension. I’m
happy I can go back to playing

else."

Eck’s opinion of the Ritz's
management was not very
positive. “it is not being run cor-
rectly." he said. “it’s being run
as a real money-maker. That’s his
(Murray’s) only concern. He’s got
to start thinking about keeping
his audience happy." Eck
described Murray as "cocky," ex-
plaining “he thinks he‘s got the
only club in Albany and he wants

Lenny Marcus, AMIA
Secretary. said that the decision
“was very fair.” He emphasized
that the adoption of the rule forc-
ing AMIA Council members with
conflicting interests in a' case to
withdraw from voting in that case
is a “gem” of a decision.

“It worked out well for both
sides," added Marcus. - D

Romano had a more positive
view towards future relations with
the Ritz. “We would-have no ob-
jection to doing more shows with
them if they changed their
methods." he said. “When we
dealt with them before. the Ritz
tended to treat WCDB as a bunch
of little kids, not as profes-
sionals." He added that this
would not keep the station from
dealing with the Ritz. "Only our
past experience in doing those two
shows keeps us from dealing with
.he club."

Murray was also receptive to
the idea of a future working rela—
tionship with WCDB. “I had no
idea that anything was wrong un-
til I read Joe’s (Romano's) letter
in the ASP," he said. “I was sup-
posed to sit down with the people
from the station and work out our
:liff‘crenccs, but they never got in
