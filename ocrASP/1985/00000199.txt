“There are a number of rumors
that misinform about my work
with Black Studies in Virginia."
Gordon added. “1 have no idea
how this information has been at-
tained. l have an outstanding
record in Black Studies." Gordon
teaches from an alto-centric
ideology which, although “sup-
ported by major scholars,‘ some
people consider it street comer
rhetoric or racist propaganda."
she said.

“The whole incident started in
February when Dean Webb
brought the matter to the atten-
tion of Vice-President Judith
Ramaley," said Mahan.

Gordon ﬁlled the vacancy left
two years ago when Frank Pogue
was promoted from chair of the
department to Vice-President of
Student Affairs. Professor Seth
Speliman served as acting chair
last year. Mahan noted that a new
chair will be appointed soon. E]

discriminating laws do not exist
anymore. Discrimination has
become more subtle." The
subtleties involve people's beliefs.
and those will be much harder to
change, she said.

A national ERA is still a goal
that Azner ls striving for. “(A na-
tional) ERA would give some
measure of uniformity. as oppos-
ed to the current patchwork
which exists across the country
now." she said. When asked how
she would react if her goals would
one day be met, she replied, “I
wouldn't mind having cut myself
out ofajob."
