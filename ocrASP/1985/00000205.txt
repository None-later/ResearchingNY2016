“Show Your Pride '85," the Class of
,1985's pledge program, kicked off its cam-
"paign Thursday night at'the Ralhskellar in
.the first of a~scrios of events aimed at
reachingtheir goal of $20,000 by the end
ofthe semester. ‘1 V

Seniors involved in- the pledge drive
celebrated the program’s start and listened

to pep talks from .Vico President of 'Stus'...

dent Affairs Dr. Frank ,Pogue and Class of

.‘ ' . ’85 President Jeff Schneider.

The-money raised will be donated to the
University for a “high tech message
board," to be displayed in a “visible place
on campus," said Schneider. The campus
‘center and the lecture centers are two of
the locations being considered as possible
sites for the message board.

“We wanted to give . something the
whole university can utilizc.’f said
Schneider, adding “the thing that makes a
university better is when students care."

This is the first year a SUNYA Class
Council has planned such- a pledge
program.

The pledge drive will be run by 10 co-
chairs. who are in charge of five captains
each. who in turn are in charge of five
agents each. The 200 agents will be respon-
sible for reaching eight seniors apiece to
solicit pledge money, said Schneider.
There are about 2.500 seniors in the class

“Every graduating senior will be reach-
ed this Way," explained Schneider. ‘

Seniors will have onb year after gradua-
tion to pay their pledges and the total
amount collected "will be announced on
Torch Night. a SUNYA tradition in which
graduating seniors pass on the “torch of
knowledge” to lower class members in a
candle lighting ceremony.

“Most of the faces were new (at the
Rat). This will work because we will pr0<
bably reach everybody in the senior class
through their friends," said Patty Salkin,

Student Association Programming Direc-
tor and a member of the Class of '85. “All
the social cliques will be reached." she
promised. .

Many people still don’t know what the
pledge program is about. said Salkin.
Brochures have just recently been mailed
to seniors. she said, adding that “when
people hear pledge money their cars go
off.”

keep up the tradition," said Co-chair Dave
Silk. adding that the party ‘at the
Rathskellar was a “roaring success.”

“if we work together we can make a lot
of money," said Co-captain Tracey
Lindenbaum. “1 met people that 1 had
never seen before," she said. adding that a
lot of people are getting involved in the
program. ,

“The goal of $20,000 is a little high,"

 Weekendfbrum catered to minority needs

 

By David Werthelm
smrr warren

About 30 Puerto Rican high school
students from wa York City got a taste of
SUNYA as part of a Fuerza Latina spon-
sored event Saturday.

Minorities oftcn make up only very
small percentages of the student body, and
so many schools have been initiating
recruitment programs aimed at minority
students in recent years. . _

“it's a good feeling to have you up
here.” said Fucrzu Latina member Lily
Romero, “we hope that we have some in-
ﬂuence on your decision about college."

influence came in many forms at the
“Open House." Morning activities includ-
ed a campus ,tour. and lunch at Dutch
Quad. 1n the afternoon, th‘ree ad-
ministrators and one professor he'd a panel
and open discussion on a widcj'rnngc of
subjects in LC19.

Many of the students said that they will
have problems affording the cest of col-
lege. Lois Tripp. Director of Minority
Recruitment. talked about financial aid
with a focus on the Educationalpppor-
tunillcs Program (EOP). "if you qualify
for EOP." said Tripp, “your freshman
year expenses will be fully funded. The
following three years you will probably
take out small loans, rangihg from $200 up
to $1.500." ‘

“1 applied BOP." said Jasmin Perez. a
senior at New York's High School of

Minority recruitment ls often overlooked.
Music and Art. “but 1 don't like it. From
what I hear, the BOP students here don't
mix with other students. it is almost a
negative lubci if you cannot afford
college."

Mosl of the students said that they either
have or will be applying to Albany State.
Some students asked questions about the
application process. Some also asked
about qualifications for admission. “l'm
very pleased with the active participation
and many questions asked by the
students," said Fuerzu Latina President

 

Carlos Laboy.

“Regular [501’ and minority students
are our focus,” said Fuerza Latina Chair
of Minority Affairs Anthony Torres. ad-
ding “wc are trying to attract Hispanics to
join the University in greaternumbers.”

“At present, only 258 Hispanic
undergraduates and 11 graduates attcpd
SUNY Albany. We are making a statement
in favor of increasing this." said Fuerza
Latina member Veronica Cruz. “We feel
that active recruitment is one way of get-
ting highcr enrollment."

Several organizations played a part in
the open house program. for which, accor-
ding to Torres. planning began in
September. Fuerza Lutina was in contact
with the administrative department of
minority recruitment and thc Albany State
University Black Alliance, said Torres.
"ASUBA lacked Fuerzu Latinu's person-
nel.” said Torres. “and we realized that it
was basically our job to make this a big
weekend. Hopefully we can perpetuate this
lrtlo an annual happening."

A New York City organization culled
Aspirin. which is Spanish for “itspirc.”
helped bring the students to Albany, ac-
cording to Aspiru community organizer
Victor Velez. “We were told by Fucrzn
Lalinu‘ what kind of students they were
looking for. and we contacted guidance
counselors and students." said Velez. “We
were looking for students with a leaning

Student activity
lee cap hiked to
$120 per year by
SUNY Central

By Pam Conway

Student activity fees can now be rais-
cd to as high as $120 per year as the
result of a decision to hike the fce’s cup
by 20 percent by SUNY Central.

However, one SUNYA Student
Association official said there was little
chance the University‘s fee would be
increased.

Harry Charlton, a spokesman for
SUNY Central, said that the decision
was a result of a letter sent by Susan
Wray. president of State University Stu-
dent Association to SUNY Chancellor
Clifton Wharton.

According to Charlton, Wray‘s letter
urged the Chancellor to raise the cap on
the activity fee in order to “allow SUNY
schools more flexibility in thier activities
and programs." ,

Wharton responded by agreeing that
“because of the rise in activity costs
(transportation. equipment, materials,
etc.). the ceiling should be raised by
twenty-percent - from $100 to $120."

only raises the ceiling. Each campus
must ultimately make the decision as to
whether they -will take advantage of the
new cap and raise their own activity
fee."

Charlton also mentioned that every
four years a student referendum must be
held on each campus to determine
whether the activity fee should be man-l
datory or voluntary. A referendum on
the subject is scheduled for this April at
SUNYA. -

“No SUNY school has ever voted for
a voluntary fee because of the obvious
disadvantages. The burden of paying
for activities and programs which
beneﬁt the entire student body would be
left up only to those who chose to pay,"
said Charlton.

Like all other SUNY schools,
Albany’s student activity fee is a man-
datory one. included as part of tuition.

At the present time. the fee stands at
$99.
