S. Korean'students are democratic catalysts

By Charles Coon
STAFF WRITER

While some people contend that student
activism is dying in the United States, col-
lege students in South Korea have been a
leading force in the campaign for
democracy in that country, according to
David Easter, a staff member of the
Albany based Committee for a New Korea
Policy.

Easter cited an example where students’
ﬂexing their collective muscle overturned a
rule imposed on them by the authoritarian
Korean President Chun Doo Hwan.

in the fall of 1984, students at three top
universities in South Korea decided they
wanted an elected student government.
However. the Student Defense Corps. an
ROTC-like outfit, according to Easter.
was the only student organization allowed
to exist, and members were appointed -by
professors.

The students, from Seoul National,
Yonsei and Korea Universities; boycotted
final exams in protest. Soldiers then ac-
tually pushed the students into the
classrooms. Still the students refused to
take the exams, he said, adding the govern-
ment eventually backed down and student
government elections took place shortly
thereafter.

“The remarkable thing is that (the
students) maintained their solidarity over
an entire week,” Easter said.

Easter spoke last Wednesday night in
HU 27. His discussion, “The U.S. Role in
Korea," was the second of four presenta-
tions sponsored by the Democratic
Socialists of America (DSA) on foreign
policy issues.

in South Korea‘s February elections,
student power led the strong gust of the
new opposition party which won sixty-
seven of the 276 total seats in the Korean
National Assembly. he said.

The New Korea Democratic Party was

formed only one month before the
February 12th elections. it was formed by
oppostion politicians who, until recently,
were banned by the Chun government,
Easter explained.

Other oppostion parties and in-
dependents won sixty seats. Chun's ruling
Democratic Justice Party garnered one-
hundred forty-eight seats, three less than
in the 1981 elections.

Chun’s party won just over thirty-five
percent of the popular vote while newly
formed New Korera Democratic Party got
twenty-nine percent. Over eighty-four per-
cent of the eligible voters voted, the
highest turnout since 1960, but according
to Easter, “The way the election is set up,
Chun‘s party will'always have a majority

.' (of the Assembly seats)."

The New York Times reports that op-
position forces said after the election they
would try to form a broad legislative coali-
tion against the Chun government.

The Times also says that the National
Assembly is not so much an effective
legislative body as a forum for grievances.
it does not guide decisions made at the
Blue House, the presidential residence.

in any case, the new National Assembly
will be a noisier place when it convenes in
April.

At about the same time in April that the
Assembly regroups, South Korean Presi-
dent Chun' Will be meeting in Washington
with  President Reagan. Also in April,
Korean college students arrive back in
school after a lengthy recess. This spring,
the campus opposition'plus more vocal
legislative opposition equals a new test of

 

the Chun government's tolerance. to
dissent. , '

The U.S. has supported Chun since he
gained power in early 1980, filling the void
,left by the October, 1979 assassination of
'President’l’ark Chung Hee.'who had serv-
ed in that capacity since l96l. .

Before Park. Syngman Rhee? ruled
‘ Seoul, having been handpicked by the U.S.
l.al'ter World War ii. Chun, Park and Rhee
I have all been autocratic rulers, Easter said,
adding the U.S. supports the South
Korean govaernment for economic and
military advantages.

“First, it is because of our economic in-
terests —— low wages, no strikes allowed
and $10 billion trade per year,” said
Easter, “Second. the U.S. Wants to keep
military bases in South Korea."

"1 do not think these (40,000) troops are
necessary to defend South Korea,” said
Easter. “Both South and North Korea
have huge military forces, and South
Korea has twice the military-age popula-
tion to draw from. South Korea also has a

 

" stronger economy."

The 40.000 U.S. troops are the only
foreign troops in the Koreas. according to
Easter.

According to Easter. the U.S. has “had
no serious talks with any of the opposi-
tion’s representatives.”

Easter’s organization would like to see
the reunification of the two Koreas.

' “After visiting North Korea, I believe a

reunification will be possible. There are
more similarities than differences (between
North and South Koreas),” said Easter.

North Korea “is no longer a puppet of
Russia. They are closer to China
diplomatically," he added.

The DSA is sponsoring two more discus-
sions on U.S. foreign intervention. On
Wednesday, March 20th the topic is Chile
and a week later South Africa will be
discussed. ‘ '4 ‘ ’ ‘ ' i

In the last few weeks, there have been up to five bus breakdowns at a time.

Absent Wellington detains riders

By Pam Schusterman '
STAFF WRITER I

Midterm exams were not the only problem that
SUNYA offcampus students had to face the morn-
ing of Tuesday, March [2.

The 8:40 am. Wellington bus never showed up
that day, causing delays for over ﬁfty students.

“I had a mid-term exam at 9:45 and planned to
take the 8:40. rather than the 9:05, to give me time
to sit in the cafeteria and go over, my notes," said
one student.

"By the time the 9:05 came late, there were so
many people at Lark Street and so many on the bus
from the Wellington that I was unable to board.”
he added. ‘ .

This was not the ﬁrst time that there were pro-
blems with the Wellington. according to another
student. “1 often wait an hour and a half in'awfui
Weather for the bus that is scheduled to come every

I half hour," she said.
However, Assistant Vice President for Facilities, .

Dennis Stevens, disagreed, saying that the bus

‘ system is run as a business, and one that is efﬁcient.

The problem last Tuesday, according to Stevens
can be attributed to a breakdown of bus number 45,
which is usually used on the 8:40 run.

“The bus experienced a breakdown entailing a
broken accelerator spring and a frayed accelerator
cable 'which occurred on the 7:40 run.” Stevens
said.

He explained that the vehicle operation center
was notiﬁed within a half an hour and bus number
44 was redirected toward the Wellington.

However, when students who had walked up to
the downtown campus asked the driver of an Alum-
ni bus to use his radio to alert the dispatcher of the
problem the driver wouldn’t help.

“The driver refused to use his radio saying that
he had instructions not to use his radio except for
important messages," one student said.

Stevens explained that although a bus was
redirected, it didn’t make it to the Wellington stops
until 9:30. “By the time the bus got through trafﬁc
and all the way down to the Wellington the 8:40 bus
was deﬁnitely missed," he said. .

“inmy opinion the driver not calling was an er-
ror in judgement and the driver was counseled on
this," Stevens said.

However, he explained that the driver calling
wouldn’t have made a difference because the vehi-
cle operation center had already been notiﬁed.

“We did ﬁll in the run but not in enough time, we
did miss the run and there is no excuse for that,"
Stevens said.

This incident has triggered a change in policy for
the Wellington has run. he said. _

“We now have the number of a pay phone at the
Lark Strteet bus stop and the agreement is that if we
know a bus will not be making a run we will call the
students and warn them," Stevens said.

At the present time there are 16 buses in the ﬂeet,
including one twenty two passenger bus. However
in the last few weeks there have been up to five bus
breakdowns at a time, Stevens said.

“We regulate thirteen buses at peak time, so if
there are more than two buses out we miss runs,"
he stated.

He also explained that at the time the University
is leasing two buses from local companies to avoid
missing runs.

“These buses are very expensive, the yellow bus
costs $100 a day and the white bus costs $75 a day,"
he noted. Cl

Four. distinguished Puerto
Rican Writers and two critics
of Puerto Rican literature ad-

150 people. including many
native Puerto Ricans, in a
panel discussion entitled “The
island and the World" in the
Assembly Hall Friday
afternoon. _

The discussion was part of
the New York State Writers’
lnstitute's Puerto Rican
Writers Festival, last Thursday
and Friday, a two day event
which celebrated Puerto Rican
literature. culture. and politics.

Dr. Edna Acosta-Belen,
chair of SUNYA's Puerto
Rican. Latin American and
Caribbean Studies Depart-
ment, moderated the discus-
sion. “Puerto Rican literature
has been slighted and ignored
by literary critics in Latin
America and the United
States," said Acosta-Helen in
her 'opcning statements, and
“has often been considered too
concerned with the political
status of Puerto Rico."

The writers taking part in the
discussion, said Acosta-Belch,
have demonstrated clearly that
“good art does not necessarily
have to detach itself from
social reality."

The ﬁrst speaker on ‘lhe
panel. Luis Rafael Sanchez,
was described by Acosta Belen
as “the master of the new
generation of Puerto Rican
prose writers." Sanchez is cur-

, rently a professor of Hispanic
Studies at the University of
Puerto Rico. He asked that his
translator, Diana Velez, read
his essay “The Heart of
Mystery" because he had the
flu.

in his essay, Sanchez speaks
of the art of writing literature
and the limitless power of
words. “Terror ﬁlled and terri-
ble is the act that tries to ini-
ppse order on the limitless
space of the imaginary," read
Velez.

Rosario Ferre, considered to

 

be one of Puerto Rico's leading

dressed an audience of about

l-Puerto Rican writers lead a
people’s search for identity

women writers, was the second
speaker on the panel. in her
presentation, entitled “The
Writer’s Kitchen," Ferre told
the audience of the difﬁculties
she confronted in trying to
write her ﬁrst story, or, as she
put it. “how i brought about
my fall from the pan into the
fire of literature."

Like Sanchez, Ferre’s
presentation revealed the
author's belief in the ultimate
power of words and literature.
“1 write to convince myself
that what i love will endure.”
said Ferre.

Efrain Barrada, associate
professor at the University of
Massachusetts-Boston and a
specialist in Hispanic literature,
joined the writers. “We are the
critics, the hunter‘s of
literature," said Barradas. in
his presentation, Barradas
discussed the similarities in the
presentations of Sanchez and
Ferre, noting that both writers
rely almost blindly on words.
exhibit boldness in their use of
words and assume the world as
their own.

Pedro Juan Soto, a writer
best known in the United States
for his collection of short
stories, Spiks, followed Bar-
radas with his presentation
“The Writer as Hunter.” The
author is always in search of
the self as well as in search of
society. said Soto. “Creative
writing seldom delays in
employing the author’s own ex-
periences with regard to the
society he is part of," he said.

Emilio Diaz Valcarcel. cur-
rently a teacher of literature
and creative writing at the
Metropolitan Unviersity Col-
lege in Puerto Rico, was the
ﬁfth speaker on the panel.
Valcarcel asked that his
translator, Judith Cofer, read
his presentation "The Writer in
Puerto Rico."

Valcarcel's essay spoke
vehemently on the topic of the
Puerto Rican identity crisis; a
crisis Valcarcel believes to be a
result of the colonial relation-

MultitUde of issues eye

By Leslie ch‘W...
supp Wm

Students across New York are working
on a variety of issues In part of NYPlRG’s
recently released 1985 Legislative
Program.

NYPlRG, (New York Public interest‘

Research Group), the largest‘eonsumer
protection and environmental organiza-
tion in New York State, is planning or has
started work on such issues as proper
higher education funding. making sure low
Income families receive electricity, con-
trolling cigarette smoking in public, and
the rights of patients to see their medical
records. More than 100 proposals are
covered within NYPlRG's program.

The State Superfund, designed to pro-
vide the money needed to clean up toxic
dumps is one of the projects SUNYA stu-
dent Walt Simmons is working on. The
fund Is now bankrupt and must be
strengthened and revitalized. he said, ad-
ding that “Governor Cuomo has a bill that
has been put through Committee-for the
use of up front taxes on new chemical pro-
duction around the state." He explained
that charging up from taxes on toxic
waste: manufactured in NY is more efﬁ-
cient than the current system.

posed of “anyone concerned with toxic
waste," said Simmons. Some local en-
vironmental groups are the Human Service
Planning Council. the League of Women
Voters. and other community groups. he

explained.
Patti Herrick, NYPIRO'I Assistant

Legislative Director, said, Toxics on Tour,
a program begun by students. chose three
toxic landﬁlls to look at. By doing so.
“people got a sense of what a waste dump
looks and smells like," said Herrick. This
is a way of bringing home issues to more
people. he added.

Herrick said, “We’re trying to get these
issues down to a common ground where
people can understand them. First hand
experience is really helpful.”

Mike Oil, a student'at SUNYA, is work-
ing on the Toxic Victims Access to Justice
Campaign. NYPIRO is working to make it
possible for victims of toxic poisoning to
have the chance to sue chemical companies
for damages. Toxic chemicals usually take
10 to 30 years to show up as a disability,
but current state law requires victims to
me within three years of the time they are
exposed or else forfeit all chances for
reimbursement.

The new law would allow victims two
years from the date of discovery of their il-
lness. There would also be a revival clause.
stating that “victims who have known
they've been ill, have one year to sue from
the date the law is enacted." said Oil. to
protect people who have already
discovered their illnesses.

“Currently forty-three mm have this
clause and it doesn't make some not to

have it (in NY). We want a broad based
bill that will open up the courts to aid vie-
tims," he said.

if students want to get involved with en-
vironmental issues. they can join
NYPlRG, said Simmons. Herrick said
students interested in certain issues who
want to see things done about them can
also “write to their legislators. it can have
an effect."

“The real difficulty is that many of the
issues are a closed process," said Herrick.
adding "the legislature doesn't pursue
basic input that it could from the average
citizen."

“This year is the year that it's (Toxic
Victims) going to go through,‘ promised
Oil. The issue has now been passed by the
State Assembly four years in a row.

“if we can get a handful of these
reforms passed, we'll be satisﬁed," said
Herrick. noting that traditionally
NYPIRO's student run Board of Directors
picks a few priority issues each year.

"if people decide on an issue they care
about. they can get involved. The basic
start is for people to write to their
legislators." said Herrick. “Power in in
every citizens' hand: to change things.
Government is In good u the people want
it to be." Ci
