spectators? iaCcusati

it may have been advertised as “the sickest air- 

band ever,” but apparently most people were just
disgusted at last Saturday’s State Quad Board Air-

band ll Party.

Several people who attended the contest said that
one of the contest‘s three judges voted the way she
did because friends were on one team. and even
members of the winning band expressed surprise at

the decision.

According to Lina Malatesta, a resident assistant
on State Quad and a member of one of the bands
entered. “the judging was unfair and dishonest
because one of the judges was very good friends

with the winning group.”

“‘l'm not angry because we didn't come in ﬁrst
place. but the group that did place ﬁrst certainly
didn't deserve to,” she said. “The crowds were ap-
palled by the results, they were screaming and using -
vulgarity towards the judge that announced the'

winners." she added.

Terri Corallo. president of State Quad Board.
agreed that the audience was not pleased with the
results, but added, “The crowd can’t always be
pleased with the results of as judged contest."

The contest judges, Jackie Bernstein. sophomore
class president and previous special events chair for
State Quad. Eric Scwartzman, former State Quad
Board treasurer. and Howie Lindenbaum, present
State Quad Board treasurer were picked to judge
the contest because of their work with Quad Board.

“i tried to pick judges that were afﬁliated with
State Quad and that i thought could be objective."

Corallo said.

The bands competed for prizes of ﬁfty. thirty.
and twenty dollar certiﬁcates to the record Co-op
with ﬁrst prize going to the group “The Time,"

which performed Jungle Love.

According to Lindcnbaum. “There was not a set
system on how to pick the winner . . .
eliminated groups. then from the remaining ones
picked which we (the judges) felt the best group
was.” He added, “We talked it out until we came

to a mutual agreement."

However. Malatcsta disagreed. saying one of the
judges had more input than‘ the others. “i feel the
judging was weighted unfairly and the judge that
had the most pull was good friends with the

group. "

Bernstein disagreed. saying. "Eric, Howie and i
all had a third of a pick, the fact that i knew those

guys had no bearing," she said.

Bernstein explained that she had friends in all the
groups and that had no inﬂuence on her decision.
“l have friends in groups that did not even place."

she said.

“I just looked for what i thought was good and i
had no more authority than the other two judges,"
Bernstein stated.

Scwartzman agreed. explaining. “We all discuss-
ed it equally. Jackie had no more say than Howie or
myself." He also said neither he nor Lindenbaum
were friends with the winning group.

However, according to Bruce Putterman. an

R.A. on State Quad and a member of the group
“Berlin,” the judging was not objective. “l'felt

there were groups that were really good that didn’t
even place." The Jackson Five group was outstan-
ding and even made their own costumes, he‘added.

According to Pat DeCosta. a member of the win-

ning band, the members were surprised when they
won. "We only practiced six hours and we didn't
expect to win.” he said.

DeCosta. a friend of Bemsteln’s. said their
friendship had nothing to do with the results. “i
didn’t know either of the other judges and I don't
think she had more of a pull." he said: _ '3 J

don’t like being attacked personally for my decision
because I feel i was objective.” '

"There has never been a set system before. but
perhaps this should be changed," Lindenbsum

should have an audience-judged contest so it will be

Sexism found worse out of class

COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE College
women ﬁnd “even worse" cam-
pus sexism outside the classroom
than they do in classes. a major
college group claims.

Discrimination against female
college students by male faculty
and administrators extends
beyond the classroom and may be
more career~damaging than in-
class sex bias. the group‘s new
report charges.

in fact. sex discrimination in
financial aid of flees, and in career
counseling and employment
centers can cause women to “lose
confidence. lower their academic
goals and limit their career
choices." study authors Roberta
M. Hall and Bernice R. Sandler
claim.

The study. sponsored by the
Association of American Col-
leges’ Project on the Status and
Education of Women, follows the
some authors' earlier examination
of college classroom sex bias.

it revealed “things are even
worse outside the classroom."
when class rules no longer apply,
Hall said.

The earlier study charged male
faculty favored tnale students in
classroom situations, Hall noted.

The new report found career
and academic counselors also

often unconsciously discourage
women from taking certain male-
dominated majors. and consider
men more knowledgeable and
career-minded.

Counselors and professors also
spend less time with women
students than with men outside
the classroom, and give less en~
couragcment to women who seek
leadership posltons on campus,
the study showed.

"Younger women may enter
college expecting equal treat-
ment." Hall explained. “and
young women who have never
been employed in the workforce
are very apt not to be aware of the
differential treatment. But they’re
more likely to be demoralized by
it. ’

“Most l8-year-old girls don‘t
know what happened with the
women's movement in the sixties
and seventies," agreed Florence
Hall. educator and founder of
New York's Feminist Press. “it's
also true most l8-year-old males
don't know what's going on. The
results of the survey didn't come
as a surprise to me.”

“But it's fascinating that in
1985 we’re seeing a recurrence of
some of the. nll-too-famlllar at-
titudes that the women's move-
ment faced In the sixties." she

continued. “it‘s easy to slip
back." ‘

While older women students
often are more sensitive to sexist
behavior. and are consequently
better able to survive it. study
author Hall warned subtle
discriminationcen discourage
them, too.

“Returning women students
very often have given a great deal
of thought to their situation, like
career plans and ways in which
their sex has held them back,"
whe explained. “But it cuts both
ways."

if a severe problem persists,
such as ﬁnancial or counseling
discrimination. students should
use campus grievance procedures
or administrative channels. Hall
advised.

“The earlier study sparked a
number of campus<based
workshops. programs and con-
ferences focusing on these
issues," the said.

“The schools that were more
concerned about women did their
own studles. and found students
commenting on the chilly climate
for women outside the
classroom." Hall noted.

The comments led to the new
study. she said.

This semester is especially dif-

Osten said.

It is also easier for Greenpeace
to reach large numbers of sym-

occasionally, professors have
given extensions. but he said he
always has to do the same work as
everyone else. ‘

“Being SA president has taught
me time management." he said,
“it is the best preparation for law
school."

Laurie Midgette, chair of the
Albany State University Black
Alliance (ASUBA). said her job
“certainly involves as much work
as SA president." She said that
she works hard representing her
organization at meeting and ar-
ranging events.

“lt becomes monotonous at
times trying to maintain the
academic excellence this unvicsity
demands and to still fulﬁll social,
political and community respon-
sibilities," she admitted.

However. professors have been
understanding. she said, when she
has had to miss class for
meetings. She also described her
position as “rewarding when you
put on an event and people enjoy
themselves or learn something."
