suffering from eating disorders

By Carrie Rose
Have you ever:
>Forced yourself to vomit after eating?

pTaken laxatives after a food binge?

>Eaten large quantities of food, even though you
.aren’t hungry?

>Felt strong by not eating when you are hungry?
>Become obsessed with food, even though you
rarely eat? .

>Dieted so strictly that you lost a 
great deal of weight in a short

time? 

if you have, you are not alonel
There are thousands of women 
(and a small number of men) who are currently suf-
fering from an - eating disorder. What are these
disorders, and why have they become so common.
an experience?

There are three main types of eating disorders.
The ﬁrst, and most~visible, is anorexia nervosa. It is
recognized by a forced starvation. The anorexic
woman sees herself as obese and therefore con-
tinually denies herself food. She is often hyperac-
tive — exercising strenusously. She develops rituals
around food. She may also become obesssed with
food — collecting recipes or throwing dinner par-
ties — while simultaneously denying herself food.
By the time an anorexic is brought to medical atten~
tion, she has usually lost 25-50 percent of her nor-
mal body weight. Unless the disorder is corrected,
anorexia will be fatal.

The second disorder is much less obvious since its
victims are not so visible. The disorder is buiemia,
and it involves a vicious cycle of binging and purg-
ing. A buiemic woman is often of average weight.
She will consume thousands of calories in a binge,
and then vomit or use laxatives to relieve her guilt.
These purges can be extremely harmful medically —
damaging the stomach, esophagus, intestines, and
teeth. A buiemic is usually aware that there is a pro-
blem, but feels unable to control the cravings that
begin the‘binge.

Bulmarexia, the third disorder, is a combination
of anorexia and buiemia. Forexample, an anorexic
woman may be forcibly starving herself but she
binges one time out of hunger. in order to get rid of
the food before it is digested, she will force herself
to throw up. Bulmarexia is particulary harmful
because it is characterized by the worst of 'the two
previous disorders.

. What is common in all eating disorders is a pat-
tern of guilt associated with food intake. What has
caused the patterns to occur?

Young women...with eating disorders are often
“model” children and students. While appearing to
be achievers and responsible, the young woman
may actually .feel ineffective and powerless. With
anorexia, food is one way of asserting personal
strength. With bulemia, there is intense guilt of
feeling overcome by a hinge. " -

 

Young women with Eating
disorders are often model

I students.

 

The issue of control is then compounded by a
society that is obsessed with weight. Women seem
to be particularly affected by beauty standards.
Rather than building bodies up into physical
ﬁtness. the emphasis for women is on reducing the
body to its thinnest proportions. The media.
models, and stars tell us a very clear message —
"Thin is in.", ‘

The first step in coming to terms with an eating
disorder is to identify it, and to seek help. A
medical exam is an excellent beginning. Physical
damage can be corrected while the woman begins to
come to terms with her disorder. Treatment varies,
but the emphasis is on the woman discovering why
food has become an issue of control, what her self-
perception is, and how she can come to terms and
take responsibility. .

Support groups are. an excellent way of dealing
with an eating disorder. Middle Earth offers a sup-

port group. lt'is currently ﬁlled, but an opening, or ,

another group may occur. There are also several
groups and counselors in the Albany area. Middle

Earth encourages“ anyone who has an: eating
disorder, or is concerned about someone who does,

to call at 457-7800. Also on Thursday night at 7:30
Middle Earth is co-sponsoring_a presentation~ of

 

Foodfright. The production will focus on food and, -

our relationship to it. Anyone who is interested is .1

invited to attend.

women ’5 history week

The Feminist Alliance is offering a series

of eVents to coincide with Women's‘

History Week. “i think it’s important to
present a variety of issues that are of con-
cern to women,” said Wendy Lee Cervi. a
member of theFeminist Alliance.
Presentations will include “Abortion
from a Pro-Choice Perspective,” “issues

Conerning Marital and Date Rape,"
Gloria Anzaldua, editor of This Bridge
Called My Back, “Women and the
Development of Non-Violence," and
singer Karen Beth.

“I think it's important for women to at-
tend these events, being held next week, to
create a dialogue about these important

issues." said Cervi, adding that women

and men are welcome.

No holds barred

As pre-regislrationapproaches, students
should try to clear up any holds that may
have been placed on their records as sour
as possible. according to the university’s
registrar Thomas O’Brien.

Various administrative offices, in-
cluding Students Accounts, Student
Health Service, the library, and the trafﬁc
department. can place a hold on students’

records which can prevent them students_

from pre-registering for next semestenor
from graduating.

Lists of holds can be found outside the
Registrar’s office, the Center for
Undergraduate Education(CUE), and the
pro-registration area on Colonial Quad,
once it begins.

Leaky drain repair

The work being done on the podium to
repair leaking drains'will soon be com-
pleted, said 'Don Von Lindern, Plant
Superintendent. “Depending on the
weather, it will be completed in two to
threc'weeks,” he said. I

Presently, the drains are being water-
proofed and crushed stone is being put in.
After this, Von Lindern explained, the
concrete will be poured. Construction
began last year when problems with
leakage in the lecture centers was
discovered.

ship between Puerto Rico and

said he sees in Puerto Rico to-
day a “strong tendency
towards cultural extermina-
tion,” and, “it will be said that
the problems of com-
municaiton and identity are
also seen in other countries of
this hemisphere.” Cofer'con-‘-
tinued reading; “but these
other countries’ have at their
disposal the fountain of values
that have been officially denied
our nation." Valc‘arcel’s essay
met with great approval, as
many members of the audience
rose to their feet to applaud.

A major focus of the discus-
sion following the panel was
the question of whether or not
a writer must write in Spanish
to be considered a Puerto
Rican writer. Soto and
Valcarcel, considered part of
the "older generation" of
Puerto Rican writers, held
strongly to their position that
Puerto Rican literature must be
written in Spanish. Other
members of the panel and the,
audience disagreed forcefully.‘
many choosing to voice their
arguments in their native
Spanish.

William Kennedy, Director
of the Writers’ institute, said
he was pleased with the panel
discussion. “it’s just what i
hoped —— a discussion about
these marvelous writers that do
exist." said Kennedy.

“One reason we are here is to
let the world know about Puer-
to Rican literature," said Pro-
fessor Tom Smith. ‘Associate
Director of the Writers’ in-
stitute. “They live in this kind
of limbo because of their rela-
tionship with the United States
and no one thinks of them as
having a culture of their own,"
said Smith. But, the purpose of
the panel discussion and the
Puerto Rican Writers Festival
is to clear up some of these
myths about Puerto Rican
culture and to raise the ques-
tion of Puerto Rican identity,
he added. Cl

But more than research is
necessary. Florence Hall argued.

Only one-third of ‘all colleges
provide specialized child. health
care and crisis center services. and
even fewer offer a full range of
these services, she said.

“it's important we remind
ourselves that the effort to build
coed education is not corn-
plcted." she added. L]
