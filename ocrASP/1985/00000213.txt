~ . Riverside, CA.
(College Press Service) The church-
sponsored sanctuary movement, aiding
refugees ﬂeeing to the US. from War-torn
Central America, is gaining a potentially
new ally: college students. '

Although still in the embryonic stage,
efforts are burgeoningto establish a cam-
pus sanctuary network to help harbor El
Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees in
deﬁance of federal authorities: ‘

-At least three university student
organizations in California have voted
within the past year to establish
sanctuaries. - » .

Representatives of l2 other California
schools are considering similar steps
following a Riverside conference last
month to establish the foundation for a
campus sanctuary network.

-Brown University students, who last
fall approved a referendum calling on the
university to establish a sanctuary, are
working with local churches to set up a
sanctuary after university officials failed to
respond. ‘

-A University of Colorado student
organization aiding Central American
refugees will ask student government
leaders later this month to establish a
sanctuary.

Combined with the dozen or so campus-
affiliated churches that are already part of
a ZOO-member nationwide network of
church-sponsoered sanctuaries, sanctuary
movement leaders as convinced they are
beginning to tap a mother-lode of
resources and support.

“The educational impact alone could be
tremendous," said Rev. Herb Schmidt,
pastor of. the Lutheran Campus Ministry
at the University of Arizona, Which runs a
sanctuary. “Some of these refugees have
literally escapes with their lives and when



said.

A network of campus sanctuaries last
operated to protect draft dodgers during
the Vietnam War. _ .

UC-Riverside graduate student Deborah
Allen, who helped organize last month's
campus sanctuary conference, is convinced

the sentiments that led to the Vietnam War,

era sanctuaries can be tapped again.‘

“College students may be a little less
progressive now," Allen said, adding that,
while the progressive students may be a
minority, they're a strong minority. “And
students will get involved once they realize
they can actually do something concrete to
prevent refugees from being deported or
killed," she added.

Joan Cardellino, who coordinates sanc-
tuary support efforts for the garduate stu~
dent government at Cal-Berker said,
“Students In this country take their
political freedom for granted. When they
realize that university students in El
Salvador, who are key targets of repres-
sion, get killed for doing much less than
they do, they say ‘Maybe i should be doing
something about that.‘ ”

Up to now, the five-yar-old movement
to protect refugees from deportation has
been run almost entirely by churches. '

“It’s alWays been thought of as a
religious movement," Allen said, trying to
explain why college students have been
slow to get involved. “But this is a moral
and humanitarian imperative,” she said.
adding, “you don't have to belong to a
church to believe the 0.5. government is
breaking its own laws by deporting these
people." .

Sanctuary movement leaders maintain

'the estimated 600,000 Salvadorans and

Guatemalans illegally in the US. are
political refugees ﬂeeing from the cIvil

wars in their countries. and are therefore ,

 

siders the vast‘majority to be economic
refugees. It has been rejecting all but a

> small fraction of asylum requests, and it is

prosecuting people aiding the refugees.

in January, officers arrested 16
workers, including some muns and priests,
in Arizona. Last month, two lowa sanc-
tuary workers were convicted of aiding
Salvadoran refugees. « .

College students who aid refugees
directly face the prospect of prosecution.
but campus sanctuary movement leaders
say that is unlikely. .

“We are prepared to take the risk," said
Allen, adding that, “there is an awful lot
of sanctuary work that can be done that
does not involve risks."

The campus sanctuary members
organize food and fund drives. provide
bail money for jailed refugees, and arrange
campus appearances of refugees who
describe life in their home campus groups.

According to Allen, the Riverside group
began its sanctuary work after indications
from the immigration and Naturalization
Service that it would not raid churches.
schools, or hospitals in search of illegal
aliens. “That planted the seed,” Allen

' said.

The graduate Student Council at UC-
Riverside voted in February, 1984 to
establish a sanctuary. Since then, students
have housed one refugee, and given
various forms of assistance to others.,

The graduate student assembly at UC-
lrvine followed suit in August, the.
assembly at UC~Berkeley in October.

According to Allen, Riverside students '
are establishing a newsletter for college
sanctuary members, and are preparing a
“how to" booklet for those interested in
establishing a sanctuary. She expects at
least I0 college sanctuaries will be in
operation by next fall. Cl
