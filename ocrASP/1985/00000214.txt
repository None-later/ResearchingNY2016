SA contoller Richard Golubow stated
that SA “has no intention of raising the
fee here at Albany."

Golubow stated that he felt that SUNY
Central raised the activity fee because
“other campuses are operating in deficit
budgets" and need the extra money in
order “to keep stability.".

According to Golubow, SUNY Cen-
tral's actions “gives us(SA) more leeway.
if we wanted to raise the fee, we wouldn't
have to apply for a waiver."

Golubow added that SA is not running
on a deficit and is financially secure..
Therefore, he said he does not see “a need
for any raise in the activity fee in the near
future.”

towards business." .
“What is unique ‘about the

' open house is that Fuerza Latina

did it all by themselves. They con-
tacted the right people, and got
transportation to run smoothly,”
said Tripp. The students travelled
upstate by van.

Cruz said that Fuerza Latina
attempted to get representatives
from many academic depart-
ments. “They either didn't res-
pond, or they said they couldn’t
come," she said. The only
academic department which at-
tended was the School of Social
Welfare, which was represented
by Dr. Lester Brown.

Brown spoke in general terms
about his department, the oppor-
tunities of community service,
and campus life. Brown said that
he was pleased to attend, and
hoped that the students would
consider social welfare as a ma-
jor, and social work as .an
occupation. ' ,

Following panel discussion.
there was a short break during
which the students mingled
casually and discussed their im-
pressions of SUNYA. High
School Junior Juanita Amarante

said that the discussion was very-

informative. Amarante Was one
of several students interested in

the business school. Most of the.

students said'that they were im-
pressed and hoped to attend the
University. '

f‘l’nt a little shocked," said
Kenny Agosto. “I thought that
college was just like Animal
House. it seems like the movies
aren’t true." For the most part.
the students said they had never
visited a college outside New
York City. “We wanted to get

 

1

them into a different environment
for one day," said Velez.

Tripp remarked that minority
recruitment at SUNYA began of-
ficially four years ago. “We con-
duct ongoing active recruitment."
said Tripp, “and this is not a one-
shot deal event with no history to
it. We recently held a similar open
house seminar for guidance
counselors from New York City
and surrounding counties. They
represent about 40,000 students."

Students admitted into the
University have other‘decisions to
make once they are matriculated,
said Gwendolyn Simmons, of the
Career Development Center.
"We give you direction," said
Simmons, “and gear you towards
an eventual entering into the job
market. If you’re considering
graduate school, work, and your
future in general, CDC will be
there to guide you," she said.

The last phase of the activities
in LC19 Was a presentation by
Rich Schaffer, Student Associa-
tion President. Schaffer spoke
about the many opportunities for
involvement on campus. “1 give
you the same‘ message i give to in-
coming freshmen —— get involv-
ed," said Schaeffer.

Jasmin Perez asked Schaffer
about art clubs on campus. Perez,
ansrtist, was curious about the

Schaffer assured her that there

are an clubs on campus.
However, Perez noted, “The
studios here are only open to
graduate students. The facilities
for undergrads that i saw were
not to my liking." ‘
Perez continued, “This is why
I'm glad that the open house took
placetoday. This way i can see
first hand whether the school is
good or not. For me, it‘s not. All
of my questions have been

answered. "

Most of the visiting students
kept their negative comments to
themselves, however, and concen-
trated instead on the positive
aspects of what they had seen and
learned. “1 think that school is
great. These are a great bunch of
poeple here,” said the father of
one prospective SUNYA appli-
cant. They were the only parents
to attend.

One student said, “i feel very
good about Albany. i feel need-
ed, and I certainly want to go to a
school where I’m needed.”

Torres, who made the con-
cluding'remarks to the students
onbehalf of Fuerza Latina said.
“I’m here at Albany because i
‘o'okat my parents and l know i
want a better life. i want to help
them, and especially help myself.
I have a responsibility to use my
opportunities to advance myself.

COLLEGE PRESS SERVlCE
Student's hunting for a scholar-
ship to help ﬁnance their col-
lege education are better off us-
ing the guides at their local
library than paying for a com-
puterized search of what’s
available. the authors of a re-
cent study concluded.

The California Student Aid
Commission (CSAC) surveyed
30vcomputer scholarship search
firms that promise to help
students find obscure sources
of financial aid by matching
their skills and needs with little-
known scholarship programs.

“While these ﬁrms are not
out to rob students, we can’t
recommend any of them,”
CSAC
McNally said. “it’s a good

idea, but it hasn't worked yet," '

she added.

The scholarship search firms
came into vogue in the wake of
reports, many of them planted
by the search services
themselves, that there are
millions of dollars in unclaimed
scholarships every year.

But, according to CSAC
Director Arthur Marmaduke.
most of the unclaimed funds
are restricted, and are not

available to the average
student. '
Daniel Cassidy of San

Rafael, Cal., founder of one of
the ﬁrst computerized scholar-
ship services, said the CSAC
study is an accurate reﬂection
of the industry as a whole.
though not of his firm.

spokeswoman Lois,

mation from the best ﬁrms, he
added.

The better firms, Cassidy
said, maintain their own com—
puterized list of scholarships,
rather than relying on a list
mass marketed by a New Jersey
company.

in addition, Cassidy said,
some 'firms offer students
guarantees or refunds.

But the CSAC study, releas-
ed Feb. l4th, concluded that:
-— The vast majority of the
ﬁrms use the same computeriz-
ed list of scholarships.

— Many customers receive a
list of scholarships not suited to
their background.

— The guarantees offered by
most firms are inadequate.

—- Most firms do not contact
their customers to see how
many find scholarships.

Cassidy said his l982 survey
of his firm's customers in-
dicated that. of the students
who contacted the scholarship
agencies his' ﬁrm recommend-
ed, about half received a
scholarship of at least $100.

But, CSAC surveyed l5 Los
Angeles students who paid
scholarship ﬁrms, and found
none who got'any ﬁnancial
assistance.

McNally said CSAC is cir—
culating a list of readily-
available reference books
listing scholarship programs,
and is urging high school
counselors to refer students to
those guides instead of paying
for a computerized search of
scholarships.
