Fightin’ullii’ni has Georgia.

Tech’s Cremins worried

(AP) Despite an impressive victory over
No. 15 Syracuse to advance to the NCAA
East Regional semifinals Thursday night,
Coach Bobby Cremins of sixth-ranked
Georgia Tech says he‘s “scared stiff" of
Big Ten power lllinois.

Tech, 26~7, reached the NCAA's round
of 16 finalists with a 70-53 triumph over
Syracuse Sunday at the Omni after No.12
lllinois routed 19th-ranked Georgia 74-58
earlier in the day.

The Yellow Jackets, the Atlantic Coast
Conference champions, will meet Illinois
in Providence, R.l.. in one half of a
doubleheader Thursday night. Top-ranked
Georgetown faces No. 14 Loyola, Illinois,
in the single-elimination tournament that
began with 64 teams.

“i didn’t think I‘d be sitting here talking
to you as a winner," Cremins told a news
conference following the victory Sunday.
“It was an unbelievable win. The score
was no indication of the type game it
was.ll ' . .

. Tech led 28-27 at the half and gradually
increased its margin to 50-40 on a three-
point play by Yvon Joseph with 7:27 to
play and the Orangemen never got closer
than nine points.

Mark Price led Tech with 18 points with
Joseph adding 17 and John Salley con~
tributing 13. , '

“Our big guys, Salley and Joseph, came
through in the second half ," Cremins said
of the 'duo that helped the Yellow Jackets
domirfate the boards with a 38-24 advan-
tage rover Syracuse and force the
Orangemen to shoot only 39.6 from the
field. ,. .

Turitlng to Illinois, Cremins continued
his season-long pattern of the eternal
pessimist. ,

“l'm scared stiff of lllinois right :now.

was surprised by the, Georgia score. I
thought it would go down to the wire.”

As it turned out Georgia never was in
the game against the Fighting lllini after a
16-15 deﬁcit became a‘nightmare at 32-15.
lllinois reeled off 16 straight points as the
Bulldogs went scoreless for a nine-minute
stretch late in the first half.

Doug Altenberger, who had 14 of his 16
points in the opening half, triggered the 11-
lini spurt with eight points. Georgia never
got closer than 10 points as lllinois built
lead as large as 22 points. Efrem Winters
led Illinois, 26-8, with 19 points and Ken
Norman added 15. Georgia, 22-9, got 17
points from Joe Ward and 13 from Cedric
Henderson.

“i thought we played a very good. game,
especially on the boards and on defense."
said lllinois Coach Lou Henson. Georgia,
which averaged 77 points a game during
the season, had only 19 at halftime.

“We had planned to alternate our
defense. and use the zone to‘keep us out of
foul trouble. But when Georgia struggled
with the outside shot. we decided to stay
with the zone," he said.

Georgia never could hit from outside
and struggled to get' the ball inside.
shooting only 39 percent in the first half on
nine of 23 shots. Meanwhile,» Illinois tired
away at a 54.5 percent clip. ,,

“Each player picked the others up both
offensively and defensively," Altenberger
said. "I thought I played agr'eat ﬁrst half,
and then in the second half- Efrem and the
other guys were great.” .-‘ 7

“We, were in the game at 16-15 and then
ran off, I don‘t know how manypoints to
go up 34-17 or something‘like' that," said
Georia Coach Hugh Durham. “That
basically was the game. " D
