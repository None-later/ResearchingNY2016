The Final Four cbuld be an all-Big East *atfa‘ir

(AP) The Big East and Atlantic Coast
Conferences have been feuding all season
over which league is the best in college
basketball, and their performances in the
first two rounds of the NCAA Tourna-
ment have done nothing to settle the issue.

Both leagues will have four represen-
tatives in the regional semiﬁnals this week.
In fact, the Final Four could be an all-Big
East shootout involving top-ranked
Georgetown, No. 3 St. John’s, Villanova
and Boston College.

That is not possible for the ACC.

however. since seventh-ranked North
Carolina and Maryland are both in the
Southeast Regional. The ACC's other en-
tries are No. 6 Georgia Tech and No. l6

V North Carolina State.

The Southeastern Conference is the only
other league with more'ihan one represen-
tative still left - Alabama, Auburn and
Kentucky.

“The Big East is keeping the kids in
their area, nobody is going to take kids out
of our area and you’ve got the SEC. which
used to be a football conference. and

Potsdam ousted in finals

(AP) Less than three minutes remained in
the NCAA Division III basketball cham-
pionship game and North Park Illinois had
just fallen behind for the first time.

North Park Coach Bosco Djurickovie
had watched his team blow a 13-point
lead. Potsdam State N.Y. had a 61-59 edge
and the national championship. it seemed,
was slipping away from North Park.
Djurickovie called time ou't.

“Playing 80 minutes in two days is an
awful lot and my kids were tired,” said
Djurickovie after Saturday’s game. “But I
told them there were only three minutes
left and. if we've got it to give. let's give it
all we can."

The pep talk apparently worked as
North Park rallied behind tournament
Most Valuable Player Earnest Hubbard to
take a 71—67 lead and then held on for a
72-7! victory. .

It was North Park's fourth Division III
crown in eight years, including three
straight from 1978-80.

“We'll have to slide our other three ban-
ners over to the left a little," said
Djurickovie, who was an assistant coach
under Dan McCarrcll when North Park
joined UCLA as the only schools to win

Athletic Association championships.

Hubbard, a senior guard. drove the lane
for a layup and a short jumper in the final
l:09 to fuel North Park’s comeback. He
ﬁnished with 29 points.

“Our coach really deserves this," said
Hubbard. “He got the best out of the
talent we had. This is the happiest moment
of my life. especially being named MVP."

Potsdam Coach Jerry Welsh applauded
Hubbard's performance, but steered the
credit toward North Park’s other senior
guard, Adam Lazich. who scored 18 points
on eight-of~10 shooting.

“Lazich made the difference,” said
Welsh. “We needed to cover Hubbard and
center Justyne Monegain, so we cheated a
little inside and gave Lazich the outside
shot. He sure buried some."

Both teams were making their fourth ap-
pearances in the finals since the tourna-
ment began in I975. Potsdam won it in

When first glancing at junior
Brian Solomon. you wouldn't
guess that his hands are registered
as legal weapons. His mild man'-
nered appearance and good
‘natured personality don't reveal
the fact that his hands posess a
lethal power. It wouldn't be wise
to confront this second degree
black belt from Staten Island.

closest goal for the future will be
to receive his third degree black
belt in I987. There are ten degrees

for blackbelts in karate and when -

asked if ’he would go for all ten

way up slowly, it takes a long time

- each degree takes one more year ,

than it took to earn the last

martial arts in 1978 when he was
14 years old. “A friend of mine
was doing it at home and he was
getting pretty. good,” , said
Solomon. “He wasn’t the type of
person that you’d think studied
karater So I decided to join.
That’s just what got me started
though, front the first day I went
to class I’ never ever thought of
quitting. From the ﬁrst day I
worked out I loved it."

Karate involves self-
perseverance, and discipline o
one’s heartand mind must be
devoted to the sport. Martial ar-
tists aren’t motivated by televi-
sion programs or a'desire to ﬁght
because they've gotten'beateit up
at one point in their lives. In fact.
most martial artists will avoid us-
ing their techniques on anyone
unless absolutely necessary.

To receive, a black belt. one
must take a three part test. The
written test includes the history of

karate. the oral test is based on ‘

theory, and the physical part is
demonstrating what you've learn-
ed in workouts. ‘

Solomon works out daily —
three times a week with the
Albany State Taekwonda club
and the other four days a week
with friends in the gym or his
lounge in Indian’s Montauk Hall.
When asked if it was'hard to keep
up his grades the criminal justice
majdr replied, “No, I use my
workouts as study breaks.

“A good workout will last two
hours so I'll take the time - work-
ing out. clears my mind so I can
get myself ready to study again. I
think it helps‘a lot, as a matter of
fact when I ﬁrst started my grades

Solomon is in karate for‘the
pleasure of it. ‘fl could compete if
I wanted to but I don't have the
desire to." said Solomon, whose
nickname is ‘Karate Kid' among
his ‘friends.“Most of the tour-~

nutrients are too far away, poorly

run' and expensive. You could
wait four hours before your turn ,



to .fight, lose and be out of the
tournament in a matter of
minutes. If they were closer or at
the school I would compete out of
convenience and curiouslty < to
compare myself with other people
out there”,

Solomon has taught karate in
his school at home and he hopes
to teach in the future. “If the op-
portunity arose to teach here on
campus and the class was big I
would. I enjoy teaching and it
would be good for now to prepare
if I have my own school one day -
I'd be ..ready for it.” said
Solomon, “To start a club on
campus a constitution has to be

written up and-everything ls ar-
ranged through the gym. It would 4

be somewhat of a hassle but I may
consider doing it next year."

Most of the clubs here are run
by students or former students.
“The club I’m in now isn’t my
style. Ijust work-out with them:
I’m more of a guest than a stu-

stated. “But just because the class
is the same style doesn't mean it’s
as good ~ it’s really the people that
are in it that make it. All of us
who work out together get along
great."

While the majority of students
of karate are men, there are a few
women involved also. “I think
it‘s great when women‘ become in-

A saying in karate is “when
you ﬁrst make black belt is when
you first start beginning to
learn." “That was true when I
made it." stated Solomon,
“Things that I learned earlier
started coming together." There
aren't many black belts on cam-
pus because many students just
started attending classes once they
come to school here and it takes a
few years to earn a black belt.
You don't have to be a hulk to be
a black belt. A lot of people in my
school aren't big people and I
wasn't big when I started either,"
said Solomon. “Karate builds a
lot of strength — both physically
and mentally, and I would
definitely recommend it to
anyone.” [3

Dane skaters finish_season with 8-7-1 record

By Rachel Braslow

The Albany State hockey club set some
goals for themselves this past season.
Among them were a winning season.
recruiting. and lots of hard work. These
words all proved true as the twenty
member "team" compiled an 8-7-1 record
this season. '

“I think this season was the initial
season of having a hockey team here at
Albany State.” said co-captain sophomore
Larry Hartman. “It was pretty Incredible
to finish with a .500 record."

Now one may wonder why the hockey
team is technically a club. The primary

 

 

reason for this is that they are SA funded
and not athletically funded. The team
members pay $100 each for the season to
cover the cost of external equipment such
as jerseys and hockey pucks. ' '

The club started as an- intramural
hockey club in I98]. Its membership grew
and last year marked the ﬁrst steps
towards an intercollegiate season. This
year the “team” was asked to participate
in the Mohawk Valley Conference. The
conference includes Mohawk Valley Com-
munity College. Le Moyne College, Clin-
ton College, Sienna College, and the
Adirondack Jr. Red Wings.



 

  
   

DAVE IIMC UPS
The Albany State Hoekoy Club, In It. second year, posted an 8-7-1 record this
season.

The season opened November 2 as
Albany State captured its own first annual
Albany State Ice Hockey Tournament. Ac-
cording to Team Director senior Paul
Essner, “This was the highlight of the
season winning the tournament and
beating Mohawk Valley Community Col-
lege, 4-2."

In comparison with last year’s season
Essner said: “There is no comparison. The
organization was disorganized and there
was a lot of team apathy;-This year there
are lots fo freshman, the whole team
outlook is ﬁrm. We’ve come to stay.”

Outstanding team members included
freshman John Franz, Mike Mondiello
and Tom Wu sophomores Hartman and

‘Mark Tisdel combine with junior co-
.captain Rich Diem, juniors Pete Leskody

and goaltender Jim Leskody, who Essner

,calls “a rock in the net," for a strong

team.

Unfortunately, the team will be losing
high scoring senior forward John Knab,
who Essner termed “a very intense player
and asset to the team," along with senior
goaltender Drew Rubin to graduation.
Seniors Scott Janicola and Essner will
graduate in December.

Team injuries prevented even better per--
formanccs. Jeff Korcntur suffered a neck
injury at the Adirondack Game.‘ During
February. Essner tore ligaments while
teammate Pete Leskody chipped a bone in
his ankle. Wu broke his wrist and had to
sit out the first semester.

The team was also forced to go through
two coaches. First semester coach Jim
Cavanngh was forced to resign because of
a job transfer. For the second semester

Bruce Pomaky took over as head coach.
Despite injuries, a lack of funding. no

home ice rink and a turnover of coaches,

Essner declared, “We've come further

than any other team in their second

season, there is so much desire to succeed.
so much team cohesiveness."

As to the future of the team Hartman
said. “I think the sky is the limit. Basical-
ly, we have a lot of young talent.

Nevertheless, the struggle for athletic
funding continues.

According to Athletic Director Dr.
William Moore. the hockey program still
has a way to go before attaining varsity
status. A club is first established, followed
later on by petitioning to become a varsity
sport. The club must appear before the
Revenue Policy and Athletic Planning
Board comprised of students and faculty
members chaired by Vice President of
University Affairs Mr. Lewis Welch.

To fund a team, revenue approximated
at between $20,000 and $30,000 would be
needed. Thus an additional appropriation
of money towards the athletic budget
would be necessary to begin funding.

Moore added that there are plans for a
new field house at Albany State, but not
for a hockey facility. “As far as I know
there are no plans for an ice rink. said
Moore. “ The current plan was cut down
from its original scope which assumed a
possibility for the ice rink. The present
plan has determined for the coming years
what has been allocated for what, this
didn't include a rink." '

Nevertheless. Moore said the possibility
fo an ice rink could still be considered, but
it would not likely be reasonably soon. [I]
