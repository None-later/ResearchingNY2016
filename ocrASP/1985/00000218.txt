posed slowing down most leasing of off-

fering acreage in waters off the Pacific
Northwest for the first time in 27 years.

years instead of one every other year in
areas outside the Gulf of Mexico. Sales in
Ithe central and western gulf would con-
‘tinuc to be held every year.

The current schedule. which took effect
in l982. calls for 41 sales through June
1987. The draft proposed today lists 43.
but five are to be re-offerings of rejected
tracts. Eleven of the offerings scheduled in
1982 subsequently were delayed and are
listed in the new to ram.

have a new budget in place 'for the start of
the fiscal year April 1. '

The budget talks were “deadlocked”
and “we have a stalemate." said state
Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink. D-

Gordonto resume‘duties as prof

By Ken Dornbaum
STAFF WRITER ‘ A

After meeting with Professor Vivian
Gordon. former chair of the African and
Afro-American Studies Department.
Wednesday. President Vincent O’Leary
announced that Gordon would resume her
full faculty responsibilities no later than
Monday. March 25. y

“l emphasized to Professor Gordon that
issues concerning the position of Chair of
the Department...were unrelated to her.
scholarship and teaching.” sald'O'Leary.
“I am pleased that she will return to the
classroom." ..

“With respect to the position of Chair.
after an extensive discussion with Pro-
fessor Gordon.... 1 concluded that Dr.
Gordon should not return as Chair of the
Department." said O'Leary. adding that
Dr. Julius Thompsbn would continue as
Acting Chair. “1 wish it to be clearly
understood that this decision was based

‘solcly on my assessment of the manage-

ment needs of this Department and in no
way reflects on Dr. Gordonfs scholar-
ship....” he said. 1

Gordon. an associate professor in the
department. resigned March 6 at the re-
quest of John Webb. Dean of the School
of Social Sciences. Gordon assumed the
chair in September, l984 after being head
of the Black Studies program at the
University of Virginia. ‘

O’Leary also found “that we need to ar-
ticulateand reaffirm the goals" of the
department. “and to ensure that broad
University support for this department is
strengthened.“ O'Leary and other of-
ficials could not be reached for comment
on what the department weaknesses ac-
tually are.

formed at the request of Hamilton. “His
feeling was that advisement had been
around for a long time and noone had ex-
amined what advisement was about."
Reich said. "We wanted to arrive at some
kind of model for good adviSement. a
statement of what advisement should be at
SUNY Albany." she said. _
Hamilton asked the committee to focus

on departmental advising. “In general we

mittee as consultants.

“The first of these is Professor Joseph
Russell of the University of Indiana." said
O'Leary. Russell is the Director of the Na-
tional Council for Black Studies. “Several
more (consultants) will be invited." he
said.

After her resignation. Gordon requested
administrative leave to work on two
research projects. Her classs were being
taught by guest lecturers.

Students in Gordon’s classes were less
than pleased with Gordon‘s temporary
departure and students enrolled in her
classeswent to Webb‘s office to demand
that someone teach their . classes. said
senior Michael Zaretsky. -

“The guest lecturers were fine." said
one student. "but it wasn't the same as
Professor Gordon." Site added that she
was very happy that Gordon was return-
ing. [1

can do a better job of advising. so i was
looking for a definition of what advising
should be on the departmental level." he
said.' . '

Reich explained that the committee
“looked concretely at what happens at an
advisement encounter. drawing on our ex-
periences.“ The report which defines rid-
visement also details what students and ad-
visors should expect of each' other in the
advisement meetingand includes a list of
recommended improvements.

“l was very pleased with the commit-
tce‘s report.” said Mike Miller. Central
Council Academic. Affairs Committee
Chair. “it was pretty comprehensive. it
was a good first step." he added.

“The report can have a positive impact
on advising." Central Council Academic
Affairs Grievance Chair Larry Harttnan
agreed. "it can be helpful. but only if the
recommendations are accepted.“ he add-
ed. Hartman was the only student par-
ticipating on the Committee.

Miller cited as significant the Commit-
tee's recommendation that the administra—
tion offer incentives and rewards related to
tenure. protnotion and discretionary pay
increases for good academic advising.
"One of the problems is that there is too
much emphasis here on research. The
faculty should be rewarded for good ad-
visement." he said.

Another of the problems. Reich added.
is that “faculty aren't even trained to
teach. tnuch less advise."

For this reason. Reich continued. the
committee recommended some fortn of
training for faculty advisers. “By offering
at least tninimal training sessions. we can
raise the level of competency in advising."
site said.

"in sotne ways. the report reflects a
dissatisfaction over the way students are
approaching advisement." Reich said.
“We still see some students who are ttot
taking responsibility for their educational
lives. They expect ttdvisors to set goals for
them ttttd then tell them how to reach those

Albany begins
enforcement
of grouper law

By J. Michael Malec
STAFF WRITER

Despite promises that Albany's
“grouper law" would not be enforced
until this fall. city ofﬁcials have already
begun prosecuting some student
landlords.

On April l8th Jasmine See will go on
trial in Albany Police Court for alledged
violation of the grouper law. according
to Albany Code Enforcement Director.
Michael Alvaro.

Subpeonae are going out to tenants in
the case. he said. adding ‘ ‘the amount of
cooperation we (Code Enforcement)
receive in this matter will dictate our
future actions in such cases."

Alvaro noted that in such cases in the
. past. tenants (students) ltave been given
. the “benefit of the doubt" and allowed
. to remain in their apartment; until the
end of the semester. but he said if
students chose to ignore subpconae. and
do not assist the City in the case. the Ci-
ty will be forced to “relocate” them.

Dr. Frank Poguc. Vice President for
Student Affairs. expressed some sur-
prise at Alvaro’s statement. saying “i
don't know why Alvaro would say
that." Poguc said Albany City
understands the Univesity's housing
shortage. and has some sensitivity to
respond with caution in such cases.
“The City has agreed it will not evict
students unless they first consult with
the University. So far. i have not receiv-
ed a call." he said.

Pogue said further. he has some
assurance that the City does not plan to
remove any students, even if the
landlord is in violation. unless the viola—
tiott is very flagrcnt.

Three recent grouper law cases have
been settled without trial. Martin
Goldsmith. of Hilcrest Avenue.
Schenectady was cited.for allowing 14
students to live in a three apartment
house at 407 Hudson Ave.; he was fined
$300.

Harris Jacobson. of Rosemonl Ave..
was cited for allowing eight persons to
live in a two unit building at 808
Washington Ave.. attd allowing others
to occupy illegal attic and basement
apartments: he was fined $300.

Citing Chen. of Manning Blvd.. was
cited for violations at 456. 458. and 489
Hudson Ave.. and 464. 468. 474 and 493
Hatnilton St. All are two fatnily. three
bttildings. but each ttttit is occupied by 4
persons. with an additional bedroom
carved ottt of the livingroom. Mrs. Chen
was fined $350. and given until June
first to remove the illegal bedrooms.

in all of these cases. the students liv-
ing in the buildings were given until May
‘ 3| to comply with the law, insuring that
lthey have a place to live for the rest of
the semester. according to Alvaro.

The reason these landlords were cited.
I -\lvnro said. despite the City's stated
policy of not enforcing the law until the
fall. was that the citations were in
response to complaints from citizens.
“We can‘t ignore complaints." he said.

Speaking about more general enforce—
mm of the grouper law in the fall.
Alvaro said the City would'not move to
seek Certificates of Occupancies (CO's)
for ttll apartments to ensure compliance.
“We have only ten inspectors for the
whole city." said Alvaro. “if we tried to
require CO's. we just don‘t have the
manpower to do it."

Alvaro added that CO’s are often re-
quired by purchasers of rail estate. bttt
il‘ a seller wants ottc. he must pay a fee
for the inspection. since Code Enforce-
tncnt is so understaffed.

According to Alvaro's figures. tltcrc
is one inspector for each approximately
3.000 nnitsol‘ housing in the city. i I
