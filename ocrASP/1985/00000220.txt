At the mention of the term
“Green party.” ntost students
would probably look back at this
past weekend and try to figure out
which St. Patrick’s Day party is

being talked about. Political
Science Professor Carl F.
L a n k 0 w s k i

however, will '

most likely 
reflect on the 

current poltical
s y s t c 'm i n
modern West Germany.

Lankowski spoke about his
research on the Green party
Wednesday evening at a lecture
presented by the German Club.
entitled “The Greens: Germany
and the Volatile Political
Situation."

The Greens are the “party of
Bewahren,“ representing
“politics of the first person —
participatory politics." said
Lankowski. They gave Germans
“a totally different perspective in
what politics is all about," he
said.

According to Lankowski. the
Green party differs from other
German political parties in that it
is trying to bring about social
change and achieve the “realiza-
tion of a concrete Utopia."

The Green party is becoming an
important issue in international
affairs. Lankowski said. “The
Greens are being emulated
elsewhere; they are picking up
steam in other countries." He ad-
ded that the party represents a
“political decoupling from the
U.S." and is a “major irritant"
in American foreign policy.

The party represents a "political decoupling from the U.S. ”

The party began as a protest
movement. and early issues for
the Greens included the building
of nuclear reactors and other
issues which pertained to the en-
vironment. Lankowski said. The
Greens argue that the German
government has not imposed
needed regulations to protect the
environment, such as emission
control standards on cars, he
explained.

The Green party has since ex-
panded its platform to include in-
ternational affairs. They current-
ly support the German
withdrawal from NATO and the
elimination of the new U.S. Per-
shing and cruise missiles being
deployed in Europe.

Lankowski said members ofthe
Green party that hold office tend
to merely haggle the government
ruled by the opposing political
parties. They prefer to point out

the failings of the system, but do
not come up with new policies, he
said. '

Every level of political office
has a Greens representative. but
their stronghold has been in more
local positions. Lankowski said.
adding that there are 2.000 to
2,500 Green party members who
were elected to local offices, such
as a town council.

“Greens are represented in six
of the it federal states. and in
Hessen (one of the larger states).
They hold enough seats to decide
which of the other two major
parties holds control of the parlia-
ment,” Lankowski said.

The party began with a young
generation and is currently grow-
ing larger as it absorbs a larger
percentage of the population.
Lankowski said. “Early party
voters." he said. “went to the
'Greens because they had nowhere

else to go."

The average Green party
member, Lankowski said, is
“middle-class, educated, and
young." They are “exactly those
who beneﬁtted from a policy of
strong economic growth." which.
ironically, is the cause of many
environment .i.problems. he said.
' “Students are the troops of the
party." Lankowski said. “They
are becoming more and more im-
portant. They have time.” Since
the Green party is a low budget
group, he said, students and

teachers often do the required

footwork, such as running the
campaigns.

in comparing the Green party
to a group such as New York
Public Interest Research Group.
Lankowski said the only dif-

‘ference is that NYPIRG tends to

seek reform in government.
whereas the Green party usually
rejects government policy.
“While NYPIRG would try to ﬁx
a car. the Greens would simply re-
ject it."

During the 19605. the average
West German was “politically
passive" and government was left

. to be run by the "elitists." said

Lankowski. The l970s. however;
brought a “change that coincides
with a new social movement, star-
ting with political involvement
itself." he said.

Lankowski spent calendar year
1984 based in Konstanz. West
Germany, studying they Green
party and its organization. “The
Greens have become the third

. strongest party in Germany, and

therefore must be considered im-
portant in all political issues." he

Lankowski began teaching at
SUNYA in Fall 1982 and teaches.
a. variety of courses in the
Political Science Department. His
previous research includes work
for the European Community in
Brussels in 1977-78 on Germany's
economic role in European.
affairs.

It was this research which
sparked his interest in the Green
party and why he applied for last
year’s research project on the
Greens.

When asked to comment on the .
issue of professors' dual role of

teaching the conducting research.
Lankowski replied, “I am a firm
believer in the value of teaching.
One shouldn’t do things to‘ under-
mine that area.” Professors, he
said. should be rigorous in order
to challenge students and depart-
ments should decide whether pro-
fessors will teach or do research.
“They should not be expected to
do both full time,” he said. ,

Lankowski studied at
Georgetown University and
received his Doctorate from Col-
umbia in 1980. He Specialized in
American foreign policy in
Europe. because it is "the tradi<
tionai center of focus for U.S.
foreign policy."

Lankowski’s research was
sponsored and funded by the
Social Democratic party (SPD).
West Germany's second strongest
political party. Lankowski is cur-
rently documenting his research
on the Green party in The Greens
ol‘ Konstanz, which he expects to
be completed by the end "of this‘
year. El

Students will have. a chance to express their opinion on
a nuclear freeze when they vote in the Spring Election's
next month. 1

Central Council, in its Wednesday night meeting. voted
to put the referendum on the ballot by unanimous con-
sent. The referendum asks students to vote yes or no on
whether the United States should negotiate a' mutually
veriﬁable nuclear freeze with-the Soviet Union.

Council also voted in favor of paying workers to
distribute tax stickers at preregistration, and a harass-
ment suit against a University Cinemas ofﬁcial was drop-
ped after several constitutional changes were made by the
group. '

“I proposed the referendum to educate students about
the issue." said Steve Landis. a member of Council's In-
ternal Affairs Committee. He added. “students often do
not vote in SA elections because they feel they have no say
in what goes on, however. this question gives them an op-
portunity to voice an opinion ori’ something they believe
in.'I

Landis said, "this referendum gives students the
chance to make a meaningful political statement while at
the same time voting for ‘Student Association
representatives."

The results of the referendum will be sent to New
York's Congressional delegation. its two Senators. and.
possibly. to the President, Landis said.

The nuclear freeze movement, Landis said. dates back
to 1979. when Randall Forsberg. in a speech in Louisville.
Kentucky, introduced the idea. in 1982 city and state elec-
tions across' the" country eleven and a half million
Americans, or 60 percent of those who voted, endorsed
nuclear freeze referendums, Landis added.

appropriated $373.53 from the Emergency Spending Line

to pay students to hand out tax stickers during
preregistration and registration for courses for next fall.

Last semester. a similar proposal was voted down by
Council. The tax stickers. afﬁxed to the back of SUNYA
ID cards, serve as proof that a student has paid the man-
datory student activity fee and entities students to dis-

-counts on parties. movies. and many other campus

events.

Central Council members handed out the stickers last
semester. This bill stipulates that Central Council
members may not be hired to hand out the stickers. It did
members of the SA executive
branch would not' be hired. however. many members said
they felt that was implied.

Students hired to pass out the stickers will be paid $3.35
an hour. the legal minimum wage. '

The bill. introduced by the Finance Committee of

University Cinemas

University Cinemas ofﬁcials will not pursue charges
against the group’s treasurer. Rich Kunen. in Supreme
Court.

Last week. the Cinema Executive Board had threatened
to resign if Kunen was not suspended for allegedly in-
terfering with the duties of other members.

Cinemas President Lisa Feerick said, “a meetng of our
executive board was held last Sunday in which we decided
to attempt to solve our problems within the group and
certain amendments to our Constitution were proposed
and ratiﬁed by the group."

The new amendments spell out what is considered im-
proper interference in the duties of other members. and
added a clause that allows managers to cancel a ﬁlm. An
impeachment clause was also written in.

Grounds for impeachment now include overstepping
responsibility without permission, violating the Univer-
sity's afﬁrmative action policy. or refusal to carry out the
duties of an ofﬁce.

Feerick also said that she will not sign an Affirmative
Action complaint against Kunen because “I am trying to
work the problem out with Kunen via personal com-
munication." She is looking and hoping for a positive
outlook for Cinemas for the rest of the semester and said
that the ﬁlms being planned for next semester could in-
clude Ghostbusters. '

Kunen also emphasized that the outlook for Cinemas is
very good. He said. “the situation has not been rectified
yet. but nothing that happened before will happen
again." .

According to Kunen, no one is leaving the group and
“we are going to work out the problems internally.” He
added. “I feel real bad that the situation 'got out of
hand." ' Ci

I {Personalize the University" was the theme Tuesday
night when : about l75 students. faculty and. ad-

“But the answer is no. because without history we
would be less than human. The ability to extend history
through epochs of time extends our lives and imagine-

the present." he continued.
