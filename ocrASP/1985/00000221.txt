Sarah, a sophomore at
SUNYA. is stopped by a security

guard as .she is leaving 

Chopper. The guard thinks Sarah

‘ has stolen an item from Price

Chopper and he calls the police.

The police. arrive and place Sarah

under arrest? ._ ‘ . >
True or False?

1 . I I lit e " ’
police never  
read Sarah the .
“Miranda” 

w a r n i n g s .

(“You have the  '
right to remain silent . . ."). her
arrest is invalid.

.2. if' the “Miranda” warnings
weren‘t read, any statements
made by Sarah to the police can‘t
be used against her in caurt.

3. If Sarah confesses to the
police, they will reward her by
making sure that she receives a
light penalty in court.

4. if Sarah did steal from Price ‘

Chopper. she should plead guilty
when she appears in court.

(For the answers to this quiz,
read on. or, look at the end of the
article if you can't wait.)

. Most students glancing at this
page are saying to themselves.

“I'll never be arrested, so why‘v
should i both‘er reading this arti- '

cle?” Each year more than 100
SUNYA students. such as Sarah.
are arrested. Few of these
students ever expected that they
would find themselves being
taken to a police station in hand-I
cuffs. Some would have benefit-
 from reading an' article such
asithis which offers some prac-

tical do's and don’t's about deal-_ _

ing with law enforcement ofﬁcers
in an arrest situation.

‘ Remember, a brief article is not
ansubstitute for the direct advice
of an attorney. Being arrested is a
s'erious‘matter and can result in a
criminal record, a jail sentence. a

fine, as well as other penalties,

Your first step if you are arrested,

or if you believe you are about to

be arrested. is to contact an

attorney. .

A common myth regarding ar-
rest procedure is that the police
must give the “Miranda” warn<
ings whenever. someone is ar-
rested. Many people believe that
if the "Miranda" warnings are
not given, the arrest is invalid.
This is not true. The'police are

only required to give these warn-ﬂ

ings if they wish to question ari ar-
rested person. The failure to pro-

vide the warnings only means that

any information obtained
through police interrdgation
would not be able to be used by
the prosecution at trial. The arrest
is not invalid.

if you volunteer in formation to
the police it can be used-against
you, regardless of whether the

’police gave the “Miranda” warn-

ings. Therefore. it is never a good
idea to provide any information
to the police except for your name
and address. Confessions are
among the principal tools of the
prosecution for obtaining convic-
tions. You have no obligation to
provide the police with this tool.“
and it is never to your beneﬁt to
do so.

Sometimes the police will try to
convince a person that the out-

come of the case will be better for ~

the person if he or shehconfesses

or provides information to the;

police. This is almost never true.

in any event, it is always better to‘
wait until you speak with an at-‘
torney before any decision is\

made about providing” the'police
with information.

The police might indicate that
they already have the information
they need and that they merely
want you to confirm what they
already know. This is a trick. If

they already had the information.

needed to convict you they
wouldn't need your confession.

Once again, you should not'pro- "

' warningsjmisleading A
"due to; several: common myths. ’

vide the police with the evidence
they “need ‘ to obtain your
conviction.

After you are arrested. you will
have to appearin front of a judge
for your “arraignment.” in the
City of Albany arraignments take
place every morning. in the
smaller towns around Albany ar-

raignments are generally” held ,
‘OnCe a week‘.

At the arraignment you are for-
mally informed by a judge of the
charges against you. The judge
will also inform you that you have
a right to have an attorney and
that the court will appoint an at-
torney for'you if you cannot af-
ford one.

Do not ever plead guilty at the

' arraignment. State that you want

an attorney. The case will then be
adjourned until a later date. If
you do not obtain an attorney
you will not be able to know the

, ramiﬁcations of a guilty plea and
'you will not be aware of other op-

tions which might be ayailable.
The recent experience of one
SUNYA student emphasizes this

‘ rule. This student assumed. incor-

rectly, that the charge against her
was not serious. She appeared at
her arraignment without an at-
torney, pled guilty to the charge,
received a criminal record and
was immediately sentenced to 30
days in jail. Had an attorney been
present, she would not have been
sent tojaii. nor would she have
received a criminal record.

One final caution. Do not at-

 tempt to escape from the police or

otherwise resist arrest. even if you
believe you are innocent. This
type of conduct will result in addi-
tional charges. _ ['3
