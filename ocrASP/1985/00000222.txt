mainder of this month and during April 21-24.

UC gets new policy

- ' (CPS) Under the new policy at the university of

California. firms interviewing on campus must
pledge not to discriminate against prospective
employees on the basis of their sexual
orientation. ‘

The Chancellors of all nine University of
California, campuses say they’re willing to con-
sider the proposal. based on a Berkeley policy ap-
proved in December.

Nearly 600 corporations recruiting on the
Berkeley campus pledged nondiscrimination in
hiring. ' .

'O’Leary will respond

President _0'Lear'y will' respond early next
week to a rc'éolution passed; y"Central Council

“integrity in the College Curriculum.” This

O‘Leary'sald it was. "a'goodireport and [that

Zahm also cautioned that five percent is not a
very large increase in sales. The increase may not
be significant, he said.

Pro-choice Lobby Day

On Tuesday. March 19. just less than 200 ac~
tivists from the New York State National Abor-
tion Rights Action League (NARAL) lobbied at
the Legislative Office Building. ‘

According to spokesperson Janine Suchin. the
goal of the pro-choice lobbyists was to ensure.
that New York State will continue to support
equal access to abortion. According to Suchin.
equal access means that women have realistic ac-
cess to abortions rather thanjust a theoretical
right to them. “The right to an abortion should
not be limited ﬁnancially. physically, or
geographically." she said. ’

Specifically. the 7th Annual Lob'by Day was to
ensure New York State’s commitment to
Medicaid funding for medicallyneccssary abor-
tions in the I985 budget. said Suchin. adding tha:
the lobbyists received a positive reception from ‘
many new legislators and anti-choice legislators. ’
