' ' “He didn't want to have sex

with me, he wanted to beat me
up.” said the voice on the TV
screen, which was providing the
only source of light in that Lee-
ture Center hall.

The 50 or so people in the room
were silent as the woman. and
others with similar stories, were
interviewed as part of an Up to
the Minute documentary on
Marital Rape.

According to the show, the
woman on the TV lived in 1

Philadelphia. and even though
her husband had raped her ll
times in less than a year, she could
not prosecute because Penn-
sylvania law treated women and
wives different at that time.

Today. Pennsylvania is one of
25 states that allow husbands to
be charged criminally for raping
theie wives. Laura X. the ex-
ecutive director and founder of
the National Clearinghouse on
Marital Rape, applauded this fact
during her presentation at
SUNYA Wednesday.

“Albany-isthe greatest city in» ' '

the world as far as I'm concern-

ed." X said, referring. to the ‘

December 20.- 1984 decisionby

the state courtlof Appeals in?

Albany. which overturned the

state ban on marital rape arses.

X. the name she' adbptéd to
demonstrate the anonymity of
women's history. 'discyised' the
Rideout case of 1978, which was
the first marital rape casein the
US. brought to court. Although
John Rideout was acquitted. X
said that the conviction rate in
cases of marital rape is between
80 and 90 percent nationally.
whereas it's only 2 to 5 percent in
other rape cases.

One problem that Greta
Rideout encountered was that no
one else thought marital _rnpe
could be a crime when she first
pressed charges; “If marital rape
is taken seriously, then at least the
women who are. able
to(suc). . .will: have the first step
conquered." she said.

X added that if marriage is seen
as a contract between the sexes. in
that women trade sexual favors
for security arid safekeeping, then

stressed the point that the doctors
on the staff Iare “com ent
physician's. n'ot‘magiciaris. ’-

“We'have lirititarions to what
we can diag‘r’tosevlfere." said Den-
nis. "We would like students to
fcel free to comi: back if they do
not feel better."

“That follow-tip visit means a
lot." said Brown; “the presump-
tion is that if‘a 'studcnl doesn't
come back. then whatever has
been done for them has worked."

The largest percentage of
respondents. 69 percent. said they
found the doctors to be infor-
mntivc. lint both Brown and Don-
nis see a communication problem
between the students and physi-
cians. “I don't know if students
ask enough questions of the doc-
tor when they really should," said
Dennis.

A majority of the respondents,
58 percent, felt that the prices for
prcscriptiom and the SLSO scr-
vicc charge were fair. Brown ex-
plained that the limit“ pharmacy is

stitution. “The whole notion that
prostitutes can’t be raped and
wives can’t be raped is really part
of the same intellectual base," she
said.  ~ 

Currently only three states do
not recognize any rights of wives
at all, X said. but- the other 24
allow for a husband to be charged
only if some form of divorce pro-
ceedings have‘been instituted.

The" most unfair laws in the
U.S., said X. exist in Vermont.
where a woman. if raped in bet-

have charges pressed, but the:
