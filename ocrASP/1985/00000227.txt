not be “feasible” to put the pro-
gram into effect in September of
1985 "because the program is
such a significant departure from
your present practice." and
because once approved by the
university it must be approved by
the Chancellor‘s office and the
State Education Department
which takes about four months.

Schal‘lcr, however is not
satisfied with this. “You tell me
how you‘re going to attract high
quality faculty to a program
that‘s been kicked around in the
dirt," he said, adding “students
will be cautious about getting into
this program."

“It's obvious the president
can't stand it, the vice president
can't stand it. the dean of the
school can’t stand it... the pro-
gram will not have any credibili-
ty." he asserted.

Questions were also raised as to
the legitimacy of the way in which
Business Education was treated in
the Senate.

According to Salkin it was not
made clear to the members of
EPC what had transpired at the
GAC meeting.

“One of our arguments is that
EPC was fed incorrect informa-
tion. We were told that GAC had
endorsed the report but that they
‘wanted to look into the quality
of the program‘." she said.

She explained that EPC then
referred the report to its long‘
range planning committee on
recommendation of Ramaley and

‘Chair Francine Frank. but she

was informed afterwards that the
report had in fact passed through.

GAC.

Ramaley responded by explain-
ing that there was some "confu-
sion because the chair of the
council (GAC) was not aware that
the quality section of the report
was being studied. - .

When he and the rest of the
committee approved the report
“someone just didn't tell Pro-
fessor Reeb that his own cur-
riculum committee was studying
the quality" of the report, she
said.

The Task Force was referred to
the Curriculum Committee of
GAC by Robert McFarland ofthe
Program Review Office in order
to assess the “academic sound-
ness of the proposed new
B.S./M.S. program." She added
that she hadn't “been able to
unravel" what exactly had hap-
pened but explained that it was
“not uncommon when you’re
dealing with a large group of
people."

Schaffer asserted. “i think it's
rather unfortunate that a coun-
cil's chair doesn’t know what's
going on."

EPC member Mike Miller
agreed. “The chair didn’t know
that something was referred to
one of his sub-committees, then
in other words, he didn‘t know
the University governance system
was bypassed which is exactly
what O’Leary says he refuses to
do."

In addition to GAC and EPC.
the Business Education report is
now going to be reviewed by the
Undergraduate Academic Coun-
cil (UAC) as well. According to
Ramaley. the reason for this is

because when the issue of
Business Education was first ad-
dressed, it was the graduate pro-
gram being examined. But. since
the report was compiled, shesaid.

'it was realized that “major revi-

sions had been made in the
undergraduate program” and it
was appropriately referred to
UAC. .

UAC chair Cathy LaSusa said
she didn‘t feel it was the “initial
plan to have it reveiwed by UAC"
but that “any curriculum changes
would have to be approved by
both UAC and GAC."

LaSusa also said she thought‘it

goals," she said. '

“The report was not an evalua-
tian of advisement at SUNYA to-
d..y." Reich explained. adding
that the committee “was not
formed as a response to a pro-
blem with advisement."

“CUE is doing a good job.”
Reich said, adding that “in
general. students must feel pretty
good about advisement.”

Hartman disagreed, saying
“The committee arose out of the
definite need for improvement. I,
don’t think they would have set
up this committee if advising was
good on campus.”

“Some people will say advising
is good or adequate. but it's
not," Miller ,said. “Obviously.
it's ‘a disaster. I get a lot of
grievances and complaints about
advising. l hear a lot of horror
stories," he explained.

“I don't think a lot of people
are satisfied with advising. A lot

 

was “unfortunatef' and “not a
wise'decision to send it (Business
Education) to long range plann-
ing" but added that it was "good
that there are people on the com-
mittee who support it.”

A major ’conccrn of Schaffer is
students who are currently enroll-
ed in the Business Education Pro-
gram and have applied for the
graduate program. He said they
have been “deceived”. by the
university in that they have ~made
living arrangements and turned
down other school offers.

“There are students whose lives

of students are disoriented by
their advisors. They’ll hear one
thing from one and another thing
from another," Hartman said.

“I think advisement on the pre-
sent level would get a C, and that
would be generous.” Hartman
said. “A lot of advisers don't
know what they’re talking
about," he said.

Hamilton said he was not able
to make an overall assessment of
advising since there are “hun-
dreds of faculty members who ad-
vise." He did add that “there is

 

    

are on hold right now. They’re
being jerked around left and right
and every week they hear a dif-
ferent story," added Miller. e

S .

At present. O’Leary and
Ramaley are “pursuing actively"
the, possibility .of allowing
graduating seniors to complete
their masters program while the
new program is being reviewed.
“We will know very shortly how
many students are. involved and‘
the possibility of opening ya
masters degree program next fall
for those students." said
O'Leary. D

room for improvement.”

Hamilton said that he will meet
with the committee again in “a
week or so” to begin discussing
how to implement the commit-
tee's suggestions..

Other improvements in the ad-
visement situation will be discuss-
ed. Hamilton said, includinga
computer system, called ADAPT,
designed to update students on
their academic requirements."
The committee report is only an
intermediate step in the improve-
ment process," he said. [I]

 ~ Bellow-defined

By RebeecaLulz- '

Saul Bellow has a fresh comedy in his works
which distinguishes him from other contemporary
American writers. said SUNYA English professor
Sarah Cohen, well-known for her eXpertise in'

Jewish humor.

Cohc'n, who spoke to an audience of 35 Bellow- .
enthusiasts Wednesday. is the auther of the Nobel .
Prize Winning Saul Bellow’s Enignmatic Laughter.

and Comic Relief..

Bellows “Chicago humor." as presented in. his
nOVels, shows “the diversity of Chicago as seen
through a Jewish immigran't’s perspective,” said
Coh'en. This is particularly true of Bellow's novel
The Adventures of Augie March, she added.

Chicago life. according to Bellow. was "crowded
with comic defamiliarizations of the familiar," said .'
Cohen. His characters had the ability to see every-
day life from a distinctively comic perspective. she

added.

needles and coat hangers.”
Reickert said. adding that “a
woman will do what she has to
do." The government must
"decide whether abortions will be
safe and legal or unsafe and il-
legal," she said.

Rcickert asserted “our enemy is
not the anit-choice movement.
The enen‘ry 'is within 'us. it is
apathy." ' .

According to Cohen, in Bellow's book Adven-

The three speakers also ad-
dressed th’e right~to-liie movie.
Silent Scream by Dr. Bernard
Nathanson. “The film was doc-
tored. At one point, the fetus is
shown at normal speed but during
the abortion. the speed is increas-
ed to present the appearance that
the baby is fighting for its life,"

said Steinbock.

During the discussion following
the presentations. the mostly-

 

‘by' his Comedy
lures of Angie March. this perspective is rooted in
the character's Jewish immigrant background.

"Augie is a' Jewish immigrant in Chicago
persecuted by. a Polish neighborhood. but who is
not particularly affected by the experience," said
. Cohen. “Augie backs the illusion's prerequisite to

the disillusionment. He accepts the conditions

within which we live, but makes a good deal mor
' of them," she added. .

Bellow's characters are a microcosm of Chicago
life. which is, in turn. a microcosm of American
life. according to Cohen;

Another of Bellow’s successful comic devices is
his use‘ of language. In Augie March, Augie's
“rustic English and use of Yiddish injectives pro-

. vides a slant on humor in the novel." said Cohen.

According to Cohen, Bellow's comedy lies in his
characters’ “vascillation between‘the elevated and
the elemental." Bellow‘s “would-be criminals are
unable to function in a gentile criminal world. Their
futility makes them comic." she said. ~J
