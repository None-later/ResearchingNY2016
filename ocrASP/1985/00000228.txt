in tournament action last weekend. RPi
captured its second straight ECAC title
with a 3-l win over Harvard and the Pro-
vidence Friars won the first-ever Hockey

East championship with a 2-1 double-r

overtime win against BC.

Providence goalie Chris Terrerl said his
habit of playing better when he faces more
shots enabled him to stymie the Eagles
with 65 saves.

“The more l‘m in a game. the better i
play. in games where we outshot the op-
ponents. we have a terrible record," Ter-
reri said in a jubilant locker room at the
Providence Civic Center Saturday night.
“Sometimes when you get in a groove. you
know where he is going to shoot before he
shoots." said Terreri. Against BC, “i felt
in a groove right from the start. i knew

after warmups it would be a good game." ’

His sensational performance probably
may rank as the best ever in Eastern
playoff hockey, perhaps eclipsing Ken
Dryden's 3-2 overtime victory when Cor-

 

 

nell beat Boston University in 1969.

Tim Army fed a pass from the corner
across the crease to Steve Rooney, whose
shot knicked goalie Scott Gordon’s pad
and went in the corner.

The game was 'a paragon of defensive
hockey; neither club had goal-hungry
players deep in the other team's end, and
seldom were men left unguarded.

Gordon was outstanding in the BC net,
but the quick forwards who supported him
with plenty of goals during the regular
season found it tough to maneuver against
tight-checking Providence.

Here's ‘to the new commis-
sioner. Finally, Willie Mays and
Mickey Mantle can be associated
with baseball again. i don't'know
about you, but when Bowie Kuhn
banned the two great ballplayers i-
forgot who they were. When i
thought of the name Willie Mays
l thought gambling right off the
bat. Now. thanks to our new
commissioner. i can once again
think of the- two best all around
players New York has ever seen as
baseball men. Thanks Pete.

Speaking of strike talks. i
wonder just how stupid the
owners think the players are. Do
they really think the players are
going to allow them to weasel out
of free agency beca'use of their -'t
supposed financial troubles? The; .
teams that lose money are set up"
to lose money as tart, shelters for
the rich old men that own them.
Every year the owners try again to .,-
chip away at the free agency
system, and until they stop there '
will always be strike threats.

. Finally. in case you’re '.in-
terested in hearing who is' going to
win each division race, playoff,
and the World Series, here it is.
The Orioles will win the AL East.
Sorry Yanks and Tigers. but
that's just how it is. The Royals
will stumble into the AL West ti-
tle but who really cares anyway.
The Padres and Braves will fight
it out tooth and nail in the NL
West. Either one could win it in
the last weekend, so i’ll go with
Sutter and the Braves. ‘Thc
Dodgers'wiil limp into third, but
noonecares about that either, ex-
cept for me. .

Everybody wants to hear about

the NL East so here goes. Yes
folks. the Mets will take the East.
Everybody on the Cubs had their
best year of all time last year and
that c'an't happen again. The
Mets won’t fold in September
again. and the National League
will start to catch up with Rick
Sutcliffe. The Braves will beat the
Mets in four games to face the
Orioles in the Series. The Orioles
will beat the Royals in three. ifthe
Royals don't give up after game
one. and then lose to theBrnvcs

‘84-‘85 grapplers take down previous records

By Cathy Errlg
muomt ASSISTANT

They may have been a point shy
of defeating top-ranked lthaca
College, suffered a disappointing
loss to Bin'ghamton and not lived
up to their expectations at the
NCAA's. Yet nothing can alter
the fact that the 1984-85 grapplers
of Albany State were the winn-
ingest Dane grapplers ever.

“We had a terriﬁc season, a'
great season." said “8 pounder
Shawn Sheldon. “We did better
than i had thought we would at
the beginning of the season. We
had a few close matches that
maybe we shouldn't have lost.
like Binghamton and Ithaca, but
overall we had a great season."

The grapplers 17-3 dual-meet
record tied them with the 1981-82
team for themost wins in a
season. and also equaled. the
1973-74 team's record for the
highest seasonal winning percen-
tage. The only teams to defeat the
Danes this season were ithaca

team. Binghamton. ranked se-
cond nationally, and Springfield.

dation and the NCAA title. made
up for the team’s disappoint-
ments to a great extent.

“On a team as tight as this
one." said heavyweight Gene
Faughnan, "where we‘re so close
and so together if one guy. and it
doesn't matter who it is. does
something it’s like the whole team
did it. So when Andy won the
NCAA's and then made it to Div.
1. it was like we all made it. And
when he lost. it was like we all lost
too."

Sheldon echoed this attitude.

“There was a great deal of
togetherness on this team; there
were no cliques and it didn't mat-
ter if you were a starter or not.
Even now that the season's over
we're still a tight group."

The collegiate season may be
over, but the competition con-
