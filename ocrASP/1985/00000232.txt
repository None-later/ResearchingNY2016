“(Then-Bermuda ‘

The stage is dark. A voice is reading
over a speaker system, and as he speaks,
the lights gradually come on.

 

Keren Schlomy

Voice: The year is 1992. Due to the
strict enforcement of the Grouper Law in
Albany, thousands of students living off
campus were left homeless. The State
University of New York, in its infinite

 

wisdom, decided to build another quad ‘

midway between the uptown and
downtown campuses. By 1987 it was
completed. It consisted of-four towers,
one in each corner of the quad, con-
nected by underground tunnels like the
islands of Bermuda are connected by
bridges. The towers were named Ber-
miedez (after Juan who first sighted the
islands in 1515), Somers (after George
who used food from the islands to end a
famine in Virgina in 1609), Tucker (after
Daniel: the first governor) and the Un-
named Tower in honor of the Bermudon
who, in 1775, snuck enough gunpowder
into America to enable George
Washington to force the English out of
‘Boston. All four towers are also can-

nected to theav’Tropic.Room'ivinJ-the .:

center of the quad where the cafeteria is.

In 1939 a strange thing happened. A
. helicopter was flying over the quad, and
when it got to a point roughly between
thefour towers - it disappeared and was
never heard of againi Thus started the
legend of... ’

The Bermuda Quadrangle
(Lights at half strength. Scene: a dorm
room- bed and desk seen. George plays
himself in 1989, -- he narrates the action to

i V the audience, but also steps in to participate

as he wishes.) . - .
George:(to -udience) Yeah, that’s how the
history books tell it, but i was there and
man, was it happeningl l'm George. and i
Was a student back then. One of the first to
move into the new quad. Let me tell you
how it was. i had a room on the 18th floor
of Somers tower. :.(lights go on all the way
and George steps into scene. Christine
comes bursting through the door.)
Chhristine: Hey George! Didja hear about
t e. . . . '
George: Helicopter? Everybody's heard
the friggin ‘copter story. It’s old hat. Tell
me somethin' new.

Christine: Jeezi Ya don't have to Snap at
me! i was goin’ ta ask if you heard about
the pigeon.

George: (narrates) Now l'd just come back
from a killer midterm in accounting and l
was‘in no mood to talk about pigeons.
Especially with some chick who'd been
after me all term. So excuse me if i sound a
little coarse. (To Christine) Cut the crap,
Chris, What pigeon? '

C: Three students said they saw a pigeon
disappear over the quad. They've been
watching ever since-

G: Yeah, i know.‘So what? Big fat hairy
deal. it's like UFO's and the National En-
quirer. Soon everyone'll be "seeing"
something disappear.

C: George, you have absolutely NO spirit
of adventure. (Christine starts to "flounce"
out of the room.) _

G:(Under his breath) -- Assholes...
C:(Turning around) What was that?
G:(Grinning pleasant/y) Nothing,
nothing...(Christine leaves and George
steps out to lac-narrator) Little did 1- know
how true my words would turn out to be!
(Not the assholes; i mean about the disap-
pearances.) Only it was real. Never again
was a bird seen in the sky above the quad.
it’s hard to explain. One minute they were
there. the next...weli. they just weren’t!
Planes avoided the towers like the plague. i
didn’t mind. Made it easier to watch TV
without the jet engines drownin' 'out "As
The World Turns.” And i,-- I didn't care
about a few lousy birds either. Once a
parachuter got blown off course. He would
have landed just about in the middle

. of...well, let’s just say he never made it all

the way down. After a few months. even
Ihc National Enquirer got spooked and
stopped sending reporters.

Then the next phase started. 1 was in my
room with Chris...(Ccorge walks luck into
the scene and lights dim slightly. As Chris
goes to room and sits on bed, George turns
to the audience to renmrkri No, i wasn’t
WITH her in the biblical sense. lCL'Z, some
people. We Were just BSing. (George sits at
desk chair) . .. ,

Christine: Did you notice how clean the

quad is lately?

George: Yeah, what of it? (aside to au-
dience“ really hadn't, but I wasn't about to
let her know that.

C: Well. it just seems that people are litter: '
. ing just as much as they used to but. . .

G: Yer tryin’ to say (in psucdo-dramatic
voice) Bermuda Quadrangle strikes againl
From plane cater to garbage cater.

(Christine giggles. Fret-xv action. George
g'ts up to address audience as lighls in
room get very dim.) i dunno The Quad
did seem kinda clcun. After that, the squir-
rcls and chipmunks. seemed to disappear
too. Along with them went the mice,
roaches, and other vurrnin ~ so no one com~
plained. in fact, Bermuda bur-unt- the most
popular quad to live on. Meanwhile, my
girlfriend Christine was really lrcakin’ out.
She rolled ovor one night ill'lt'f'Wt‘...Wl.‘ll,
anyway...(Gcorgc goes to bad dllrl sits
llt'iiltlc' Christine who is under the covers.)
C: (icorge, let‘s move.

G: What?!

cd.) Well. Chris and I moved off the next
week. i really gave it to her about the big
rush 'n all. but i moved - March it); I990.
On March l5 the FBI parked their cars and
walked onto a strangely silent campus. it
was a warmish spring day. The kind of day
lhat birds would be chirping at. if there
were any birds around to chirp,

outside in. -- told me i was lucky to be
