NYPlRG pushing‘item pricing

By Ilene Welnsteln.
("DITDRIAL i uilSl’ANT

The New York State Assembly passed a bill Mon-
day strengthening the state's “item pricing" law re-
quiring most supermarkets to place price labels on
all but 3 percent of non-sale items and the New
York Public interest Research Group (NYPlRG) is
seeking a sponsor for the bill in tht state Senate.

The current law. enacted in l976,' is .targeted at
supermarkets which gross more than $3 million in
one year. Unpackagcd bulk or fresh produce. milk.
eggs and items on sale for less than l4 days are ex-
empt from the law. but store's must keep on hand
lists of exempted item. and their ptices.

The bill. which was sponsored by’

Assemblymcmber Ralph Goldstein (D). has not
been introduced to the Senate’s Consumer Affairs
Comtnittee yet. Senator L. Paul Kohoe (R), the new
chair of the committee. has promised to review a
NYPlRG .eport on th bill. but will not comment
further. said Paul Herrick, Assistant Legislative
Director for NYPlRG. '

“The Senate is known for its anti-consumer posi-
tion." said Andrew Kantor. a member ofSUNYA's
NYPlRG.

NYPlRG member » conducted a two-day
statewide survey March ii and 12 of l.l23 con-
stuners at 67 supermarkets to determine the support
of the item pricing law.

The survey concluded that 93 percent of Albany
consumers favor placing price labels on all items,
while 90 percent of statewide consunters favored it.

Of the four Albany supermarkets surveyed. only
Price Chopper on Madison Avenue had a list of ex-
empt items and would produce it. Grand Union in
Stuyvesant Plaza and Price Chopper on Deleware
Ave. did not have any lists. while Shop Rite claimed
that they had a list but would not “produce it for
consumers or anybody,“ said Kantor, who helped

 

,t;.[. ‘s

Statewide. 50 out of 67 stores did not carry lists

of exempted items. Seven of those seventeen that. _

claimed to have lists refused to produce them. said
Kantor.

“76 percent of the shoppers surveryed would'be
willing to pay any extra cost" incurred from item-
prieing. said Kantor. adding that a “ballpark
figure" would be about 2 or 3 cents more per load
of groceries. The majority of people don't ihink
that the supermarkets would pass on any savings. if
items were not priced individually, to the consumer,
he added. ‘

Many stores have complained that the law is not
necessary because they would price items even if the
state did not require them to. According to Her-
rick, only nine states have an “item pricing" law
and the experience in the other states is contrary to
what New York supermarkets think. items are not
automatically priced by supermarkets, he said.

“The item pricing law helps consumers to com
parison shop," said Kantor. Stores don’t like item
pricing, because they say it's a waste of money. he
said.

Most supermarkets use a laser scan system at
their cash registers. but this does not help the shop-
per to compare prices, said Kantor. Laser scans
have been known to incorrectly price items also. he
said, adding that without price labels consumers
would not know when they were being overcharged.

According to Herrick, the Assembly bill provides
for several new revisions of the law. The law would
no longer be a “sunset law." but instead would be
permanent, he said. “Sunset laws" are set to expire

every fe\\ years, at which time they can be
reinstated, revised or allowed to lapse. The item
pricirig law. which was reinstated in 1979 and l98l,
is set to expire in December of this year.

The legislature “weakens the bill every time its
come up for reinstatement.” said Herrick, adding

Spurred by a NYPlRG survey indicating

7:30 pm. in LC 2i “to give people an ‘

understanding of what’s happening in

COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE Poor and
minority high school students do not
know about college financial aid. and
many are not enrolling in college as a
result, the authors of a recent study
conclude.

in a broad indictment of colleges, and
federal and state ﬁnacial aid officials,
authors of the National Student Aid
Coalition (NSAC) report say the current
system for disseminating financial aid
information is woefully inadequate.

“There are all kind of pieces missing
from a comprehensive information
system," said NSAC spokeswoman Lin-
da Berkshire.

The 37-page NSAC report. released
Feb. 25th, says the disadvantaged
students who need financial aid the most
don't have access to information about
aid programs because colleges do not
recruit inner city students.

Even more damning. the report says
available reference guides to aid fre-
quently are outdated. inaccurate or dif-
ﬁcult to understand.

The systems for telling students about
the oft-changing rules and funding
levels for many programs can’t keep up
with all the changes. the report says.

The report adds nontraditional
students are the largest growing compo-
nent of postsecondary enrollments. they
often do not realize their opportunities
for ﬁnancial aid. principally because
they are not in high schools where the
information is most available." the

Director of Affirmative Action and former
resident 0. Zimbabwe.

South Africa‘s apartheid policy is a
system of political. social, and economic
discrimination in which a minority of
whites rule the black majority. Approx-
imately 80 percent ‘of South Africa’s
population is presently denied m..uy
privileges such as the right to vote. the
right to buy and sell land and the right to

report warns.

The report faults the federal Depart-
ment of Education for concentrating on
telling students how not to get federal
aid.

"They put out posters saying things
like the best way not to get financial aid

“The current system

information is

is not to register for the draft and not
repay student loans." Berkshire said.

“The information they're putting out
is all negative."

States spend less than one-half of o'ne '
percent of the aid funds disseminating
information on what's available, the
report notes.

Leaders of NSAC's 37 member
organizations say they med new ways of
giving students the word.

Berkshire said that although the
report does not identify potential ways
to pay for such advertising. NSAC may
help organize a fund drive.

A master calendar to coordinate the
timing of financial aid programs. and a
guide geared to high school juniors and
sophomores also would help, the
report‘s authors said. E]

 

“Their lives." said‘ .laffe. “are being
totallyicontrolied'by the south African
government, which is determined to main-
tain its superiority and to preserve its
domination of the nation of South
Africa."

South Africa‘s apartheid policy is of im-
portance to students. he said. not only as a
major social .ssue, but because studtuts
are. in effect, paying to contribute to the
continuation of South Africa's
discriminatory policies.

“SUNY Central has holdings in cor-
porations that have investments in South
Africa. Turough a putsion fund they've
invested in corporations with operations
based in South Africa." said .iaffe. These
corporations employ members of South
Africa's labor force and therefore con~
tribute to intensifying the economic divi-

sion of South .\frica's peoyle. he added.

A film entitled “Last Grave at Dim-
baza,” depicting the relationship between
,blacks and whites in South Africa. will
also be shown at the forum.

Marisa DelMonaco. Co-chair of the
Feminist Alliance said she is “in ..upport
of getting apartheid out of South Africa,"
adding “Blacks in South Africa should
have self-determination."

Laurie B. Midgette of ASUBA (Albany
State University Black Alliance) stated that
members of ASUBA were planning to ut~

'tend the forum. Midgette said she feels

that “the system of apartheid in South
Africa is a disgrace.”

The topic of apartheid has been covered
closely in the media recently and according
to .iaffe i. what helped to prompt Tues-
day's event.

University Vawards‘5’5 faculty
members grants. for research

By Eric Hindin

IDITURIAI. .v‘ilSl'ANT ‘
The university has awarded

$126,474 to fifty-five faculty

members. as part of the Univer-

sity's Faculty Research Awards.

Program.

The money. awarded in .he
form of grants. wiil'be used
primarily for research by junior
faculty and by those in fields that
'traditionally do not attract ex-
treme funding. according to John
Shumaket, acting Vite-presidmt

. of SUNYA's Office for Research

and Educational Development.

“The faculty Awards Program
represents the University’s at-
tempt to invest in junior faculty
who need start-up support to
launch their research careers.” he
said. adding-the awards “reﬂect
'our conviction that as a research
institution we must support
scholars and artists in fields where
external funding m..y not be
available."

Potential applicants had to fill“

out a relatively brief application,
according to Myrna Friedlander
member of the School of Educa-
tion staff. descril ing the projtct.
presenting a method or rationale
and a budget. ‘

Friedlander. who received
$4.000. stated what she would use
$3.000 of her award as a stipend.
and the test for a drutoral L'un-
didate’s salary, travel. and other
expenses.

“The money will greatly
facilatate ~ my research.” said

Republicans chair Chris

“A lot of us agree with,
NYPlRG on their issues. but their
ways of funding are (an) in-
justice," L hristopher maintained.

“it is my belief as a Democrat.
that all Democrats. yea all
students ought to vote ‘no’ on
this item." Gelbman said. adding
that. “NYPlRG has refused to
commit any of lht..t’ resources to a
lobby against aid cuts." .

Hilbert said that group
members have been an active part
of the campus work against pro-
posed aid cuts, cosponsoring
teach-ins with Studtnt Achon
Committee. He added the group
is in the middle of a. "Higher
Education” petition drive.

Gelbman‘s use of the College
Young Democrats name has also
come under attack by the group‘s
members. Former President Patty
Salkin, currently SA's director of
student programming, said it was

improper, while other members
of the group said it was
“disgusting” and salt. they were
looking into the possibility of im-
peachment proceedings against

had in fact voted \ u a stand in .hc
