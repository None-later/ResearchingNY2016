“How many consumers are bung
ripped off during that 30-day

An important component of
friendship is the sharing of hap-
piness and good times as well as
the sharing of problems and con-
cerns. Often when one person in a
friendship is dealing with a pro-
blem, the other may want to help
but is not sure -

how to do so.
This article will

guidelines of a

helping relationship which you

may consider useful as you try to

help a friend with a problem.
Helping another person in-

fvolvcs listening. understanding,

and caring. Listening often seems
passive, yet it is the key to a help-
ing relationship. ' '
Listening means we focus our
attention on the thoughts, words,
and feelings of another person's
concerns from his or her point of

and that inﬂuence is not limited
to academic development.

Informal. out of class
student-faculty contact. said
the report, is positively related
to student growth also.

Graduating seniors report.
according to the study, that
they are satisﬁed with the ac-
cessibility of their instructors,
but more than one-half also
said they had no informal con-
tact to socialize with a faculty
member over their senior year.

Students also said that cat eer
preparation was an extremely
important goal of their
education.

This reflected a report from

' Newsweek — On Campus that
showed the biggest life-time
goal of incoming freshmen na-
tionwide was “being very well
off financially.”

Post-gradu ate evaluations of
Albany were extremely
favorable, sa.d Terenzitii.
Many of those polled said that

' the University's contribution to
their intellectual growth was
"large" or “very large." Seven
in ten reported that the Univer-
sity's ml. in their personal
growth was "large" or “very
large” also. _

Graduates also said that they
were very satisfied with the
quality of the instruction they
had received at SUNl A.
Moreover, 64 percent of those
going on to graduate or profes- -
sional school were continuing
their education at a school that
was their first choice.

Among those takng full-
time jobs immediately after
graduation. only 4i percent
rated their preparation as very
or extremely positive, however.

Nearly 55 percent of Bac-
calaureate degree reclpitnts v
take full-time jobs. with a me-
dian‘starting annual salary, in
I982 dollars. of $l4.750. Nine
out of ten are employed in New
York State also.

SUNYA “is a hell of a lot
better than we give it credit for.
(We have) a lot of reason for
pride." said Terenzini.

According to the report,
“though there is room for im-
provement. overall the
evidence paints a portrait of a
high quality public institution
doing a very good job of con-
tributing to the intellectual and
personal growth of its
students." 3

view. You can show a person that
you are actively listening by look-
ing directly at the person. by mak-
ing comments. and by summariz-
ing what the person has said.

Often we may feel as though we
should give advice or of fer' a solu-
tion, but most advice is ~ not
helpful especially if it is given
before the other person has had
the chance to express his or her
feelings. ,

it is also important to create an
atmosphere in which the other
person can honestly express his or
her feelings of sadness. frustra-
tion. or anger. Often our first
reaction to the discomfort of so-
meone we care abOut is to do or
say something that will make him

I or her feel better.

It is important to remember,
however, that the other person
needs to express these feelings and
have them accepted. You may
help the person to open up by

the first step in-"helping-“a'troubled friend

asking — “How did you feel
when such and such' happened?"
At times... sitting quietly \lllh
another person is all that is need-
ed. Your understanding and sup-
portive presence is often more im-
portant than words.

.Once the problem has been
identiﬁed and the other person
has expressed his or her feelings
concerning the problem, the next
step can be to discuss alternatives
and options. There are usually
many possible options available
in any problem situation.

For example. a person who is
having trouble in school has the
options of getting extra help,
developing new study habits,
changing majors. rearranging
schedules, or dropping out of
school. You can help a friend
evaluate the advantages and
disadvantages of each option by
being nonjudg‘emental. in this
way the decision will be that of

the other person and not one of
your own.

But what if your friend will not
take the initiative to resolve his or
her problem? In this case you pro-
bably need to suggest professional
counseling. You may also need to
consider whether you wish to con-
tinue in the helping role. It's im-
portant to realize that you have
limitations and cannot resolve
your friend's problem.

You might try saying, “We‘ve
been talking for quite awhile now
and nothing seems to be changing
for you. I know this has been a
difﬁcult time for you. but I’m at a
loss as to what to do. I care about
you. but I know that I cannot
help you."

We often hope that a friend will
fell better after she 0: he has talk-
ed with us, but this is not always
the case. This is especially true of
a personvwho is suffering from

the loss of a significant
relationship.

The transitional period in this
case 'usually lasts four to six weeks
and in the case of death, much
longer. in these cases we can give
support and understanding which
may help the other person to
establish new relationships.

Listening. encouraging the ex—
pression of feelings, deﬁning
alternatives or options 11le
developing a plan of action are
not alays necessary or required.
Often a friend may simply need
someone to listen to and unders-
tand their concerns.

ed about how to help a friend deal
with a problem, feel free to call
