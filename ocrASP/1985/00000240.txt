PSUC readies anti-apartheid pro

By David Wertheim
EDITORIAL .u ~$I5TANT

Plattsburgh State University College
(PSUC) will be the site of a demonstration
against apartheid in South Africa Friday.
The protest will be aimed at Marriot Cor-
poration, which runs the PSUC food ser-
vice and is a .nulti-miilion dollar inves.or
in South Africa.

According to Dwayne Sampson, Stu-
dent Association of State University co-
chair of PSUC's third world caucus.
SASU will be staging a sit-in at the main
cafeteria. Beginning at ll a.m., Simpson
said, “Students will sit in protest of Mar-
riot’s participation in apartheid."

Originally, the events of Friday were to
take place on Monday. March 25.
However, according to SASU’s Com-
munication Di.cctor Eveline MacDougttll,
the Plattsburgh students “just returned
from spring break. We need more time to
mobilize them."

Two Piattsburgh student organizations
will be helping SASU make arrangements,
said Sampson. Akiba and Apiebbo, l-VO
black student groups, are providing hous-
ing for the visiting SASU people. and
mobilizing student support.

A rally is also planned to accompany the
sit in. Tentative speakers include Bojana
Jordan, president of the American Sou.h-
African Peoples Friendship Associaiton
(ASAPFA). Michael Edwards Co-chair oi‘
SASU’s third world committee and Samp-
son will both address the rally.

“We are making a statement," said

' Sampson, “for education on the issue.» of

apartheid." "Students should not have to
support a corporation so heavily invested
in South Africa," he said.

The SUNY Plattsburgh administration
did not seem concerned with the upcoming
demonstration. In the public relations
department, no one admitted to having
heard of a rally and the college president

could not be reached.

A secretary at the Marriot food service
said, “We are not aware of this at all."
The director of the food service was not
available for comment, said the secretary.

0n the SASU side, the upcoming
demonstration is of considerable impor-
tance. “This is national action week
against apartheid," said Sampson, “there
are protests around the country taking
place."

SUNY Binghamton, another SUNY
school that uses Marriot food servive, is
tentatively planning a protest action, said
Sampson, adding that Plattsburgh State is
not as well organized against Marhot a. is
SUNY Binghamton. “Plattsburgh needs
SASU’s help more than does Bingham-
ton," said Sampson.

This is not the first time that SUNY
students and ASAPFA have worked
against SUN'I' connections with Sottth
Africa. Last October. the Student Associa-
tion of SUNY Buffalo removed $4 million
from its account with Marine Midland
Bank.

“We're interested in making this one of
our tip phorities this year," said SUN [A
Student Association president Rich Schaf-
fer in October.

in fact, Sampson and Jordan, who are
both involved with the Plattsburgh rally,

 

 

were both involved with bringing Marine
Midland's invLstments to light.

Jordan, in October, accused Marine
Midland of maintaining ties with South
Africa. ASAPFA created lists of banks, in

 
 

test Of Marriot

were criticized, and Jordan called Marine
Midland suspectf betause they had ‘ no
policy either for or against South Africa.”

SASU Vice president of Community
Colleges Andrew Chin mentioned Marriot
as one of the corporations that SUNY
should avoid. in October he said. "SUNY
Binghamton's SA passed resolutions in
favor of SUNY divestments and in con-
demnation of Marriot Hotel, which runs
the food service there."

He continued, “Main campuses. like
New Paitz and Oswego are aware. but
most (SUNY) campus“ aren’t really aware
of the issue of divestiture.”

“SASU is arranging for speakers like
Jordan and others to go to various
casmpuses to raise consciousness," Chin
had said in October. A El
