provided a chance for universi- ‘

ty students to publiclyI express
their talents. In addition. there
was professional entertain-
ntent. a t'i.rn festival and many
pics thrown at a variety of cam-
pus people. '

Dorf felt that the best stu—
dent performance was tlte
Kazoo brothers. “As a Kazoo
brother. how could I feel ..rty
differently?" he asked. joking-
ly. He said Ite was surprised at
the great variety and abun-
dance ofcampus talent and was
grateful for their enthusiasm
and interest.

Although the student tur-
nout was lower than last year.
bottt Dorf and Shapiro agreed
that the crowd was very
spirited. “The turnout was
smaller yet the. were very .-It-
thusiastic and had an ad-
mirable demeanor.“ noted
Shapiro.

Dorfadmitted, "I was a little
disappointed by the low atten-
dance. L .pccially since .lre
other events like Rock-n-Roll
Warfare. Afternoon at the
Bars. and the Dance Marathon
went so well. but the people
who were here were very
supportive.”

The beneficiaries of Telethon
were there on Friday night for
TV Hour, and again Saturday
morning between 10 and 12:30
for Children's Hour.

Larry r‘carson, director of
the Albany Boy’s Club on
Delaware Avenue. said “There
was a great feeling of cxcite~
rttettt among the children ——
especially front the break-
dancers who appeared on '1 I’”

Janice Parker., director of
Drakeland Day Care Center.
Arbor Hill's only licensed day
care center. agreed with Pear-
sort. "The children had such a
great- tir..c and V1o.cd .Ite
students so much. This 'was
clear whenthey sat with the
students instead of clinging to
their parents, who were seem-
ingly more excited than the
children." ‘

Both Pearson and Parker
plan to use their funds to pur~
cltase much needed equipment
and supplies. The Boy's Club is
irt vital need of physical educa~
tion eqrr.pment, co.nputtr's.
audio-visual materials and a
van. according to Pearson. He
added, “The only problem we

will have with deciding what to“

do with the money is producing
a just list of pr'rorities.”

Drakeland Day Care center.
which is a little more than a
year old. desperately needs sup-
plies ranging front crayons to
computers. according to
Parker. ‘ \Ve ltave Itindly ..rty
materials. only the pure basics.
We just can't run a day-care
center without something as
simple as construction paper,"
she added.

Dorf and Shapiro along \xith
the rest of the Telethon staff
chose the Boy's Club and the
Drakeland center from a list of
over 30 prospective
beneficiaries. According to
Dorf. the Boy's Clul. was an
overwhelming favorite and
choosing Drakeland was a “gut
decision."

Pearson said, "Since we serve
youth from a
backgrounds. I believe we are
unique."

Drakcland Day Care Center
serves clt.;drcn front 'low at-
come single-parent families in
the Arbor H111 area. said
Parker. adding. “We are com—
nttrnity based artd operate on a
sliding-fee scale serving the
poor. We pr0\.de more than

just babysitting, but also social.

and emotional development
which is vital to these
children."

The center cares for infants

'between L.ghl weeks ...rd tl..ee

years. which Parker feels are
harder to watch. “Many of the
teenage parents know so little
about child care and we fill the
gap." she said.

Both Pears. n and Par..er
said they wish to commend the

Telethon staff for their urttiring '

devotion and concern. Pearson
said. “Their task was not an
easy one and they performed it
with the utmost in protes-
sionalism." Parker said.
“What they did for these kids
was so meaningful, I just hope
they continue to think of
them."

This was the r.rst telethon .or

both Dorf and Shapiro.‘_

however they both plan to
come back next year and host
one hour of the marathon
event.

Shapiro said. “I had a great
time and half of me is sorry it‘s
over.” Dorf added. "1 would
like to wish next year‘s staff the
best of luck and 1 am looking
forward to hosting one hour of

next year’s TCIL.IIOII."”_ ;_ t. V   V.

SUBJECT: Off-Campus Housing and The Grouper Law

\

~\

It will so‘on be that time when students planning to live off campus will begin signing leases for the
1985-86 academic year. A. you COIhIdCT such housing, it is important to know that a “grouper law" ex-'
ists in the City‘ of Albany that limits the number of unrelated adults who may live in a single housing
unit. We have been informed that irt its enforcement efforts this coming academic year. the City will
move against land ords who ﬂagrantly violate that law, and against those landlords and tenants who are
the subject of legitimate neighborhood complaints. The City also has agreed to inform the Division of
Student Affairs whenever they plan to move against any property irt which students are tenants.

It is important for all students to understand and appreciate the importance of responsible citizen—
ship. .s'ttrdcnrs are encouraged to continue those positive activities. such as community clean-up days,
e t I I. . t u .
wltrch wrll Improve the relahpnsltrp between nergltborrttg property owners artd student tenants.
.

As you know. the University anticipates legislative approval of a 400-bed facility which should be -*
ready tor occupancy by .l'ttll 1987. Construction of this new facility wilt provide additional on-campus
space that will ease the City’s housing problem. In the meantime, we will have to depend upon sensitive
enforcement of the grouper law by the City. The UniVersity is also seeking to identify additidnal hous-
ing opporturtitics‘ for off-carttprrs students, In addition. there is a strong possibility that the Wellington
Ilotel will be available for the 1985-86 academic year. .‘Additiortal housing will also be, available at the '

Please consult with Ms. Kar'lccn Karlsott, DirectOr‘vof Off-Campus Housing. if you have specific
questions about rhe.gronpcr law or Its interpretation. She is located in Eastman Lounge of State Quad
