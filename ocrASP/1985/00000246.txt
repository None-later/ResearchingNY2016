Targeting Johns

_ “Johns is not usually thought of as a figurative artist. He
is probably more well-known for his 'numerological
figures' rather than human figures," stated Art History Pro-
fessor Roberta Bernstein in a slide talk entitled "Jasper
Johns: Body Fragments" given in the Humanities loung a
few weeks ago. The presentation was attended by an in
terested group of 30 people in Progress series sponsored
by the Center for Humanities.

Johns is best known for his paintings of American flags,
targets and overlapping letters and numerals Bernstein
focuses on Johns' use of casts of body parts in his work.
The casts appear in compartments built above the targets,
and in other works, an arm cast may be strangely juxtapos-
ed with numbers or abstract cross-hatching patterns.

Johns employs a variety of these body parts in his work
including eyeless faces, breasts. partial torsos, penises and
hands. The most commonly portrayed parts being disem-
bodied arms and legs. In his "Target With Four
Face5"(1955), four eyeless faces appear in separated com-
partments above a target. The bulls-eye substitutes for the
missing eyes which makes the veiwer feel uneasy and

vunerable. Another recurring theme is the presence of an
upside-down seated figure on the upper part of the canvas,
usually indicated by the chair and leg casts. The effect of
this is also unsettling to the viewer. Body parts are objec-
tified in a surrealist fashion. influenced by Magritte as well
as such Dada influences as Marcel Duchamp.

Johns makes life‘size casts of the parts, which are then
hung or placed on the canvas. "Johns himself
acknowledges the impossibility of eliminating the disturb-
ing effect of seeing the human body in fragments," accor-
ding to Professor Bernstein. He is obiectifying the parts
while using them for expression.

Professor Bernstein recently finished a book, which
came out last week, entitled, lasper Johns’ Paintings and
Sculptures I 954-1974: "The Changing Focus of the Eye”.
Additionally, she has had many articles pubished, one of
which is in this month's Arts Magazine on the artist
Marisol.
