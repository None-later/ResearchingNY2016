 ‘orpossibre evictions

By Matthew Gaven

Albany Mayor Thomas Whalen Jr.
warned SUNYA students that they may
face eviction if their landlord is in viola-
tion of the grouper law.

In it twice yearly press conference Tues-
day March 26. held as part» of the jour-
nalism 300 class. Whalen explained that
"absentee and unscrupulous landlords
that want to pack more than three students
into an apartment. run the risk of being
cited in city court and subject to ﬁnes.”

He also said that under the grouper law

“‘any students going into those buildings

are at risk."

The grouper law prohibits more than
three unrelated people from living under
the same roof within a house or an apart-
ment. If a relative is involved. the max-

imum amount of tenants allowed is four. ’

Whalen proposed that the. grouper— law
will force absentee landlords to comply
with the city ordinance and to maintain

.their buildings or to place them on .the

market for'saie.

According to Whalen. “President
O’Leary and I. along with Dr. Pogue.
calculated that there are probably 1,100
students in that area (the student ghetto). a
majority of which are from SUNYA, (and)
are in violation of the grouper law."

Whalen insisted that code inforcement
officers are not going to sweep the area
looking for violators. “We’re going to
start off in a very systematic fashion."

“When we get complaints from the little
old lady that lives next door who per-
sistently writes us about garbage laying
around, loud stereos and parties at all
hours of the night, then (we’ll) zero in on
those apartments and those students will
be in trouble." said Whalen. “Hopefully
the administration will have some sort of
emergency housing for them,” he added.

, Whalen said that students in violation of
the law Vwill be removed from their apart-
ments.‘ However. once they are evicted it
then becomes the problem of the Universi-
ty to find alternative housing. he said.

“I know that a lot of students don't
want to live on campus.” said Whalen.

" “The last thing we want to do is create

another student ghetto in the city of
Albany. It is unfair to the people who have
lived in these areas for 20. 30 and 40

 

“When we get
complaints from the
little; old lady that

_ lives next
door. . .Then we’ll .
zero in and those
students Will be in
trouble. ”»
—Mayor Thomas Whalen

 

 

years,"

Whalen said he felt that he won't suffe
in the next election as a result of negative
votes from students upset by his stand on
:he grouper law. _

“Why would students oppose me
because I want to uphold the law?” said
Whalen. “If avstudent votes against me for
a single issue like that. then he is a lousy
voter."

“If you’ve got four students living in a
four-bedroom apartment and they're good
neighbors... then we‘re not going to bother
them at all.” he said. “But we are going to
go after the group of students that raise

hell and create a nuisance, whether they're I

from Siena. SUNY or St. Rose.”

When asked how his office would res-
pond to the ruling in theLong island
township of Oyster Day that declared a
similar series of laws unconstitutional
under the New York State constitution,

.Whalen said'that he would contest the

decision in court.

Whalen addressed other issues in addi-
tion to the grouper law. including the
police department's relations with
minorities in the community and the
presence of the Guardian Angels in
Albany.

In regard to last summer’s incident of a
black Albany man who was, shot by a

police ofﬁcer, Whalen said “the Jesse
Davis tragedy was a symptom of a rather
deep underlying problem. The problem is

. the rather bad relationshipp between the

black community and the police
department."

Whalen expressed confidence in
Albany's new chief of police and said that
he will work closely with the minorities in
the community to eliminate the constant
friction between the two. '_

When asked why he resisted any help
from the Guardian Angels. Whalen said he
didn‘t think Albany had any problems that
would call for an outside organization to
be brought in. -

“I’ve resisted the Guardian Angels
because I'm very apprehensive about a
vigilante group and I don‘t see them as
anything else." said Whalen. “They have
taken it upon themselves to come into an
area and superimpose themselves on the
regular law enforcement mechanism."

According to Whalen the only people
who seem to want the Guardian Angels are
a group of “old ladies" who bombard his
office with letters complaining about the
Albany streets being unsafe for them to
walk on. Whalen said he feels that these
old women do not represent a majority of
the Albany population. El

Dr. Ruth brings sexuality out of the closet

By Doug Tuttle
STAFF WRITER

Sexuality came out of the closet and into
the Campus Center Ballroom March 26, as
sex therapistand media personality Dr.
Ruth Westheimer entertained and
educated an almost-full house.

Westheimer began by defending herself
against criticism that she is too explicit.
"In order to have a good discussion. I
believe we must speak in explicit ter-
minology." she said. .

Westheimer also explained that her open
discussion of sex should not be taken to
imply that everyone should engage in sex-
ual activity. “There are people who believe
that they should Wait to begin sexual ac-
tivity until they’ve married, and we should.
respect that.” she said, adding that “no

«one should be pressured into sexual

activity."

“Not for a munute, do I believe sex is
enough for a relationship." Westheimer
added. ,

“No one can do therapy on the radio or
on television, what i do is educate and give
some advice." said Westheimer. explain-
ing the intent of her programs and denying
that she attempts to give professional
treatment over the phone.

Westheimer said that “mostly young
people call" her radio program that, ac
cording to her is “In 40 different markets
and growing."

“Who but you young people would have
the patience to keep dialing?" Westheimer

sited.
“It’s not a program for children."

Westheimer said however. “but'at least the
information is correct." . I

The 4‘7" sex therapist expressed an
open view of sexual behavior. “Anything
two consenteing adults do in the privacy of
their bedroom. living room. kitchen floor.
is OK with me." she said.

Westheimer stressed the importance of
contraception. “I don't mind sounding
like‘a broken record." she said. “11‘ 1 pre-
vent onc unwanted pregnancy. I have done
my job."

“Most unwanted pregnancies are out of
ignorance." Westheimer continued.

“I don’t want people to use abortion as
a contraceptive. but abortion must be legal
for when there is a contraceptive failure."
said Westheimer. as many in the audience
applauded.

 

Westheimer had an opportunity to
receive an award as cable television's best
interviewer that same night. but chose to
come to SUNYA instead because she had
such a “fantastic good time here two years
ago," she said. .

Westheimer. who received $3.500 to

“speak, said her bu'sy schedule includes a
private practice. radio and television
shows. and a ﬁlm she is acting in. besides
lecturing once a week at colleges.

“1 love it," Westheimer said of the col-

’ lcge lecture circuit. “1 especially love it

because there used to be an attitude that

V students never listen to anyone over thirty

and you can see they listen to me — and
I'm way over thirty."
, According to Fanny Trataros, Speaker's

' Forum chair. approximately 400 people at-

tended the event, which was not a sell-out.
althongh Trataros considered the night a
success.

“Everyone there seemed to have a good
time." Trataros said. “She stayed a long
time after the show. Everyone had an op-
portunity to talk to her."

“It was very entertaining, she knows her
stuff very well.',' said Andy Fox. a first
year student. "By being explicit. site gets
her point across."

“I think something like this is a good ex-
perience for many people. because it gives
them the opportunity to ask questions peo-
ple want to know.” said junior Alony
Hananla. adding. “I loved it."

"She was excellent," added Lesla
Graham, a senior. “very educational.

‘ (and) she's charming." Ll

College officials

told to put off
initial plans for

New York, NY
(AP)A state Supreme Court Justice has
ordered Columbia Unviersity to tem-
porarily call off its plans to arrest
students in their second week of pro-
testing their school's investments in
South Africa.

Judge Bruce Wright signed a tem-
porary injunction late Wednesday in
favor of students who have staged a sit-
in and sung protest songs outside
'Hamiiton Hall. The order is effective
until Monday. when a hearing will be

eld to rule on the rights of students
barricading the building.

The students and several faculty
members have asked the university to
divest itself of at least $32 million of in-
vestments it has in 27 companies doing
business in South Africa, including such
multinationals as IBM. Up to now. the
school has refused to accede to the pro-
testors' demands.

As of Sept. 30. Columbia University
owned stock worth at least $6.5 million
in International Business Machines
Corp. Other $2 million-plus investments
included holdings in RCA Corp..
Chevron Corp. and American Express
Co.. according to the latest figures
released by the school.

Students say the school's investments.
which represent about nine percent of
Columbia‘s portfolio, are de facto sup-
port for South Africa’s policy of apar-
theid. or racism.

"Students and faculty members in
this case are not protesiing the war in
Vietnam or issues out of the hands of
‘ the local college trustees — they are pro-
testing the actions of the trustees that
are aiding and abetting the oppressive
regime in South Africa." said the
students’ attorney, Jack Lester.

Lawyer and graduate student Ran-
dolph Scott-McLaughlin told about 150
'students camped in sleeping bags and
wrapped in blankets on the steps of the
hall — dubbed Mandela Hall by pro-
testors for South African political
prisoner Nelson Mandela — that the
court had afﬁrmed their rights to free
expression.

“Columbia University has been
threatening us since Monday night with
police arrest. threatening us with brute
force. But they can't do it any more,"
Scott said. "The judge’s order barred
Columbia University from bringing
police on this campus."

Lester said the order “affirms your
First Amendment right to sit-in and be
here so long as you’re here peacefully.
orderly." Unviersity attorney Floyd
Abrams said the school could have call-
ed in police in the beginning. but was
reluctant to use force.

“Columbia had a bad experience in
1968 when it called the police. and it has
tried hard not to do that.” Abrams_said.
Columbia was trying to “walk the last
mile” to persuade students to clear the
building without having to call in police,.
Abrams said.

Wright's order asks only that the
students not disrupt. interfere, lock or
hinder any classes or administrators.

The sit-in. organized by the Coalition
for a Free South Africa. started a week
ago on the steps of Hamilton Hall. on
the 17th anniversary of the assassinas-
tion ofthe Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr.

Among the coalition’s early sup
porters was student Lorraine Harrison
who attends Columbia College.

ln...huve neither engaged in acts of
violence, prevented faculty from
holding classes. nor prohibited people
