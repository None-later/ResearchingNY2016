CUE advisor works on building body 

By Johanna Clancy
STAFF WRITER

The idea of helping students pick their
schedules and juggling courses all day may
leave some people feeling weak, but for
one Center for Undergraduate Education
(CUE) advisor, it's the light part of the

day.
Celeste Budd, the .
newest CUE staff Friday

member, is a champion
weighttrainer who has
been competing in body
building events for five
of the six years women have been allowed
to.

Budd also founded. in 1984, the
Women’s Organization for Weight train-
ing, (WOW).

Profile

Budd said she started to work out after
she received her master's degree from the
university. She found her once athletic
body, which she had developed through
running track as an undergraduate at Siena
College, had lost some shape, she said, and
so she began working out with Nautilus
machines. It was two years before she
dared to compete, but she ﬁnally entered
her first competition, the Can~Am
(Canada-American) Physique Competi-
tion, and placed second.

Since then Budd has completed and won
various places in different competitions. In
1982 she won the Belle Valle Cup in an
overall women's competition.

WOW is an informational group, Budd
.said. “We're there to exchange informa-

tion. to help each other," she explained.
She decided to initiate a support group for
women weighttrainers because no such
group previously existed. There is a Na-
tional Physique Committee, Budd said, ex-
plaining that one must join it in order to
participate in competitions, but it doesn’t
inform members about training nor does it
exchange any information. WOW
meetings are open to anyone interested in
training and the group welcomes novice
and experienced women, she added.

WOW is also interested in educating the
public about body building, she said.
“Through demonstrations and seminars
we want to play down the myth of being a
hulk," Budd explained.

WOW membersare currently writing a
grant proposal for Self magazine, she said,
which would allow for education and
demonstrations of body building, accor-
ding to Budd. WOW members are also
scheduled for a radio talk show and will be
assisting and competing in the Nor-
theastern Regionals this fall.

Body builders train in different ways,
Budd said. “1 train every other day for
about one to one and a half hours. One
day I’ll use the Nautilus, the work out
takes about 45 minutes. The second day
I’ll use free weights for about one and a
half hours. This way the muscles don't get
tired," she said.

“Some people do a six day workout.
Each day they’ll concentrate on a different
body part. One day the legs, back the next
and so on," she explained.

WOW organizes movement classes
through EBA on Lark Street. At least once
a semester. for about six weeks, Maude
Baum, Director of EBA. instructs in-
terested people in body movements, either

for competition or general movement.
Budd said. 1

Training for competition is a bit more
drastic than every day training, Budd ex-
plained. “You diet for a minimum of six
weeks. This diet includes the bare
minimum — 60 percent carbohydrates, 30
to 40 percent protein and, 10 to 20 percent
fats — every day you work out," she said.
This preparation will make the muscles
stand out and the body look "cut," she
added. . 

There are two classes of competition —
light, which is 114 pounds and under, and
heavy, which is over 114 pounds. Each
class has three rounds 'of competition,
after which each class' winner competes
for the overall prizes. Budd explained.

Round one is a mandatory round, Budd
said, where each Woman has, ﬁve man-
datory poses she must execute. Round two
is the symmetry round, she said, explain-
ing that the judges look to see if one leg or
arm is bigger than the other or if there are
any marks, such as tattoos or. color
differences.

Some women put .orange skint dye on
their skin, because the darker the skin is
the more the muscles stand out, and it
streaks, said Budd. ..

Round three allows for free posing
where each competitor designs a 90 second
routine, set to music, to perform, she said.
“The classes at EBA really helped a lot
with this part of the competition,” Budd
added. ‘ '

Budd said she is looking for WOW to
sponsor a competition one day. “I have
the whole thing worked out in my mind,
but competitions take a lot of money and
time to organize," she said.‘ '

For now she willncomp'ele‘herself 'and
this Saturday at Hudson Valley Communi-

ty College’s Gym at 11 a.m., she will again

By Matthew Gaven

'If you’re interested in opening,
a new bank account or
dissatisﬁed with your current
bank’s service, the New York
Public Interest Research Group‘s
(NYPIRG) recently released guide
to local banks may beable to help
you decide which batik is best for
you.

The pamphlet , entitled
“NYPlRG Guide to Albany
Banks l984-.85}"‘was designed to

inform studenis on what services'

aréit"biinks‘ofl'eii.‘ .
I-‘The information was gathered
through a survey sent to all the

area banks with a total Of 13 p'ar- '

ticlpants." according to Project-

Cooi‘dinator'fd'r NYPlkG, Efrem -
Kahn. “The survey was prompted '

by a'iealizatl’on that when a'stu-
dent comes to an area‘and wants

to open“ani~account ‘at a local

bank, he hits no guide as to what

as 1 do when i hear the helicopters
above,” said Carmichael. “I get a
knot in my stomatth..and I can‘t
help but keep-tearing." - '

Trailing the pack in front of
her, Carmichael began to get
overwhelmed by the w‘orstkind of
frustration .—-. the fruitration of
not knowing. ., "~

“You just don't know," Car-

each bank offers him."
Besides listing and explaining
the various types of checking and

savings accounts offered by the

banks, other services that are

. looked at include automatic teller

machines, credit cards and stu-

- dent loans.

“In some cases the information
the banks supplied us' with on the
survey differed from information

we gathered when we called the '

individual banks to do follow-

ups," said Kahn.‘ “Most of the;
' figures are accurate but some may

have to be slightly updated
because they were compiled at the
end of 1984."

‘The' statistics are presented

clearly in chart form and broken ~

downi'lnto‘ categories which in:
clude minimum balances 'for
checking ac'éounts.‘ penalties for
being' below ‘the‘ minimum
balance, stop payment charges.

"The banks are arranged in no
specific order on the chart," said
Kahn. “The guide is designed to
inform. We could have done in-
vestigations and rated the banks
but we felt that this was a less
beneﬁcial approach, so we decid-

'ed to proceed with the original in-

formation concept."

According to Kahn. most
students use Marine Midland or
Key'Bank simply because they

‘have‘ on-campus' 'facilitics.
’Although "they are convenient,

they are not always the best for
individual needs, he said.

“This guide will give students
the information they need to
chopsc the best place for their

be helpful for off-Campus

lesser known banks which are also

near Rensselaer Lakes.

he added.

Tom Dcvinc, a SUNYA
freshman said, “1 carried my ac-
count from my home branch in
Syracuse. 1 like Marine Midland
because it's convenient but 1 plan
on using the NYPIRG guide to
see if another bank might be more
beneficial." '

Barry Kozak. a SUNYA
sophomore, explained that he
openedhls bank account when he

came to SUNYA. “1 use Marine
Midland because i live on cam-
pus. Next semester 1 plan on mov-
ing off. The ﬁrst thing l'm going
to do is change my bank. The
bank guide has a lot of informa-
tion which will be a great help to
me in choosing a new bank."
