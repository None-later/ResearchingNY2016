Students.” rights a policyconcern
regardless cf sexual preferences

By Cris Mayo

You may have noticed a bit of '

discussion lately on the topic of
homophobia. You may even have
witnessed or experienced irr-
cidents that struck you as anti—
gay. Probably, like many people.
gay or straight. you brushed them
off as being u -
fair but part f
"life. Well. ail-
mittedly they

People
are increasingly  
:a poll of life

and undoubtedly unfair. They are
also expressly against University
'Policy.

Yes, that‘s right, SUNY
Albany is one’ of a growing
.number of institutions of higher
:leorning that has adopted a non
discrimination policy that in-
cludes a sexual or affectional
preference clause.

‘ Since there are many ways in
,which discrimination on the basis
of sexual or affection preference
can be manifested there are also
several means of resolving these
conflicts. For instance. imagine
that you are a young enthusiastic
gay man taking your first poetry
course. You noticed when you
registered that the course would
examine the effects of the per-
sonal lives of the poets on their
craft. You also noticed that Walt
Whitman, a gay poet you had
. long admired. was one of the sub-

' _jects of the class.

However, when the time comes
to discuss Whitman’s work no at-
tention at all is called ‘to his
ihomoscxuality. though you had
gone '6Ver the marital histories of
half a dozen other poets. Chances
lore if you were looking to learn
about Walt Whitman you would
feel disappointed. kept away
from your history and culture as a
gay person. A situation not unlike
that whichfaces people of color
and women in most segments of
academia.

In this case you do have means I

at your disposal to improve the'
situation. The first would be to
approach the professor in ques—
tion. if you feel comfortable. and
outline your concerns about how
the white-washing of Whitman's
life made you, as a gay person.
feel. You might also be inclined to
add that you are worried that
making your sexual preference
known to the professor also

makes you nervous about‘ your _

grade. ,

if that seems like one of those
"you’vegot to be kidding" sug-
gestionsI you also‘have the option
of discussing the situation with
Barbara Schoonmaker, Director
of Research and Educational
Development for the Division of
Student Affairs, 457‘4932. Her
ofﬁce handles all complaints by
students of discrimination on the
basis of sexual preference. Any
gay or lesbian student who feels
their accessibility to educational
opportunity has been impaired
may contact Schoonmaker to
work out a resolution.

The University policy is also
directed against homophobic ac-
tion, assault. or harassment. Let’s
say, for instance. you're a lesbian
and you've been living in the
dorms for two years without inci-
dent. No doubt you’ve heard of
other gays and lesbians being
harassed but so far no one's
bothered you. One day you find a
derogatory statement about your
sexual preference pinned to your
door. A little later you hear a cou-
ple of your f'loormotes outside
your door rather 'loudly
speculating on your sexual prac-
tices and suggesting what they’d
like to do to you. This is harass-'
ment. Not only does it create a
tense living situation. but it could
also escalate.

In this'case it would be wise to
approach your RA or RD if you
want to confront and resolve the
situation informally. if you feel
that is not the right solution you

can take your complaint to the
University Judicial System. The
hearing on the case can either be
held before a peer board or a
hearing officer.

Each of the hearing ofﬁcers
we've contacted on this matter
were very supportive of lesbian
and gay concerns and suggested
that the option for a hearing of-
ficer would be less public and
perhaps less traumatic.

While it is certainly apparent
that the staff and administrator
responsible for the enforcement
of the non-discrimination policy
are supportive and helpful. most
gay and lesbian students are reluc-
tant to make complaints. The
reasons for this are apparent —
making a complaint is a public
act. '

Many gays are rightfully reluc—
tant to be too open about their
sexuality and making themselves
even more of a target. A few have
mentioned discomfort at the
thought of having to lodge a
grievance at the same office that
their student records are kept.

Likewise. gay faculty members 7

are required to file their com-
plaints through the Personnel Of-
fice. While the Personnel Office
has made it clear it is against all
discrimination, reasons for
hesitancy remain.

it is unfortunate that many gay
and lesbian students are unaware
of‘ the University's policy and
even more unfortunate that more
students don‘t feel comfortable
enough to make use of the
grievance procedures. If you have
any ideas on how this accessibility

'could be improved. the Lesbian

and Gay Center at 457-80l5 or
GALA at 457-4078 would be
pleased to receive your input.
Thank you.

SUNYA goes for record

Five thousand SUNY Albany students will place
themselves in the record books April 20 by por-
ticipating in the world’s largest game of musical
chairs. The game. which is expected to take two
hours to complete. is part of “Guinness Book of
World Recurds Day.“ - '

“Ohio State currently holds the record for
musical chairs with 4,5l4 participants.” said lvan
Shore, 8 co~chair of the event. “The pre~
registration is going better than we thought. We are
now expecting 6,000 people."

The event is being co-sponsored by SA. UAS,
WPYX-FM and Miller Beer. The first 5,000 people
to register on the day of the event will receive a free
commemorative T-shirt and a free Pepsi pointer
cap. Door prizes will also be awarded throughottt
the day. Registration begins at 10:00 am. and the
events begin at noon.

Double minor rules revised

The double minor regulations at SUNY Albany.
have been revised so that any undergraduate stu-
dent may have one major and two discrete minors
listed on their transcripts. Previously. students in
combined major minor programs could only list
one discrete minor. .

Under the revised regulations the same course
may not be used to fulfill requirements in both
minors. Onc course may. however. fulfill a require-
ment In both the major and one of either of the
minors. '

If at major and two minors are listed on the
transcript. at least two different colleges or schools
within the university must be represented. No more
than two fibldsfcan be from .liiﬁaiﬁlilqtslluejc or

Students who have a double major may not have
a minor listed on their transcripts.

AIDS blood test licensed

The American Red Cross Blood Services Nor-

theastern New York Region has received a supply

of Abbot Laboratories HTLV-lll antibody test and
will begin testing all donated blood as soon as possi-
ble. according to Anthony F.H. Britten, M.D.I
Director of of the Northeastern New York Region
Blood Services.

The HTLV-lll antibody test was licensed by the
Food and Drug Administration on March 2, l985.
The blood center is required by the FDA to use the
test to identify and discard any blood which is
positive for the HTLV-lll anti-body.

The test shows that a person has been exposed to
the HTLV-lll virus and has reacted to it. it does
not mean that the person will develop AIDS.

The Red Cross excludes donors at risk for AIDS
and defers individuals with symptoms of early
AIDS and those exposed to persons with AIDS.

Profs request salary hike

Tire United Universities Professors Union is
negotiating for wage hikes for non-teachers and
faculty alike. according to Thursday‘s Albany
Times Union.

The Union. which represents 18.000 members on
If! campuses. is pushing for a raise In minimum
salary for senior, professors from $25.400 to
$40,000. They want the contract to be retroactive to
