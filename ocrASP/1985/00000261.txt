Friend:

One who can be depended on
and care when you are up and
down. Friendship is a mutual
relationship between friends.

Anything In moderation Is alright;
that ncludes dependence.
Dependence is security; knowing
someone will be there and care
in good and bad. While one can
be too dependent on another,

one cannot be too dependable.

By David Werthelm
EDITORIAL ASSITANT

The Albany State Ethiopian Jewry Fund
has raised $1,700 to help the nearly 12,000
Ethiopian J evis who have emigrated to
[steel to escape famine and assimilate into
lsracli society. .

Leaders of the fund drive presented a
check to Elaine Drooz Friedman, co-chair
for community relations of the Albany
Jewish Federation on Tuesday. According
to Friedman, the donated money will go
directly to absorption centers in iSrael,
through the United Jewish Appeal (UJA).

The money wast-raised on the Albany .

campus through door-to-door solicitation

.and tabling in the campus center. said
I Stuart israelowitz. who along with Karen
‘I Ci’cber is co-chair of the Ethiopian Jewry
‘1 Ednd. Licbcr said that the funds were

generated mostly at the end of February
and in early March.

“After winter break, we held an
emergency meeting on Dutch Quad to see
whatcould be done to help the refugees,"
said Licbcr. She added that thc‘fund is not
directly related to Students EOpposcd to
Poverty (STOP). 8 group that is raising
funds to combat starvation in Africa.

“The Ethiopian-Jews were starving,"
said Friedman, “and those who were able
to leave their villages went ‘to Sudan, on

' idot. The Ethiopian and Sudanese govern-

ments are basically anti-semitic, so Opera-
tion Moses was designed to'gct them from
the Sudan into lsracl."-

‘ “Administrative costs are not being con-
sidered," said Jay Kellman, an adviser
and supporter of the Ethiopian Jewry
Fund. “This money goes straight to the
absorption center for food. clothing, and
very important medical supplies."

Friedman added. “these refugees have
some diseases that we thought disappeared
centuries ago. They will be cured. and they
will bevabsorbed into society. They all are
working very hard on being absorbed."

The Ethiopian Jews have experienced
something close to culture shock, accor-
ding to Friedman. She said th:I these Jews
still adhered to customs from over 2,000
years ago. “They never heard of Chanuk-
kah. because that didn't happen until
about 80 A.D.," said Friedman. “They
also never walked up stairs before." she
added, because there are only ground level
huts in the Ethiopian villages.

“But they all walked up the stairs into
the airplane to go to lsracl, because they
knew that they were going to Jerusalem,"
she said. “Everywhere they went in Israel
they asked if it was Jerusalem. Jerusalem
has been in their thoughts and hearts for
over 2,000 years. They are amazing
people."

Kcllman said that he called the emergen-

FRIDA Y. APR IL 12. 1935 El ' ALBANY STUDENT PRESS ‘1' 3

cy meeting and planted seed money in
order to get the organization moving.
“Around to or 15 students worked very
hard for us." said Kcllman, “but really so
many people were generous and involved.
that i couldn’t count them all."
JSC-Hillcl also brought speaker Joan
Roth to campus in February on behalf of
the cause. Roth had been in Ethiopia
twice. and had seen the conditions that the
Jews were living under. '
Friedman said that there might be as
many as 10,000 Jews still remaining in
Ethiopia. “These are the very old. the very
sick who could not leave their villages and

unddrivedonates $1 ,700 to aid Ethiopian .1er5

Walk to Sudan." said Friedman.

“We all saw our responsibility,” said
Mitchell Shapiro, a student who worked as
a fundraiser for the Ethiopian Jewry
Fund.

"This was something that had to be
done. Something necessary. I'm glad we
did it." said Licbcr. israclowitz added.
“charity is a responsibility in Judaism. We
must take care of our fellow Jews.”

Friedman said. “the U..l.A. i's sincerely
grateful to the students for helping out so
generously. i personally feel moved and
thankful for the opportunity to save
lives." El
