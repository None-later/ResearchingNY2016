“we are also trying to suppress
any rumors that are circulating
and there are plenty of them."

The rumors that are circulating
include that Wilson was on her
way to Florida.’ Williams said,
“this is deﬁnitely not true because
her plane tickets were never
taken." r

“In addition to (the) univer-
sity's own efforts. we have twenty
detectives who are fully commit-
ted to running down every lead.
They are working directly with
the Department of Public Safety
at SUNYA, the Albany Police.
the StatePolice, Albany County
Sheriffs Department, and Colonic
Police Department." Williams
said.

The university is assisting the
police in every way possible. ac-
cording to Williams, from the
simplest things such as feeding the
investigators so they don't lose

lvaluable‘ time to assisting in a
" statewide search.

 “At this point we are as sure as

" we can be that Karen was not on
\ Campus when she was last'seen,
“' but still nothing like this has ever
happened before,” Williams said.
The Albany area and the

- SUNYA campus are both

in relatively. safe places, according
‘-. to O'Leary. “We have worked

, our hardest to reduce risk on cam-

f pus,” he said. “but a risk-free

{ campus is impossible."
According to Schaffer, “the

‘ “Buti'th‘ey needed someone who
was prepared to go into the wood-
. ed areas, and i had my boots on. i
‘- didn't feel great about getting out
there, but once you’re out there,
the keeping moving helpedme.”

Most of the students didn't"~

want to. nor expect to. find
Wilson during the search. They
were looking for that intangible

something. “I’d love to ﬁnd her ,_

unharmed.” said Rich 'Cantwell,
Wilson's R.A. on Colonial Quad.

position."

Council member Steve Landis

ed then they should raise all.»

Russo said, . “Council should!

because the job‘ description' was

students, are very apprehensive.
This is a major unresolved pro-
blem." 'The incident has also
sparked greater campus
awareness, he said.

The increase of participation in
.the Don't‘ Walk Alone (DWA)
escort service is a direct result of
this incident. According to Maria
Maglione, a captain of DWA,
“the major difference is that peo-
ple are now approaching the
escorts as opposed to just waiting
to be asked." There is a definite
change in the awareness level, she
added.

Williams refused to comment
on the chances of Wilson’s being
found and unharmed. “The most
we can do is hope for the best."
Pogue said. “that she is okay."

“At this point we are doing ab-
solutely everything in our power
to locate her. We are working
With her family, agenciesI and
sources. with the university
directly behind everything."
O’Leary said. “Locating Karen is
top priority."

As mentioned earlier. Wilson is
believed to have been last .seen
walking south on Fuller Road
toward Washington Avenue.
Anyone in the vicinity between
8:00 pm. and 8:30 p.ni. on the
night 'of her disappearance who
may have any information
(regardless of how insigniﬁcant)
~s urged to contact SUNYA
Public Safety Department at
457-7770 or New York State
Police Troop six at 783-3211. CI

“Just to find a ripped piece of
clothing so we know she was
there.» Anything..,anything."
Across from the university on
the" other side of Washington
Avenue, Shelly Busher came

to develop the’existing faculty.
The “Balanced Curriculum
Project” focused the study of
women at the introductory level
of college courses. This method
exposes a large number of diverse
students to the accomplishments
of women. Thus, not only self-
designatcd students in Women‘s
Studies majors will learn about
women's achievements, said
Spanier.

While the study of women af-
fects all departments. according
to Spanier, the number of
women's studies courses as well as
enrollment in these courses has in-
creased at many schools.
However, she stated, “you can-
not remain just in your
disciplinary boundries in order to
understand the importance of
women."

SUNYA currently has both a
minor and a major in Women’s
Studies. The major now must be
achieved through an inter-
disciplinary study.

Spanier said-she thinks, “the
Women's Studies program is
moving along nicely.” Next spr-
ing an internship in the ﬁeld will

be offered.

Vice President for Academic
Affairs Judith Ramaley sent out
letters to all the chairs of depart-
ments announcing the lecture and
encouraging faculty to attend.
"There's a lot of interesting in-
formation (on the topic)," she
said.

The speech was part of a series
“designed to bring a lot of dif’
ferent points of view to peoples'
attention," Ramaley added.

While offering to individually
consult with anyone who requests
her assistance. Spanier maintain-
ed that she intends lo work main-
ly within her department. She said

she has not worked here long
enough to analyze whether or not
Albany teaching needs develop-
ment in women's studies.

The integration of women's
studies is "a long and complex
process," Spanier said. adding
“this is going to be a long term
project if you want: to see
anything significant done." -

Another question raised is'that
of women‘s role models. Spanier
raid she believes that society
needs both scholars of women's

said.

In a separate action, Acting
Justice Burton Sherman ordered
lawyers on both sides to appear
Tuesday to present their cases on
the university’s request for a
preliminary injunction forbidding
students from continuing to bar-
ricade the building, oneof the
main student hubs on campus. E]
