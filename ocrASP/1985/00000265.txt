Great Danes split, doubleheader With Colonials

In terms of weather, the
Albany State baseball team saw
just about everything yesterday in
their six-hour doubleheader split
against Binghamton.

The two clubs first started the
marathon under cloudy skies,
which gave way to heavy April
showers. By the fourth inning. the
gray skies cleared and bright sun-
shine dried the sog

gy field for

   

game two. The final out of the
day, was made at 6:45, under a
chilling sun-down and with
darkness creeping in.

The Dane baseball team are
already used to the unpredictabili-
ty of the Albany spring weather.
What they're not used to, though,
is being in a playoff hunt, which
is where they find themselves
after sweeping three of their first
four SUNYAC conference games.

doubleheader against the Col-

themselves in first place in the
SUNYAC East, percentage points
ahead of Binghamton. Albany
took the opener 7-3, beforelosing
the nightcap, i0-3. .

“if we continue to play the way
we’ve been playing we're going to
make the playoffs, said Coach Ed
Zaioom, who can’t recall the last
time the Danes qualified for post-
season action. "Our schedule

works against us. We’re going to
be playing six conference games
in six days."

There are only three other
teams in the East conference,
Cortland. last year’s champion,
Oneonta and Binghamton. The
Danes swept Cortland in a
doubleheader last Saturday and
will play a pair against them
tomorrow. The only school in the
Division Albany hasn’t faced is
the winless Oneonta Red
Dragons.

“it‘s up for grabs," said
Binghamton coach Dan McCor-
mack, whose team split with Cor.
tland last week. “Not much
separates Cortland, Albany and
Binghamton. And you can’t look
past Oneonta."

in the first game yesterday, pit--

cher Warren Miller and ace
reliever John Kalinsky limited the
Colonials to five hits as the Danes
trimmed the Colonials. 7-3.
Miller pitched 5 1/3 before taking
himself out because of a sore
elbow. ln came Kalinsky, better

known by the nickname-

“Elway”, and Miller couldn’t
have been more pleased.

“it’s great when he comes in
for me," said Miller, who is now
2-0 in conference play. “i throw
fastballs and when he comes in, it

‘ keeps them off stride. He’s got 5

pitches and four of them are
curveballs." Needless to say,
Kalinsky came in and retired five
straight batters to preserve the 7-3
win.

“They both threw strikes,"
said Coach McCormack. “That
was the difference."

Albany broke to a 3-0 lead in

the third inning aided by two Col-
onial errors. But Binghamton pit-
cher Dan Taukem took matters in
his own hands in the fourth. He
slammed a Miller fastball just
beyond the left field fencef with

With a 7-2 loss to Cornell and the
Florida trip behind them, the Albany State
men's tennis team’s record now stands at
2-l with victories over Stetson and RH.

Tomorrow the team embarks on its
busiest week of the season. Starting with
Middlebury. then a tough match against
Concordia, the Danes will face the likes of
Siena. Union, Skidmore, Binghamton and
finish off at the University of Vermont all
within an eight day span.

The toughest competition within the
next few days will be against Concordia.
An NAM school, rather than NCAA.
Concordia has lots of foreign players on
scholarships.

“i find every season that once we get a
couple of matches under our belts then
every match after that we get stronger and
stronger," said team captain Jay
Eiscnberg. “The more close matches wc
win. the better we'll get. in the beginning
of the season nothing replaces tntttch
experience.”

On Wednesday. the Danes defeated
Ri’l, 0-], taking three singles mutchcs and
sweeping doubles. The line-up has changed
since the challenge matches held lust liri-
day in Fort Lauderdule. Dave Zoblcr now
plays at the number six singles spot and
liiscnhcrg has moved up a notch from
third to second singles.

Dave (irossman defeated itl’i’s Mark
Dutt 6.1. 6-3 at number one singles.

Grossman topped Dutt, 6-4, 6-2 in the fall.
Eisenberg won easily over second singles
player Jeff Ressin‘o-O. 6-0. At number ﬁve
singles. Mitch Gerber nipped Chuck
Maiden of RPI, 7-5, 6-4.

Losses were suffered by Tom Schmitz,
Mike Dermansky. and Dave Zobler. At
number three singles. Schmitz lost 4-6, 7-6,
6-1 to Jeff Snow. Dermansky. at fourth
singles. fell to John Valentini while Zobler
suffered a 6-2. 7-6 loss at the hands of
Tom Larken. I ~

Zobler was winning 5-2 in the second
set. but couldn't finish it out. “The guy
came back.” said Zobler. “When i
couldn’t put the guy away he got his con-
fidence back. i beat him last season. l lost
all the big points in the second set. i had
three set points, but before long l was in a
lie breaker. i wasn't ‘match tough‘."

Down in Florida. the Danes lost their
first match to Florida institute of
Technology. 7-2. The two victories were
turned in by Schmltz at number two and
Mark Sanders at number six singles.

"FIT was our first outdoor match. It
was something like their 40th," suid
Eiscnberg. “(liven another week we could
beat them.“

The [Juries bent Stetson 5-4 in a match
that counted towards their record.
Schmltz. Eiscnbcrg, Sanders and the
doubles learns of Elsenbcrg-Dcrmansky.
and Gerber-Sanders were victorious.

“The Dennansky-iiisenberg match was
a three set match, the last of the day which

clinched the victory for us," said Lewis.
“We eeked that one out." added
Eisenbcrg.

Against Cornell before the break, the
Danes suffered a 7-2 defeat, losing all
singles matches. winning just at second
and third doubles.

“They substituted and could have beat
us 9-0." said Lewis. "They have a really
good team. Cornell had a win over Penn
State, which is a very good eastern
power."

Tomorrow, the Danes face Middlebury
away, then Concordia at 1:00 pm. on

Sunday at home. On Monday, they. play at
Siena.

“Concordia is one of the toughest teams
on our schedule," said Eisenberg, "a win
against Middlebury will " really get us
pumped up against Concordia. Saturday’s
match is really important." .

Grossman is optimistic about the
season. “I think one or two matches isn't
going to decide a season especially when
the season is just getting under way. We're
looking forward to the season."

“i think we're gonna get better, we're
pretty far from our peak,” said Zobler.
