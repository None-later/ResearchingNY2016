"Christ and the Bomb" feature Christ rising
. into the lethal clouds. Beneath, we are left
' .‘to suffer. One can wonderif there will be

any place left for Christ to go, or wonder
~ in anything will;be left at all. Maybe just

the cockroaches“a'rrd the rats.

' 'Disfigurement. and/or mutations are
' another theme. "They're Juggling Our

Genes" (Dona. Ann McAdams) is a

' f photograph ofthree women juggling

before a nocl'e'arn'plant. "The Holy War
Head" (Robert Arnesonl is a war memorial
and play on words. Part of the long passage
. on the base "of this,scu|ptur,e describes the
I symptoms of radiation poisoning. which is
personified in the misshapen head, cracked
'7 and swollen with sores. Danita Celtner's
' “The Father'“ is a 'mixedunedia," pro-
toplasmic creature that is as spooky as
anything you could find in a good horror
film. There is a human form implied but
hidden in the strands of gelatinous-looking
goo hanging from it. Beside that is Lauie
Anderson's "Singing Brick" Which plays
haunting, electronically synthesized notes.
Anderson's music adds a chilling note to
the psychological intensity of the pieces.
Several pieces focus on the "bad guys"
involved, notably Ronald Reagan. In "The
Lord's Prayer," Hans Haacke has our so-
called deeply
"Lord, the l’ershings are launched! What
now?" One hopes this will not happen--

Lord could doif there was a maior scale
muclear attack. 'Ronald Reagan looks up
helplessly to the sky, waiting for an im-
possible answer. '

Peter Huttinger's “Doomsday Drawings"
incorporate i i frames set up in the con-
figuration of the cloud, makes analogies
between guns. bombs and the U5. dolar
among its images. Defense is a matter of
,. lots of money to the powers that be. Peter
Saul's _".'l'hree Mile lsland",isvlcss focussed
on who the “bad guys".actually are.-lt is
cartoon-like with bright day-glo colors and
a crew dazed, wicked and stupid
characters. almost reminiscent of the
masses in a Hieronymous Bosch painting.

serious, yet funny as it reminds me of the
Saturday Night Live skit of "the Pepsi Syn-
drome." where spilled Pepsi is capable of
setting off an explosion in a reactor. in‘
these exaggerated situations we must not
forget that there is no room for even the
smallest error in real lite.

Robert Longo's "Love Will Tear Us Up"
is a sensitive relief in «asl bron/e depicting
the intertwined bodies of the wit iims of a
'waru the innocent children seemingly
asleep. Perhaps Longo is implying that this
is a "nuclear family." Outside of this ex;
hibii, we would probably not perceive the
connotations implied in the sleeping
figures of this piece. Together. all the
pieces in this show work well together
making a statement that is not soon to be
forgotten.

The images in this exhibition are very
well executed by a diverse group of artists.
Sometimes the quality of the art is so good
that you temporarily forget the power of
the subject matter in the artist's talent. The
exhibition is worth a second look, "Disarm-
ing images: Art for Nuclear Disarmament"
will be on display through June 1 at the
