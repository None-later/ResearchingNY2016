Myrtle Beach, South

If you're coming from the north’
east or the Midwest, the drive to
Myrtle Beach is considerably
shorter than to Florida. And
once there. you’ll find the atmoa
sphere more relaxed than most
spring break havens; Activities
include: golf, tennis, water sports
and lots of nightlife. The old
south end is more traveled. but
has the cheapest rates. And since
Myrtle Beach is a little more out
of the beaten path. you can
expect your overall jerk count to
be lower.
