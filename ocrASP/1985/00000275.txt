Arts and Entertainment

The December issue on entertainment
reﬂects the general lack of exposure given to
books. ﬁlms and music made by women.
You will do your readers a Service if you

seek out and review the work of women.
FLORENCE FETTERER
Norfolk, Va.

What planet is your movie reviewer Bill
Barol from? His review of “2010" claims
that Hal‘s farewell song was “Bicycle Built
for Two" when I thought all intelligent life
in the universe knew it was "Daisy."

WILLIAM MOORE
Boston, Mass.

It‘s the same song. The title is “Daisy
Be 1"; the lyric gees: “Daisy. Daisy, Give me
your answer, da/I’m half crazy/All for the
love of you/It won ‘I be a stylish marriage/I
can 'I afford a carriage/But you '1] look sweet
on the scat/Ofa bicycle built for two. "

"Dune" was a reprehensible excuse for a
movie, rife with gore, sadism and violence.
Nothing is more repugnant than the notion
that violence is potentially redemptive of or
necessary to a movie.

FRANCESCA J. SIDOTI
Albany, N.Y.

Thank you for your article on Martin
Short. In comedy, timing is everything, and
Short‘s time has come.

Violent Novels

Your publication of Lee Goldberg's arti-
cle celebrating his success at writing violent
novels was ill considered, and his “amus-
ing" anecdote about the horror of a female
student who read his “pivotal rape scene"

was offensive. Rape is not funny.
LISA D. JACOBS
Chapel Hill, NC.

While Mr. Goldberg waits to write a
“novel about relationships and feelings," a
woman is sexually assaulted every few min-
utes. is there really “plenty of time"?

KATHERINE W. OXNARD 5

Goldberg appears to be ill. What a sad
commentary on education at UCLA.
