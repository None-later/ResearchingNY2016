When you write. you make a
sound in the reader's head. It can
be a dtill mumble— that's why so
much government prose makes you
sleepy—or it can be a joyful noise.
a sly whisper. a throb of passion.

Listen to a voice tretnbling in
a haunted room:

“And the silken. sad. uncertain
rustling ofeach purple curtain
thrilled me filled me with fan-
tastic terrors never felt before. . . "

That's Edgar Allan Poe, a
master. Few of us can make paper
speak as vividly as I’oe could. but
even beginners will write better
once they start listening to the
sound their writing makes.

One ofthe most important
tools for making paper speak in
your own voice is punctuation.

When speaking aloud. you
wunctuate constantly Awith
iody langtiage. Your listener
hears commas. dashes. ques—
tion marks. exclamation points.
quotation marks as you shout.
whisper. pause. wave your arms.
roll your eyes. wrinkle your brow.

In writing. punctuation plays

the role of body language. It helps
readers hear you the way you want
to be heard.
“Gee, Dad, have I got to learn
them rules?”

Don’t let the rules scare you. For
they aren't hard and fast. Think of
them as guidelines.

Am I saying. “Go ahead and
punctuate as you please"? Abso-
lutely not. Use your own common
sense. remembering that you can't
expect readers to Work to decipher
what you're trying to say.

There are two basic systems
of punctuation:

l. The loose or open system.
which tries to capture the way
body language punctuates talk.

2. The tight, Closed structural
system. which hews closely to the
sentences grammatical structure.

Most writers use a little of
both. In any case. we use much less
punctuation than they used 200 or
even 50 years ago. (Glance into
Edward Gibbon's “Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire." first pub—
lished in 1776. for an
example of the '
tight structural
system at its
most elegant.)

No matter
which

system you prefer. be warned:
punctuation marks cannot save
a sentence that is badly put
together. Ifyou have to struggle
over commas. semicolons and
dashes. you‘ve probably built a sen—
tence that's never going to fly, no
matter how you tinker with it.
Throw it away and build a new one
to a simpler design. The better
your sentence. the easier it is to
punctuate.

Choosing the right tool

There are 30 main punctuation
marks. btit you'll need fewer than a
dozen for most writing.

l can’t show you in this small
space how they all work. so I’ll
stick to the ten most important—
and even then can only bit high—
lights. For more details, check your
dictionary or a good grammar.

Comma [ . ]

This is the most widely used
mark ofall. It's also the toughest
and most controversial. I've seen
aging editors almost come to blows
over the comma. If you can handle
it without sweating, the others will
be easy. Here's my po icy:

1. Use a comma after a long
introductory phrase or clause: After
stealing the crown jewels from the
TTllllCT‘ of London. I went home for tea.

2. Ifthe introdqu

‘ tory material is
short, forget the
comma: After the
theft I went home
for tea.

3. But use it if
the sentence Would
be confusing witlv
out it. like this:
The day before I'd
robbed the Bank of
England.

4. Use a com—
ma to separate
elements in a
series: l robbed the

Denver Mint. the Bank of England,
the 'Ibwer of Londtm and my piggy bank.

Notice there is no comma
before and in the series. This is com-
mon style nowadays. but some pub‘
lishers use a comma there, too.

5. Use a comma to separate
independent clauses that are joined
by a conjunction like Mﬂ,_fg§
(1131191. or so: I shall return
the crown jewels, for they are too
heavy to wear:

6. Use a comma to set
off a mildly parenthetical
word grouping that isn’t
essential to the sen—
tence: Girls, who have
always interested me.
usually differ from boys.

Do not use com-
mas if the word
grouping is essential
to the sentence's
meaning: Girls who
interest me know how
to tango.

7. Use a comma in

to prepare for an expression need—
ing strong emphasis: I 'll marry you
— if you’ll rob Epkapi with me.

Parentheses help you pause
quietly to drop in some chatty
information not vital to your story:
Despite Betty's daring sfirit ( “I love
robbing your piggy ban ." she often
said), she was a terrible dancer

I"‘ v ,

"I’mtctiatu ipnts xv tngiuigeontllelrrintedpage.Showbewildermentu Ia

maybe, but the message is: “Stay on
your toes; it's coming at you."
Apostrophe [ ’ ]

The big headache is with pos—
sessive nouns. If the noun is sin—
gular. add ’5: I hated Betty's tango.

If the noun is plural, simply
add an apostrophe after the 5:
Those are the girls' coats.

The satne applies for singular
nouns ending in 5, like Dickens:
This is Dickens's best book.

And in plural: This is the
Dickenses' cottag’.

The possessive ronouns

hers and3 its have no
i apostrophe.
Ifyou write it's.
you are saying it is.
Keep cool
You know about
ending a sentence
with a period (.) or a
question mark (I). Do
it. Sure, you can also end
with an exclamation point

direct ‘55; Y) ‘. question mark. a whisper with parentheses. emphasis with an exclamation point" .
ader (ur "mum (I). but must you? Usually it

please handover the crown.

8. And between proper names
and titles: Montague Sneed, Director
of Scotland Yard. was assigned the case.

9. And to separate elements of
geographical address: Director Sneed
comes from Chicago, Illinois. and now
lives in London, England.

Generally speaking. use a com—
ma where you'd pause briefly in
speech. Fora long pause or comv
pletion of thought, use a period.

If you confuse the comma with
the period, you'll get a run-on sen—
tence: The Bank of England is located
in London, I rushed right over to rob it.

Semicolonl ; 

A more sophisticated mark
than the comma. the semicolon
separates two main clauses. but it
keeps those two thoughts more
tightly linked than a period can: I
steal crown jewels; she steals hearts.

Dashl —— ]and
Parentheses [ ( )7]

Warning! Use sparingly. The
dash SHOUTS. I’arenrheses whis’
wet. Shout too often. people stop
listening; whisper too much. peo—
ple become suspicious of you.

The dash creates a dramatic pause

Quotation marks [ “ ” ]

These tell the reader you're
reciting the exact words someone
said or wrote: Betty said. "I can't
tango." Or: “I can't tango." Betty stu'd.

Notice the comma comes
before the quote marks in the first
example, but comes inside them in
the second. Not logical? Never
mind. Do it that way anyhow.

Colon [ : ]

A colon is a tip—off to get ready
for what's next: a list. a long quota-
tion or an explanation. This article
is riddled with colons. "Ibo many,

just makes you sound breathless
and silly. Make your writing gener-
ate its own excitement. Filling the
paper with !!!! won’t make up for
what your writing has failed to do.
Too many exclamation points
make me think the writer is talking
about the panic in his own head.
Don't sound panicky. End with
a period. I am serious. A period.
Understand?
Well . . . sometimes a question
mark is okay.
