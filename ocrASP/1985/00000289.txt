"I work according to curios-
ity,“ says Elizabeth Tallent.
“Sometimes it's dull stuﬂ‘ that
interests me, like how a woman
washes her face." In her ﬁrst
novel, “Museum Pieces.“ Tal-
lent‘s curiosity is likea magnify-
ing glass sweeping over the de-
tritus of life: bubble gum in a
drinking fountain or a pile of
mouse droppings on a kitchen
counter. Such speciﬁcity is no
\vriterly exercise: in this book.
as the title suggests, minute
particulars are the bearers of
meaning.

"Museum Pieces“ is a group
portrait—it‘s not quite a “sto-
ry“——of Peter. an archeologist
at a Santa Fe museum, his es-
tranged wil‘e, Clarissa, their
daughter. Tara, and Peter's lov-
er. Mia. The characters share
Tallent‘s obsession with arti-
facts: the novel‘s unifying image
is the Indian potshcrds Peter
loves to catalog. They collect
talismans: a shell containing a
single marble, a bird‘s nest con-
tainng a pearl and a thitnble.
Mia‘s ex-husband writes poetry
about the landscape; Claris—
sa paints still lifes. Tara‘s
friend Natalie seems to believe
“in an original kingdom of
things perfectly suited to her,
but that kingdom was some-
how destroyed, its objects scat-
tered  Her wish for this
sweat shirt or that pair ofjcans
is a displacement of tier wish
that her divorced parents were
back together: Tallent‘s people
look to objects for a center
that can hold.

erator makes “a rumbling diges-
tive sound“; another tells about
a generator running “with a sort
ofmonotonous throbbing.“ Au-
thors talk like this; characters
shouldn't. And while Tallent‘s
focus on anomic, overeducated
types unifies the novel, her vi-
sion of Santa Fe seems blink-
ered. Except for a glimpse of a
farmer or truck driver, we see
mostly biochemists, linguists
and assistant art directors of
dance companies.

As disconcerting as the peo-
ple we don‘t see are the things
that don‘t happen. Mia is given
a peyote button and tucks it
into her jacket pocket: that‘s
the last we see of it. (“What

she actually does," Tallent ad- ,
mits, “is ﬂush it down the
toilet. Maybe that could have

been in the book.") Clarissa
uproots the stakes with which
Peter has marked the site ofthe
house where he plans to live
without her: we never ﬁnd out
how he reacts. Even the ques-
tion of whether or not he goes
back to Clarissa is left hanging.
But “Museum Pieces“ is less
concerned with how things
turn out than with how they
happen: design, not inatten-
tion, led Tallent to leave these
points unresolved. “That‘s a re-
ﬂection of the way I see things
in the world," she says.
Tallent, 30, majored in an-
thropology at Illinois State and
has lived in Santa Fe for 10
years with her husband, an in-
surance agent. Her short sto-
ries, collected in “In Constant
Flight“ {Knopf 1983), have ap—
peared in The New Yorker, Es-
quire and “Best American
Short Stories.“ They won her
the sort of small, discriminat-
ing readership that appreciates
Mary Robison or Jayne Aime
Phillips; “Museum Pieces“
should make her known to a
larger audience. Meanwhile,
she has temporarily returned to
shorter fiction. The most tax-
ing thing about writing a novel,
Tallent says, was to keep be-
lieving in her characters from
chapter to chapter—“though
that turned out to be the great
pleasure in doing it. I‘tn go—
ing to do it again and I think
that‘s why: you get to have the
people again.“

1985 Style

Fresh in from Nashville, the
singer and lead guitarist for
Jason and the Scorchers are sit-
ting in their record company’s
Manhattan ofﬁces trying to de-
scribe their ﬁery brand of
rock. “God only knows where
we ﬁt in,“ says guitarist Warner
Hodges, outﬁtted in a sleeveless
black leather vest, jeans, cow-
boy boots and spurs that truly
jingle-jangle-jingle. “We’re a
rock-and-roll band that ap-
proaches music from a country
perspective sometimes." And
sometimes a bluegrass perspec-
tive, and sometimes a folk per-
spective. This means that the
Scorchers have grown weary
of inﬂuence-peddling by in-
terviewers. “At least,“ sighs
cowboy-batted vocalist Jason
Ringenberg, “there‘s no coon-
try-punk talk now.“

Still, come to think of it,
country punk describes very
well the breadth of the music
made by Jason and the Scorch-
ers. This Nashville quartet can
be sentimental or nasty, and
sometimes it‘s both at the same
time. In their four years togeth-
er, they‘ve put out two El"s of
relentless rock-and-roll songs.
And the same can be found on
their ﬁrst full-length album.
“Lost and Found,“ which isjust
out. "Still Tied" could kick its
way onto any countrypolitan
radio station‘s play list with its
plaintivedescription ofthe farm
life and gently wailing pedal-
steel-guitar licks.

Rave-Up: At other times, the
Seorchers‘ intensity approaches
that of new-wave nihilism. The
rhythm section of bassist Jeﬂ‘
Johnson and drummer Perry
Baggs drive Hodges‘s buzz-saw
guitar into high gear on rave-
upslike“WhiteLics."Evcnbct—
ter is “Broken Whiskey Glass,“
where the two styles meet. Set-
ting offas a country—tinged bal-
lad about lost love—featuring
this epitaph: “Here lies Jason,
strangled by love that wouldn‘t
breathe“—the song kicks into a
nasty suarler: “Your bedroom
heroes fade away when the
morning rays shine down."
Jason and the Scorchers play
l'rom thc heart—and it hits you
right in the gut.
