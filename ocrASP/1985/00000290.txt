Smith and her children: A challenging lesson in juggling housework and homework

New Faces on Campus

Older students are a pragmatic and determined lot.

ltairdresser newly enrolled iit college.
Before too long. the ttneducated English
lass blossoms ittto a cantptts heroine. Unfor-
tunately, real life for adults starting or re-
entering college is rarely as blissful as that
screenplay. Matty passages are more like
that of Bill Stein, 37, who enrolled as an
engineering student at the University of
Pittsburgh three years ago after he lost his
job to a college graduate. The former power-
plant supervisor says he was repeatedly
cold-shouldered by classmates and profes-
sors and found friends only after he wangled
his way into a fraternity. “It‘s something I‘d
never do again.“ says Steitt of his period of
adjustment.
lint forall the roadblocks. older students
are now attending college itt greater num-
bers thatt ever before. According to the
latest census ﬁgures, 37 percettt of all col-
lege students are 25 or over (counting part-
timers), up frotu 28 pereettt in 1972. Some
are pragmatists like Stein. who was told
that he would be hired back if he had a
bachelor‘s degree. Others come for midlife
self-itnprovetncnt. “You take ttew direc-
tions when you get older." says Linda Tice.

Oklahoma State. Sotne are fulfilling their
own visions of the American Dream, like
Owen Malottey. a 33-year-old former stee-
plejack who‘s now completing his English
degree at the University of Massachusetts
itt Amherst. “I grew up blue collar," says
Muloney. “I wanted a new beginning, a
break from my old world.“ And some are

simply seeking knowledge, like 65-year-old
surgeon Adrian Neerken, who is studying
ltalian at the University ofMichigau so that
he can read Dante in the original.
Whatever their motivations, many adults
encounter similar problems itt academe.
The most frequent is the loss of a regular
income. Ann Prochilo, who quit work as a
natural-childbirth consultant in order to
study tuedical illustration at Indiana Uni-
versity. explains that for her, entering col-
lege “means poverty and waitressing in
sleazy bars instead ofrunning my own busi-
ness." Often. older students not only jug-

 

gle child care. homemaking and
homework, but must campaign
hard to maintain tlte backing of
their families. Donna Smith, 30,
whose then unemployed husband
and six children moved 75 miles to
Colorado Springs so that she
could attend Colorado College,
still must explain to her children
why their roots were transplanted.
“This education,“ she tells them,
“will help us in the long run. I’ll
get a good job, earn lots of money
and make up for all that you have
sacriﬁced.“

The conﬂicting pressures from
campus and home are often enor-
mous. At Colorado College, Smith
edits the school paper and has
racked up academic awards—but
sometimes feels as if she’s de-
veloping a split personality. “At
school,“ says the senior history
major, “I talk about philosophy,
Europe and ski trips. At home, I
still chat about ‘Sesame Street,‘ meat loaf
and bowling leagues." Bill Stein says that
getting noticed at all by fellow students is
quite a victory. “The [younger] guys are too
busy chasing skirts, and the girls are too
busy chasing the guys," complains the hus-
band and fatheroftwo. “That leaves meout.
Old, bald guysjust don't get [attention]."

Younger students sometimes resent the
academic fervor of their elders. “They can
dominate the classes and intimidate people
who are younger," says Greg Laake, 21, a
University of Houston senior accounting
student. “Many of them will take one
course, bust their tails and ruin the curve."
At times, older students also clash with
their professors. Allan Lichtman, a history
professor at Washington‘s American Uni-
versity. remembers when “I was talking
about the Great Depression attd a man in his
