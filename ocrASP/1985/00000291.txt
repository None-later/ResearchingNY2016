60s raised his hand and said, ‘Sonny, what
do you know about the Great Depression? I
was there'.” Nor are administrators always
sympathetic to pleas of special needs. When
Donna Smith complained to Colorado Col-
lege oﬁicials about the size of her ﬁnancial
grant, she says, she was dismissed as "a mad
housewife.”

There are signs, however, that the genera-
tion gap is closing. Last May, Smith’s class—
mates rallied to her ﬁnancial cause, mount-
ing a petition drive that won her an audience
with the college president—and a larger
scholarship. And although some of the
brothers at Pitt’s Phi Delta Theta originally
treated their 37-year-old rushee as if he were
an undercover narc, Bill Stein was ultimate-
ly voted the fratemity’s best new pledge. In
the classroom, meanwhile, many teachers
have come to admire the discipline of life-
tested students. Says Houston journalism
Prof. Ted Stanton, "Older students are
more serious and more dedicated."

ollege administrators are also be-
‘ ginning to exhibit more sensitivity

to the special problems that older
students face. At Colby, “nontraditional”
students are allowed to earn degrees at
their own pace and need not fulﬁll the
college’s senior-residency and phys.-ed. re-
quirements. Similar transition-easing pro-
grams are available at schools as disparate
as Stanford, Goucher, Smith and Texas
Woman‘s University. And to encourage a
measure of comradeship, older students
are beginning to band together themselves.
At UMass-Amherst, the 25 + Club, which
counts 140 members, holds regular discus-
sions and social events. Says senior botany
major and club founder Georgette Roberts,
“When I came here, I didn‘t know anyone.
And I was not about to hop off after class
with [young] undergrads." She formed the
club because “I wanted to let others know
that this campus is not made up exclusively

of people under 25.”

That lesson is one that most people on
most campuses can learn by just glancing
around the library or student union. Over

4 the next decade, college administrators ex-
t pect to see an even greater proportion of
‘ older students. By the l9905—when col-

leges will almost surely be competing over
dwindling numbers of young students—ex-
perts predict that half of the college popula-
tion will be 25 and older. At that point. a
school‘s treatment of mature students may
be less a matter of sensitivity than ofsurviv-
ul. “lfwe are to be successful in the future,“
acknowledges Colorado College admis-
sions director Richard Wood, “we must be
the best at recruiting and keeping the best
students of all ages.” Times may still be
trying for today's older students, but those
who follow can probably look forward to a
reception that‘s somewhat closer to Rita's
cinematic welcome.
