[started thinking about my life in terms of
history. What could I remember? I remem-
ber being 11‘ ve and watching Walter Cran kite
reeling off the casualty ﬁgures. I remember
watching the ﬁ Ims of Ihesoldt'ers in Vietnam.
I remember in ’72 when people were wearing
P0 W bracelets.

—Deborah Kalb, Harvard senior

any college students view the war
M inVietnamusthey viewthePunic
Wars—it happened a long time
ago. But an increasing number, like Deb-
orah Kalb. are eager to make the
connection. There are a variety of
reasons: older siblings and parents
who were involved in the war but
have rarely discussed it; alleged par-
allels between Indochina and current
developments in Central America;
awareness that so much of contempo-
rary culture is rooted in the tragedies
of the ’60s. As a result, college study
of the war is growing, with special
courses on Vietnam cropping up on
many campuses and more attention
paid to it in other classes. Perhaps
more than at any time in the past
decade, students want to know what
the furor was all about. "I think stu-
dents are beginning to realize that the
war is critical to understanding how
the [older] generation thinks about
international relations,“ says Prof.
Martin Sherwin of Tufts. “It’s as
if, without understanding the war,
they’re missing the central formative
experience of adults in America."
They are certainly missing the cen-
tral experience of most of the pro—
fessors who teach the subject to-
day. Having tried to close down the
universities l5 years ago to protest
the war. many professors are now
teaching about it in the same class-
rooms they once boycotted. And
their passions often show. History Prof.
Eleanor Zelliot and English Prof. Robert
Tisdale, who teach the two courses on
Vietnam at Carleton, both opposed the war.
“I‘ve tried to ensure that we show all sides,
but it would be unethical of me to hide my
feelings," says Tisdalc. chliot broke. down
in tears when she was describing for her
class what she called the “disgraceful”
American exit front Saigon 10 years ago.
“I think her emotions added a lot to the
class,“ says sophomore Richard Wilcox.
who took chliot‘s course last year. “She
dealt with it by being hottest and by telling
us very clearly what her feelings were."
The war evokes different feelings in Carle-
ton I’rof. Roy Groh, who worked in mili-
tary intelligence in Vietnam. When he
discusses the war in his interrurtionai-

34

relations class, he recalls the “alienation,
drift and burnout“ that he and others expe-
rienced when they came home.

Professors who teach the war often use,
as source material, Michael Herr’s “Dis-
patches." Phillip Caputo's “Rumor of
War," Frances Fitzgerald‘s “Fire in the
Lake" and the PBS documentary “Viet-
nam: A Television History." They also
encourage students to do independent re-
search by talking to veterans and refugees.
But despite the strong feelings of many
professors and the increasing interest of

Tufts ’.\- Sherwin: ‘The centmlformalive experience’

students, there are not a lot of courses
speciﬁcally on Vietnam. Stanford and the
University of California, Berkeley, for ex-
ample. have none. At the University ofTex-
as, which dropped its course on Vietnam
two years ago, political interest has shifted
to the issue of nuclear war. Harvard I’rof.
Stanley Hoffman, who teaches a course
called “War,” is not surprised at the relative
lack of special attention given to Vietnam.
“Courses have a way of following heari-
liues.“ he says. “There was enormous inter-
est when the war was going on. but after ‘75
it dropped considerably. After trauma, peo-
ple want to forget about it. After 12 or 15
years they start to study it again. We still
have a few more years to go."

While some courses do draw a big rc-
sponse—Shcrwin at Tufts had to limit en-

rollment to 33 after 75 students showed up

—students tend to be more curious than

committed. Harvard senior Hamilton Tang

says he tooka Vietnam course more “to till a

requirement than out of any kind of idealis-

tic interest. It was just another class." Texas

Tech history Prof. George Flynn finds that

students are interested in Vietnam “as long

as there is shooting and killing.” UT history

Prof. Thomas Philpott believes that the war

"offends" his students‘ sense of patriotism.

“Saying America got its ass kicked by a

bunch of [peasants] with pocket knives is

like saying UT's football team is chicken
shit," he explains.

Ironically, students at the U.S. Air

Force Academy in Colorado Springs may

be as open about the war as any.

They are required to deal with the

subject in the context of political sci-

ence, military history, military tac-

tics and a course on “Morality and

War." They may view portions of the

CBS News report on Vietnam, about

which Gen. William Westmoreland

sued, as evidence of inaccurate re-

porting and the pressures officers

may face. Yet they are also encour-

aged to look critically at military

management of the war and address

such issues as the use of body counts

as a measure of officer effectiveness.

Lt. Col. Harry Borowski, who teach-

es history at the academy, reports

that because of their ties to people

who served in Vietnam, a lot of ca-

dets come into the course believing

that the United States lost the war

unnecessarily. At the end. he says.

“they leave questioning all those pre-

conceived notions.“ I

ost courses that deal with
M Vietnam attempt to engage
studentsby relatingthewar
to domestic upheavals. Watergate
and current U.S. foreign policy in
Central America. But Prof. Hue-Tam
Ho Tat, one of the teachers of a Har-
vard seminar on the war, believes that
approach smacks of egocentrism. “Vietnam
was not a war that affected only [American]
elder brothers and parents," says Tai, who
left hernative Vietnam in 1966. “Itwasawar
fought on Vietnam soil with Vietnamese as
both actors and victims.“ She tries to convey
a personal dimension by telling students
how the war affected Vietnamese families,
but “this did not have the same emotional
impact as the American perspective," she
admits. As one Harvard student says, “In
time I believe Americans will probably see
Vietnam as our tragedy and forget about the
Vietnamese altogether. People in this gen-
eration want to know that they can geta good
job and drive a BMW. There's no place for
Vietnam."
