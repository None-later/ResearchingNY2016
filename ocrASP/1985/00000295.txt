“The University at Albany has long con-
fronted the issue of (what is) referred to as
a ‘misguided marketplace philosophy' in
which academic programs are shaped‘in
response to external demand." said
SUNYA President Vincent O‘Leary in
response to a Central Council resolution.
which asked O'Leary to comment on a
report by the Association of American
Colleges. The report. entitled "Integrity
in_the College Curriculum." said that pro-
fessors place a higher premium on research
and their own advancements than on
teaching. Italso said that relaxed entrance
requirements had contribtttcd “to the con-
fusions that beset" campuses.

Another criticism mentioned in the
report was that the “decline and devalua-
tion in college curriculums is everywhere."

"Students at Albany have chosen to at-
tend a ‘university’ instead of a ‘college'
which by definition means It has strong
graduate and research programs."
O'Leary explained. defending charges that
research is ’overemphasized at institutions
of higher education.

O‘Lcary added that in 'New York there
are “a number of colleges which do not
have [the] responsibility” of research.

“We also find ourselves in agreement

. . asthey criticize the unhappy disarray
of undergraduate curricula." said
O'Leary. “It is precisely because of this

'edueation requirement." he added.
“General Education reqttirements do in-
crease undergraduate diversity." said
Mitch Feig. chair of Central Council.
“However. the ‘W' which was passed by
the_ University Senate negates that by
pushing in the opposite direction." 
“In implementing our goal of better
undergraduate teaching. we have moved in
a number of directions." said 0'I.eary.
adding that “the system of excellence
awards has done much to reward goo
teachers." - :
“We have taken a number of steps to
improve student writing and academic ad-
visement." added O‘Leary. For example.

Empty stomachs bring 270
to a full hunger awareness

By Pam Schusterman-
STAFF WRITER

Almost 270 SUNYA students experienc~
ed a touch of what true hunger is. when
they participated in the thirty hour Crop
Fast. sponsored by People and Food. a
hunger awareness group that has existed
on campus for nine years.

The fast was staged with a dual purpose
in mind. to heighten awareness and to raise
money, and took place from 9 am. Friday
until 6 pm. Saturday. Students par-
ticipated to show their concern for both
world lutnger and the httngcr that exists
right here in Albany.

According to Mary Robinson. president
of People and Food. the problem of
hunger exists on a national. regional and
local level. and is growing in the Albany
area. “There is so much hunger in Albany.
more than most people realize - especially
with the cuts in welfare and aid." she said.

The Crop Fast. People and Food's main
project for the spring semester. will raise
close to $2.500 which will be donated to
hunger relief organizations. Acbordingto
Mike Butler. a People and Food communir
ty service volunteer. 75 percent of the
money collected will go to Church World
Services. a relief development group. The
other 25 percent will go to the Albany
Food Bank to replenish local food
puntrics. ' ’

Butler explained that the money was col-
lectcd through a sponsor system with the
fasting volunteers gathering their own
sponsors. “People were-really responsive

to us." hc'said. "Most everyone showed ‘

some'lntcrcst In our cause." .

, The fast. which lasted for thirty hours.
seemed to' provide an increased level of
awareness in many participants. V ‘

“’I‘Ite‘actual hunger set In late Friday"

night." according to‘Rohinson. “and by
middin on Saturday I had a headache. felt
rundown and I just couldn't think too
clearly." it made people "really think
about what it would he like to go through
this on a perpetual basis." she added.

"It really increases‘ your level of
awareness of hunger when you realize that
for people all over the world it Isn‘t Just an
optional activity and they can't go out for

a big dinner when it is over.“ said Butler.
He added that he realized that their group
could‘ not single-handcdly solve the pro-
blem. but at least they were not just sitting
by helplessly.

Together with the Fast. :1 five tttilc walk
and celebration involving the SUNYA
students from People and Food and
Cobleskill's students from “Students Op-
posed to Starvation." (505) was held.
SUNYA students met up with the
Coblcskill students. who had walked for
forty miles with the intent of increasing
Hunger awareness.

According to Trent Schriefcr. president
of SOS. the Coblcskill group funetons
totally on the awareness raising level. He
explained that they donate food but do no
fundraise. '

“The forty mile walk from Coblcskill to
Albany was designed with the sole intent
of raising awareness. if we reached two
people and made them more aware. then
we‘ve done a good job." he said.

According to Schiefer their group is
newly formed and shares many of the same

- goals as People and Food. “We both want
to do things through action and self help _

programs." he said.

Robinson agreed. saying she hoped to
form a coalition of hunger awareness
groups with other' groups. "On October

16. World Food Day. we are hoping to do "

something together with other schools." 2

she said. adding "a coalition would be

very effective." g

According to Butler. getting people’ln-
volved in the hitngcr issue is-not always an
easy task. He explained that hunger Is a

"trendy" issue. “It- follows a-eycllc’pat- .
tern. sometimes people are very interested -

and sometimes not."

"We‘want people to know there really Is '

a problem." said Robinson. “and then We
want them to take it fl step further and in-
tegrate this problem Into their lives." She
explained that only then will things be able
id really change.

"Our fundraising events are very wor-
thwltlle. but they are only a temporary
httndaid on the situation. our main pur-
pose is to make people realize the pro-
blem." Robinson said. ' . i i

wejust purchased and are now installing a
computer-assisted advisement system. he
added.
“Recent initiatives “to install a peer
review system for evaluation of teaching
._..supp|cments the already existing stu-

dent ratings of instruction." said O'Leary.
“Every tenure and promotion ease . . .
now requires very full documentation of
teacher effectiveness of faculty by both
colleagues and students." he added.

"Many students report that the teacher
evaluation forms are not comprehensive."
said Feig. “They're saying the forms are a
waste of time.”

“The University is not doing what he‘s
(O'Leary) saying. It's expanding and im-
proving the graduate program instead of
the undergraduate program. Research has
Itttrt the quality of education." asserted
l-‘eig.

“We must continue to improve and
strengthen the Albany program." said
()‘l.eary. "but we must also not fail to ap-
preciate' what has already been
accomplished."

“O‘l.eary is defending the direction he's
pushing the University in rather than ad-
dressing the. issues of the report." said
I~‘eig. He added that ideally he wanted
()‘l.cary to de-cmphasize graduate work in
favor of undergradttatc studies.
