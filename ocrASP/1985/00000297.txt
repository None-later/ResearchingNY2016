SUNYA's' New York‘ Public interest 'Research

According to Bob Jaffe. progect coordinator for
NYPIRG, about 95 percent of the 55 professors ap-
proached agreed to sign the letter and to have their
names appear in an ASP advertisement for
NYPIRG. The letter was intended to show that
“NYPIRG is an' important component of the
university atmosphere." said Jaffe. ’

While “we barely scratched the surface." in pro-
fessionai support said Jaffc, he added that this was
a “one-shot deal. ' l a I

SA microﬁlm plan scrapped

Student Association will not be placing their
records on 'microfilm. instead, according to SA's
Rita Levine. the files will be stored in the basement
of the university library. '

Levine. director of operations, said that the cost
of the storage will be zero. The cost of microfilm
alone would be three thousand dollars. Originally,
said Levine, SA had planned to organize their files
through microfilm, although no money was actual-
ly allocated.

Receipts. revenue. payroll vouchers, and other
records will be kept in boxes dated and numbered,
at the library. Levine said that after a certain
number of years, records may be legally destroyed.
She says that the library will perform this service
free of charge. '.

Conference celebrates humanities

“What profiteth the man if he
gains the whole world and loses
his soul?" asked Christ.

in a world frotn which we seem
to be gaining more and nlore
every day, the need to address
human issues becomes crucial.
“The Humanities in Society." a
two-day conference beginning to-
day. will nddress issues ranging
from our hidden moral education
to computers and the human
mind.

“We will be looking at possible
connections between these issues
and the problems and experiences
of ordinary life." explained Beryl
Lang, director of SUNYA's
Center for the Humanities, which
is sponsoring tile event. The new
Center was established in
November “to foster (inter-
disciplinary) conversation and

comtnon work in the
humanities," said Lang. pro-
fessor of philosophy and
‘ ’ ‘ studies.

 

“We’re trying to do things the
standard department couldn't or
wouldn't do." he said. Helen
Rigueiro Elam of the English
department is co-director of the
center.

Scholars from around the US.
and abroad will converge on the
university's Alumni House for
two days of lectures and discus-
sions on issues ranging from
education. law and philosophy to
literature and computers. All
events are free and open to the
public.

The first panel, “Values in the
University: the Possibility of
Moral Education." will begin
around 2:30 Tuesday afternoon.
“There are values being taught in
every class at the university

.wllhout the students or even the
faculty knowing what these values
arc.” Lang said. "What are these
values? Who chooses them?"
These art: fundamental issues. he
explained. which relate equally to

the hard sciences as well as the
humanities. _

The panel called “Computers
and Persons" will examine ethical
and human questions raised by
the spread of computers and their
rapidly advancing technology.
such as privacy and the mind. it
will be held Wednesday at 2 pm.

According to Lang, this discus-
sion will get down to the basic
question of“what does it mean to
be a human bcing?...lf we deﬁne
men and women as rational be-
ings," he warns. “then we may
have to include computers as be-
ing human." in this vein, “cont-
putcr optimists hold that com-
puters will bc superior to human
beings ~— cvcrythlng the human is
and more." Lang said.

The other panels ltre titled.
“History as Social Memory."
and “How (Not) to Use the
Humanities." Leon Bottstcin'.

STAFF warren '
{Although Students Against
Forced Funding (STAFF) is cur-
rently‘ concentrating its efforts in-
to opposing NYPIRG in this
week’s Student Association elec-
tion. STAFF chair'Craig Rucker
is a plaintiff in a suit that would
prohibit funding of any campus
group that e‘s'pouses political or
ideological views. ‘

‘ "The intent of this lawsuit is to

remove activism from this coam-

pus,"-« ‘said Karon McMahon,
chair' of NYPIRG's (New York
Public interest Research Group),
Board of Directors. “This would
clearly'have a chilling effect."

The lawsuit states that SUNY
as a wholewould be prohibited
from “this mandatory collection
of student activities fees for the
benefit of.'and their payment to,
NYPIRG or any other person.
firm. corporation or other legal
entity engaged in the advocacy of
political or ideological views."

A similar court case against
New Jersey PlRG was settled in "
favor of NJPiRG on Julie 20, ’
l984, with presiding Jildge
Stanic; Brotn'an deciding. “To
the extent there exists advocacy in\
some of PlRG’s projects. that
fact cnhancesvrather than detracts
from the. educational oppor-
tunities available through
PlRG." '

Following that decision, a com-

. “parable 'case. against Minnesota

PIRG was dismissed. The Mid-
Atlantic Legal Foundation. which
is representing Rucker and the.
other plaintiff; against NYPIRG,
is. appealing “the. NYPIRG
decision. ' '

NYPIRG vs. STAFF '

<Front Page

if NYPIRG did not have the
money from a mandatory fee,
said Korowitz, the group‘s fun-
ding would “go down from $2.6
million to $2.2 million. which
would be enough to run NYPlRG
stastewide.”

in his rebuttal. Glen Freyer
stasted that “NYPIRG does work
on political issues" but accused
STAFF of “making no distinc-
tion between partisan politics and
politics themselves.”

Freyer stasted that “NYPIRG's
political issncs are decided by
students" who are affected by
therse issues because they “don't
live in a vacuum.” ‘

Frcyer also quoted Ruckcr ,as
saying, “NYPIRG is currently the
only political group on campus"
anti stressed the word “current-
iy" as an indication that STAFF
will go after SASU and other
organizations" next.

Wilson search

<Front Page

Another reason Cantweli said.
was that tile administration was
afraid that students would use the
time off inappropriately rather
than to parllcipate in (In: search.

Doug Lankles. a friend of
Wilson's. said “a lot of us feel
that she's not around the area."
He added, “Those of us who
ltncw her well bcilcve she's still
alive because we know how clever
she is and what she would do to
stay alive."

Ltlnkics also said he thought
that another student search would
not be that beneﬁcial because
area searches have already been
extensive.

Wilson is believed to have been

According to McMahon. "Any
group that works on political
issues will no longer be eligible for
funding." She said that Student
Association(SA), Student
Association of the State Universi-
ty (SASU), Student Action, Peace
Project, Fuerza Latina. Albany
State- University’ Black Alliance
(ASL’BA). Gay and‘ Lesbian_
Alliance (GALA) and the
Feminist Alliance would be
among the many'groups affected.
as well as NYPIRG.

“Anyone who is part of any
student organization has got to
feel threatened by this."
McMahon said. ' .

Although he admits being a
plaintiff in the suit, Rucker denies
opposing any groups besides
NYPIRG.- “‘.Ve resent tile fact

' that NYPIRG has misstated that

we’re against SASU and the ac-
tivity fee," Ruckcr said. “We are
supportive of both."

The court case is without nterit,
McMahon sad, because,
"Something couldbe political to
one person and not‘to another."

“Who’s going to determine ‘

'what’s a political act?" ’
McMahon asked. ffAre we going
tlo have a luwsuit’evcryume an

\organization does something?"

"That’s why the decision what
should be funded on campus
should be left to the school and
the students." McMahon
concluded,

“What it's saying is that
students should not be allowed to
have opinions.'\‘ she. added.

“l'm not advocating an over-

throw of the student govern-M

ment,f‘” Ruckcr ex'piained. “lint
just against them allocating funds

When asked by an audience
member why NYPIRG could not
operate without the fee. NYPIRG
member Joe Sammons said that

“if students don’t support us. we ‘
don't dare work on their issues“ .

and saw the few who don‘t sup-
port NYPIRG as an example of
th )se ruled by the maj lrity.

STAFF member Andy
Gclbman stated that “each stu-
dent should have the option to
join or not to join" and reminded
that “refundable funding is not

When NYPIRG members rcfer-

opportunity to accuse news editor
