some point you have to say that
you’re not going to be stopped by
it. It’s a war and you can't let
them win. Otherwise you'd just
hate to stay indoors. ”

This is the'tes‘timony of a rape
victim taken from Against Our
Will by Susan Brownmiller.

Rape comes from the Latin
word “rapere” meaning to seize,
steal, or carry away. Originally,
rape Was believed to a crime
against the husband or father of
the victim. Rape has a long
history, most prevalent in the
mass rapes of invading armies,
when the conquerors would take
over the property(women) of the
defeated. Today. there is a much
greater focus on the victims of
rape.

Contemporary rape laws con-
tain three key elements. First is
the use or threat of force. Second,
is the lack of consent of the victim
and thirdnis the, proof of penetraf .

crime against thevictim. Rapists
are men (Albany County Rape
Crisis center reported that no;
women were accused of rape in
I984) and victims are usually
women.‘There.is, however, a ris-
ing number of; men and children
reporting rape.

According to the FBI’s uniform
crime report, “Rape is'the fastest
growing and least reported violent .
crime in America." TheAIbany
County Rape; Crisis Center
reported 423 victim calls in 1984,

up from the 288 victim calls in
I983. Rape. unlike other violent
crime. is clouded with many
myths about the victim, the rapist
and the crime. '

' Myth: Rape is “an act of'

passion.
Fact: Rape is a crime of
» violence. 87 percent of rapes in-
volved a weapon or a threat Of
violence. 71 percent of rapes are
premeditated. As for uncon-
trollable lust, the ages of the vic-
tims range from 2 months to 97
years.

Myth: Rapes take place in a dark
alley by a deranged stranger.
Fact: 35 percent of tapes take
place in the victim's home. In 48
percent of cases, the victim and
rapist are known to each other;

Myth: No woman can be taped
against her will.

Fact: Fear. threats and
weaponscan overwhelm a victim.
The average rapist is 3 inches
taller and 24 pounds heavier than

his victim. Also, 50 .percent of .

rapes are gang rapes, putting the
victim in a much more dangerous
situation.

Myth: 'Women want to be
raped.

Fact: No. This myth is extreme-
ly harmful'for the victim. Police.
courts, family and friends (having
been raised in a society that
presents this myth) may doubt the
victim’s word. Support systems
might actually blame the victim,
rather than providing, needed

,support. ' «t , \1 l ' 4

Myth: Women make up storie
about rape to be vindictive.

‘ Fact: As in all‘other fe‘lonies,
only‘2 percent of all rape charges
are unfounded. - '

Myth: Rapists are crazy and

deranged.
Fact: Studies of rapists have
shown them to, be fairly average

with 'a'few common'

characteristics:"low self esteem,
tendency .toward violence,
negative attitudes toWard women,
a’nd‘a desire to degrade and

area is working ‘hard to combat
rape. There is" a special sex of-

Center. -

It should‘be stressed here that "

Katharine Gibbs ENTREE—

Ihe Xvicn'n't wishes tailor, so.
Medication attention should ‘be,
so'ught immediately. Someone
from the Rape Crisis Center will-
go with you to the hospital
(within 72 hours of the attack)
and also offer legal advice and
support.

If you are the victim of a sexual
assualt:
I) Go to a safe place and call so-
meone you trust. '
2) Do not bathe, wash, or
douche. '
3) Call the Albany County Rape
Crisis Center of the police.
4) Go to the hospital as soon as

possible for treatment of injut'es .

and possible prevention of VD
and pregnancy. Also evidence can
be collected if you should decide
to prosecute. ‘

Because of the devastating
nature of this crime. Rape Crisis
also offers counseling for the
friends and families of rape vic-
tims as well. '

It is a good idea to learn to take
precautions. Rather than creating
a sense of paranoia, precautions
.can make you more confident and
comfortable; .Visit the Rape Crisis
Center, take a self defense course,
and mostly. trust your intuition
about a potentially dangerous
situation.

Within the past year on the SUNYA campus;

“SA thought it would be a good idea to form this

group," said ..Salkin. “We helped everyone get

added that the Greek Council is not run by SA.

“We’re going to govern the fraternities," said '

example. we're setting up rush week so all frater-

recognized at this point. According to Abelow, a
constitution will be drawn up before next semester,
so as to allow for recognition.

Each fraternlty and sorority is SA recognized,
but funded with member's dues and through fun-
draising. There are social. business and service
fraternltltes and sororities on campus.

“A few years ago, there were some bad ex;
perlcnces with hazing and other problems with frats
at SUNYA," said Abelow. "We're back on a trial
basis n'ow. Fraternities really push school spirit. so
I'm sure our stay will be long," he added.

"To my understanding. Greek Council is just an
informal group," said Salkln. “It’s there to help
groups with chartering problems. for example."

. "‘It meets Once every two weeks." explained

' Cheryl Eichel of the Alpha Epsilon. “It's there to
' help us not overlap parties."

k"'Abelow said the first effort to be sponsored by ’
. the Council will be an lntra-fraternlty and sorority
party to be held Sunday off-campus.

"Maybe In the future there will be frat houses on
campus, not justln the dorms." Abelow said. El
