tar "W5?  to Pin Crease Chances  

By Beth Flnneran
STAFF WRITER -

' Even a futile attempt to actuaiize a Star
Wars system would destroy the arms con-
trol process. escalate offensive and defen-
sive arms races and. according to Dr.
Robert Bowman, President of the Institute
for Space and Security'Studies. would in-
crease the danger that nuclear war will
occur.

Bowman said, in a March 26 lecture \t
the College of St. Rose. that the only
believable military use for the Star Wars

system is by “the aggressor who wants to "

get the missiles he missed in a first strike."

“ ‘Star Wars’ is too good and romantic
(a name).'it ought to be called Death Star
systems." said Bowman.

Bowman explained that Star Wars
would focus on intercepting Intercontinen-
tal Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) in “boost
phase" primarily because boosters are
fewer in number than the thousands of
warheads and decoys they transform into.

One thousand boosters will “MIRV” in-
to perhaps i0,000 warheads and 100.000
decoys. according to an issue paper cited
by Bowman.

The problem with this. Bowman claim-
ed. is that boost phase lasts only 40 lo 300
seconds which leaves virtually no time for
human response, thus resulting in the need
for a computer programmed reaction.
Bowman questioned the infallibility of
such an enormous program-as well as the
ability to "debug" it.

Bowman‘s skepticism for flawless
technology was illustrated when his talk
had to be delayed by a few minutes due to
faulty microphones. “What you're
witnessing ladies and gentlemen is what
will happen if we leave our future in the
hands of high technology." he said.

Other problems, according to Bowman.
are the vulnerability of defense space sta-
tions. which he said the Soviets could

eliminate them whenever they chose. and
the “eternal possibility" that nuclear
weapons could get through the defense
system.

Bowman disputed the claim that Star
Wars was an impetus to total disarma-
ment. In going from an offense-dominated
deterrence to a defehse-dominated disar-
mament,it is impossible, as of now. to
avoid passing through a totally unstable

Systems”

situation in which a disarming first strike is
not only possible. but likely. he said.

The offensive potential of Star Wars
was also cited by Bowman in his issue
paper. He noted that the capability of at-
tacking anything in space whether in the
airspace of potential adversaries or within
the sovereign territory of other nations
makes Star Wars a defensive "weapon."
not a defensive system.

Implementing Star Wars would breach
the ABM treaty. according to Bowman. In
his issue paper. “Star Wars and Arms
Control" he states, “...lf we insist on
abrogating that treaty and trying to make
Soviet missiles less effective. we can expect
them to take whatever steps are necessary
to maintain their offensive capabilities. in-
cluding building more and better nuclear
“fire arrows“ and ever-more powerful
anti-satellite “cannons” to blow holes in
our defenses.”

Citing the cost of a Star Wars system at

about a trillion dollars. Bowman'ciaimed,
“It’s possible for them to bankrupt
us...We can't afford that." '

Bowman also added. “The offense has
the economic leverage." thus citing
another impetus for an offensive arms
buildup by the Soviets.

According to Bowman. the American
people are being misled because the
military leaders' intentions for Star Wars
have nothing to do.with ending destruc-
tion. “They talk about protecting our of-
fensive weapons. so we have more of them
to retaliate with.. .that's how it's being sold
to Congress." 2 .
