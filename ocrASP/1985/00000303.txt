‘ Three SUNYA students attend-
ed the ﬁrst'Stu'dent Associatim
Academic Seminar at. SUNY
Binghamton during Spring Break.
Mike Miller. Academic Affairs
Chair at SUNYA, Rich Dalton
and ~Michelle Legendre were
Albany State's . p.’ ' Eves at
the conference. which also includ-
ed representativestdroin SUNY
Buffalo; Binghar'niOn. Platt-
sburgh. Oneonta. and Brockport.
The seminar consisted of a
series of intense discussions regar-
ding the improvement of
academics in all .schools"within
the SUNY'systemrv with primary
attention going to Albany. Buf-
falo anf Binghamton. the univer-
sity centers. said Miller.

According to Miller. many
resolutions resulted from this
conference. including calls for a
student union for SUNY Buffalo,
and improved advising, career
planning. and support services
throughout the SUNY system.

Miller added that there were
some vital resolutions passed per-
tinent to the Albany campus. A
five-year Bachelor's 'program
resolution was passed for
Business Majors. whom Miller
Teels “may be lacking in some im-
portant liberal arts areas like

' munications because of core

I_ uirements."

“The ﬁve-ypai program will

' provide} Business Majors with a

greater opportunity for a more

well-rounded education fivithou‘t "

the pressures of‘having to fulﬁll
the core requirements” in the cur.
rent four .year period.” Miller
said. '

the SUNYA campus as a result Of
the conference. Another resolu-
tion which Miller hopes to-see im-
plemented by next fall is Student
Course and Teacher Evalutions
(SCATE). The program. which is

registration processes. allows
students to read evaluations made
by other students about a speciﬁc
teacher or course.

“Right now the only source of
information to students regarding
certain professors or courses is
the grapevine. which is often
unreliable and usually inaccessi-
ble to freshmen or transfer
students." Miller said. adding,
"SCATE will provide students
with more diversiﬁed and impor-
tant information regarding cer-
tain .courses and hopefully pro-
vide them with a more accurate
option than could the
grapevine."

‘ State Agencies are demanding more from life

guards than just Advanced Life Saving Cer-

tificate (ALS) said Director of‘Safety for Red

Cross.;John Wagner. necessitating changes in

SUNYA's swim program. I
Wagner said Red Cross is “chartered by Con-

gress to supply (the) country with required ser-

vices" and there will be “major changes in the 1

next two to three years in the Water Safety
' (Department)."

ALS. a course offered by Red Cross. is design-
ed to train people for “personal safety in and
around the water." said Wagner. But the
“demands in (the) community show that‘s not
enough." '

More time in water front management is being
dema‘nded from state agencies. private camps
and private facilities. said Wagner. adding
“some agencies rcequire First Aid (and) CPR" in
addition to the ALS certificate.

There is a new Life Guarding course which is
geared "to fully train someone to beconte a life
guard." said Wagner. “The course entails train-
ing in recognizing people in trouble. spinal
management and deep water recusitaiion." it

SUNYA is the only college in
New York State and one of the

tunately. we are not as organized

also covers the usage of water treatment
chemicals. added Wagner. 4

' SUNYA Coach Ronald White said he feels the
Life Guarding course allows students to be better
trained and equipped for their duties.

First aid and Cardio Pulmonary Resucitation
are prerequisites for the Life Guarding course
but. according to Wagne’r. CPR and ﬁrst aid
learned in the ALS course is enough to apply for
the Life Guarding course.

White said “people hiring (life guards) say.
‘hey we need something better than just (an)
ALS‘ " certificate. This according to White. is
one of the reasons Red Cross is changing its cer-
tification requirements.

Wagner said he feels that Life Guarding
“might replace the ALS course" at some point.
but as of now everything is “up in the air" as to
what specific changes are going to he made.

Wagner said the WSi certificate is now being
accepted over the ALS certiﬁcate in many agen-
cies. According to Turnage. W8! is a course
which trains people to teach ALS and parts of
Life Guarding also.

White feels that Life Guarding. which is worth
3 credits at SUNYA. “is the remedy to (the)
need" for better life guard skills. 1 '
