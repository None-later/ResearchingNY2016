she criticized the Star: Wars plan. "Reagan

thought that he received a mandate for a.

buildup," said Glaros. “but his public
support and trust was being challenged in

Reagan had to do something." sh ’ .dded.

"The SDI was a brilliant political
stroke. It seems to emphasize defénﬁe. But
the war-ﬁghting strategies are still being
used in the pentagon." Glaros asserted.

“Reagan Is still preac'iing theperfc'ct

minutes to knock their missiles out. The
trajectory required would be very high.
And if they launched a ﬁrst strike, they
