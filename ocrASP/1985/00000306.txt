Last Friday marked the start of

the 8th Annual Albany invita-
‘tional Track and Field meet. Cor-
tland State won the meet with l82
points followed by Ithaca College
and Binghamton. Albany placed
ﬁfth. -

The meet saw many competitors
qualify for both the state meet
and even the NCAA Division III
Tburnament.
‘ Under overcast skies and steady
winds, many fine performances
were turned in by Albany women.

' However, as _ freshman Roseanne

Smith put it, “our schedule is
hectic with two meets a week now
and a speed workout in between.

But it’s beginning to pay off now
as people are running such good
times already." ~ -

At 9:30 Saturday morning. r
junior Bette Dzamba led the way
with a 38:15 10K. She ran the per-
sonal best virtually alone on her
way to victory. Junior Kris Varley
ran a very respectable 4i .26 for a
seventh place ﬁnish. ‘

Later in the day, junior Lynn
Jacobs, in a very exciting race,
ran l0:26.2_for fourth place. also
a personal best.

Other highlightsin the distance
events include junior Karen Kur-
thy’s seventh place, 18:41.8.
5,000-meter run. Sophbmorexim .
Pettichord ran a 5:0]..2.

Hagler stops Hearns l,
in thirdc-round ' '

‘Las Vegas, Nev.
(AP) Thomas Hearns had the
round right, but he picked the
wrong winner.

Hearns, who had promised to
knock out ‘Marvelous Marvin
Hagler in the third round, was
himself stopped at 2:01 of the
third after Hagler unleashed a
series of crushing right hands to
put the challenger on the canvas.

A dazed and battered Hearns
was carried back to his corner like
a rag doll, the loser of one of the

gmost action-packed. if brief,
‘1 lights in recent history. '

“I haven’t seen that much ac-
tion in three rounds ever," said

ureteree Richard Steele. who has

officiated bouts for l5 years.
Steele said he knew Hearns was

' -‘ hurt late in the second round after

Hagler hit him with several left
.hooks. After Hearns was decked
in the third round, Steele counted
to nine before waving the fight
over as Hearns struggled to his
feet. ' I

“i knew he'd had enough,"
Steele said. “His eyes were glazed
and his legs" were very wobbly.”

Hearns, who took about 30
minutes to be checked by doctors
before talking to the media, said
the fight would not be his last.

“I know this is not the end for
me," Hearns said. “Pin a winner.
.1 don't take defeat easily."

Hearns credited his rigorohs
training with helping ’him 'come ‘
out of the fight with no perma-
nent injury'. '

“l'm just glad I'm in great
physical shape. 1 thank the Lord
for letting me come out without
any damage," he said.

t ’ ' '
‘I haven t seen
that much actro'n
112 three rounds

as
CVCI'.

— Richard Steele

 

Hagler agreed that the second
round was the turning point of .
the bout. saying he sensed he had
Hearns at that point. . -

“i knew i had him in the third
round after he went back slow
after the second round," Hagler
said. ‘ '

A computer analysis of the
bout showed both lighters landed
about equal numbers of punches.
with Hagler connecting on 96 out
of 173 and Hearns finding the
mark with 94 of 166. But it was
Hagler's relentless attack that
managed to swarm through
Hearns' defense, landing the
harder punches. ‘

1.500-meter run, good enough for
second place in the unseeded
heat. ' ' v
Part of the team's success may

be attributed to distance coach.

Ron White's new philosophy this
season. instead of putting people
in" several events, he is letting his
runners choose their event and
compete in just that."The logic,
according to White. is for better
concentration.

“So far. I - think it’s good

because you don't get burnt out
with so many races in one meet.
“'5'. good he’s letting people
decide what they want to run."
said .lacobs. ' '
