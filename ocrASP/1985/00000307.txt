Albany trackmen defeat Rochester and Alfred

By Ian Clements
STAH‘ “INTER

The guy who said. “He who
hesitates is lost.“ never ran track
for Albany State.

The Dane tracksters proved
that patietice is not only a virttie
btit good for the record book.
They passed up two meets with
tough opponents due to inclement
weather before beginning their
season at the University of
Rochester with victories over their
hosts and Alfred University.

Albany scored 75 points. while
Rochester and Alfred had 72 and
65. respectively.

When a team witis a triangttlar
meet it usually has no shortage of
heroes and Saturday‘s meet was
no exception. as Albany had three
double winners. all seniors.

One of those seniors. Mike Rig-
gins. will be expected to perform
well each time he steps on the
track since two‘ of the team‘s most
talented sprinters did not come
out for the outdoor campaign.
Riggins responded to the
challenge with victories in the mo
and 200 meter dashes. He ran the
straightaway in l().9 seconds and
the half-Iapper in 22.5 seconds.

Weightnian Marc Mcrcurio has
faced pressure throughout most
of his collegiate career and has yet
to crumble under it. His victory in
the hammer throw was expected.
but was thrilling nonetheless as he
qualified for the national cham-
piotiship on his very first throw of
the season. llis‘ winning throw
was 174‘ 3“. His other victory
was iii the discus. which he hurled
NO' 3".

Jump specialist Patti Malice
was the third ten poitit scorer for
the Danes. He won the long iii 21‘
5'4" arid the triple in 43‘ 7".

()ne of the most exciting and
surprising performances for the

Danes was turned ill by

“At this point. we need a win
under our helt.“ said Ccrny.
“You can‘t he too sure since
teams change a lot iii a year. bttt
we should get one today."

Williamsvilie native blazed to an

excellent early-season 800 meter
time of l:57.2 but finished fourth
in a highly competitive field. The
time lowered his collegiate best by
two seconds.

John Reilly's 400 meter victory
was no surprise because he has
been running consistently since
the middle of the indoor season.
His time was 5l.0. Freshman Ed
Levy also placed with a 53.l split.

There were no winners among
the Albany distance runners but
they still provided many poitits.

Craig Parlato and Ted McGur-
rin began the scoring with their
2-4 finish in the l0.000 meterrun.
Parlato ran a fine 32:!8 iti his
first-ever 25-lapper.

The Danes clinched the victory

in the meet's next to last cvent.‘

the 5000 meter run. in which Ed
McGill and Pat Paul placed third
and fourth respectively. McGill‘s
titiie was 15:22. Paul‘s was I5:35.

Albany grabbed every scoring
position except first in the 3000
meter steeplcchase. The Dane
pack was led by junior Ray
Volper (9:554). He was followed
by Jack Glaser (l0:02.l) and
Charl'cs Blanchet 00:23.8).

The Danes got three points in
the l500 meter run from third
place finisher .lim Erwin 01:02.4)
and fourth placer Tim Cochise
(4103.8).

Freshman Mike'Bizovi was the
only Albany runner to score in the

 

hurdles. He placed fourth in the
“highs” in 16.0.

Though disappointed by the
lack of scoring in the hurdles due
to the absence of Bruce Van
Tassel. who has a minor foot in-
jury, Coach Bob Munscy was
delighted by the performance of
the 4 x 100 meter relay. which
won in 43.9. The team of Riggins.
Levy. Mike Gusmano and Reilly
made better handoffs than the
Rochester and Alfred teams. said
Munsey. “The second and third
(handoffs) were beautiful." he
said. “the third was what made
the difference."

Munsey had another winner in
freshman Curt Weidman. who
pole vaulted l3'. Pat Dowiing.‘in

his first outdoor performance for

the Purple and 'Gold. was third

with a l2' vault.

Four other newcomers scored
in the field events. Mike Nelson
was third in the javelin (138' 7’f).
while .lay Korscn was‘ fourth in
the hammer (96‘ ll").

Freshman Ajay Gupta. who tri-
ple jumped 4l' ii". and Bob
Balaehandron. who long jumped
l9' 8%". also scored.

Assistant Coach Chris Caliaci
said of the Danes‘ showing. “i
think it was the best team perfor-
mance in trackthis year." ‘

Albany's next meet will be

Saturday at Colgate. where they
will also face local rival R.P.l. El
