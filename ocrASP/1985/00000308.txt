Albany stunned by Cortland in'twinbill‘sweep

By Kristine Sauer

One week can make a big difference.
That‘s all the time the Cortland baseball
team needed before they took revenge
against Albany State.

Last Saturday. the Danes swept the
Dragons of Cortland State. 3-1. 4-3. in a
double header. This Saturday the
Dragons, after a week of simmering over
the loss. swept the Danes. 6-4, 6-5. The
Danes were in first place going into Satur-
day’s confrontation.

Actually. this goes to prove that not
much separates Cortland. Albany and
Binghamton. First place in the conference
is still up for grabs. Albany is 3-3 in the
conference. Cortland and Binghamton
also have 3 losses apiece. Oneonta hasn't
won a game yet.

in the opening game of Saturday’s
doubleheader, Cortland won 6-4. The
score was tied 2-2 in the third inning when
Herb Ceplda hit a solo home run to put
Cortland ahead 3-2 in the fourth. By the
top of the sixth inning. Cortland was
ahead 5-2.

The Dunes rallied to get within one dur-
ing the 6th. Left fielder Fred Saceoceio
singled. then advanced to second base on
Jei‘f McEachron's fielders choice.
Designated hitter Rudy Lacartii singled in
a run to set the score at 5-3. Lacardi stole
second base. Pinch hitter Craig Wallace
walked before Adam Pullman singled in a
run to bring the Danes within one, 5-4,
before the inning ended.

The Dragons scored in the 7th inning on
their first batter up. Sam Millrieh doubled
then went to third on a wild pitch and
home on another pitching miscue. The
Danes' defense held Cortland for the rest
of the inning.

The Danes last chance in the seventh was
unsuccessful. With men on first and se-
cond and one out. Saccoccio hit into a
force play with the lead runner nailed.
With two outs and men on first and se-
cond. again McEachron grounded to the
pitcher to end the game.

Pitching for the Danes was Chris Flet-
cher. who was relieved by John Kalinsky in
the seventh. Cortland's Brian Cross was
replaced by Paul Fedgo in the sixth. The
Dragons had 13 hits while Albany had only
seven.

in the second game. the Danes lost by
one. 6-5. Cortland opened up a sizeable
lead scoring a run in the first. two in the
3rd and then two in the fourth to mount a
5-0 lead. Three of the players that scored
reached base on walkls.

in the fifth inning, the Danes‘ defense
held the Dragons to nothing and were able
to get on the scareboard on a run by
Lacardi to make it 5-1.

"This is when we started to play some
solid defense," said assistant coach Stu
Bultcr. “it was a little too late though."

Cortland scored in the top of the sixth to
t’ake a five run lead. (H. The next two inn-
ings were crucial for the Danes. especially
