his potential as a Yankee phenom

By Dean Chang

“Strike threel"

Orestes Destrade heard the words ringing in his
ears. words that mean failure for a baseball batter.
words that Des trade had heard once too often last
year. a year he would rather keep behind him.

Destrade walked slowly to the bench. bat in
hand. Two years ago. that bat was a lethal
weapon. prompting the New York Yankees to pro‘
tect him on their 40-man roster last year. a con-
siderable achievement for a first baseman in
Single-A ball. But last year. Destrade‘s bat shot
blanks. at least by the standards used to judge
major-league prospects.

Playing for the Fort Lauderdale Yankees in 1983.
Destrade batted .292 with 18 home runs. 74 runs
batted in and 82 walks. earning him a promotion
to the Yankees' Double-A farm club in Nashville
the following year. But a slow start put Destrade
back into Fort Lauderdale. a city he had next
hoped to visit in spring training as a New York
Yankee. _

“Mentally. he was a little bit down." said Dave
LaRoche. former pitching coach of the Fort Lauder-
dale team. now coach of the Albany-Colonie
Yanks. Destrade's new team. "He had a good year
before. and he didn't feel he belon ed there."

According to Destrade. Nashville idn't give him
a fair chance. "They tried to pla me in left field in
Nashville." said Destrade. “T at hindered me.
They probably felt that at my height. 1 moved fair-
ly well. 1 didn't mind it. but the knew i wasn't a
bonafide outfielder. They shoul 've stuck with me
a little more: they gave up on me a little too
quickly."

"it‘s a grounder to ﬁrst, the throw to the pitcher
covering. and Destrade is out at first. "

Better than last time. but still not what the
Yankees are expecting from this 22-year old
switch-hitter. At Nashville. Destrade batted .240
with six home runs and only 12 runs batted in. At
Fort Lauderdale. he hit 12 home runs with 57 R1315.
but batted only .221. Numbers like that do not
make major-league rospects: the Yankees did not
place Destrade on t e 40-man roster this year.

‘ "That came as no surprise to me." said Destrade

“1 didn't feel i deserved to. and i came to camp
with that thought in mind. i was happy to be pro-
tected on the Triple-A roster."

Unhappy with himself, Destrade decided to
spend the off-season in Columbia playing winter
ball. a move that made sense to the Yankees.

"You get a chance to play against higher competi-
tion." said Roy White. the Yankees' Assistant
General Manager. “There are guys there that pla
in the majors; the pitchers have better contro.
Most of the winter leagues are close to Tri le-A."

Destrade redeemed himself in Columbia, atting
.314 with 12 home runs and 40 RBis in only 45
games. restoring his self-confidence.

"i think the Yanks took notice of what i did.“
said Destrade. “i've shown them that i've made a
turnaround. "

 

"Crackl"

The sound was unmistakable: the 6'4".

ZiO-pound Destrade watched as the ball ﬂew over
the right-field fence as he rounded the bases his
next time up. This is what the Yankees had hoped
for when they signed him as a free agent out of a
junior college in Florida three and one-half years
ago.
"He has unlimited offensive potential." said
LaRoche. "Once he gets confidence in himself.
he'll start blossoming. if he ever harnessed his
ability. he can hit 30 home runs and 100 RBIs in
the majors every year. if."

if. A man's career depends on a two~letter word.
The talent is obviously there: witness the seeming-
ly effortless swing it took to propel one of Rawl-
ing's finest more than 350 feet away. Destrade is
out to prove that last year was a fluke.

"i'm confident that i can play at a major-league
level." said Destrade. “But for now. i'm trying to
think present. 1 want to do well in Albany. and
hopefull bring a championship to them." .

Even i Destrade puts up the numbers expected
of him. there's no guarantee of him ever becoming
a New York Yankee. Someone named Don Mat-
tingly gives the impression that he might be
around for a few years at first base.

"The Yankees are a tough organization." said the
man his teammates call '0'. "if ou've made it
with them. you've made it with t e best. Donny
Mattingly is the first baseman of the future: my on-
ly chance is if they move him to the outfield."

Despite having arguably the best hitter in
baseball in front of him. Destrade never lets thr
futility of his situation get to him.

“You can't be thinkin like that." said Destrade
"You have a Job at han . and you have to do it. ifi
thought like that. I'd give up. if i can't make it with
the Yankees. i'm hoping some other teams will
notice me. But right now. i'm giving the Yankees
110 percent."

Last year Destrade played with Mark Johnston. a
long-time minor-leaguer who gained notoriety for
being on the Late Night with David Letterman
show. Johnston spoke of a different baseball
world. one that most baseball fans were unaware
of; the glitter of the majors has not rubbed off on
the minor-league system.

Johnston. who is no longer with the Yankee
organization. was Destrade's lockermate in Fort
Lauderdale.

"He‘s a very interesting type of guy."
remembered Destrade. "He was in the minors for
seven. eight years. so he's seen a lot. You have to
love the game to stay that long.“

Destrade has no such plans. in seven or eight
years. you will either see him in a maJor~league
uniform. or you will not see him at all.

"There's only so much you can do in the
minors." said Destrade. "i wouldn't like to be
there for more than two or three years further. i
feel i'm only one solid year from the bigs."

Still. Destrade wouldn't trade his lifestyle for
anything. except for maybe a chance to play in the

Look out Albany. Here comes the Yankees.

No. you won't see names like Winfield. Henderson and Mattingly in the
line-up. How about Destrade. Hughes and Lombardi? The way the New
York Yankees are playing. those names might be interchangeable. this

ear.
yThe coaching team of Barry Foote and Dave LaRoche will be seeking
their second pennant in as many tries: the two led the Class-A Fort‘
Lauderdale Yankees to a title last year in the Florida Stat_e League.

What the team lacked in talent. it made up in desire and bustle. two
things that you can expect to find in any team} Foote manages.

"Barry Foote baseball is very ressive baseball." said Foote. "We'll.
steal. even steal home. break up ouble plays — We'll do things the way’
the old players did. We'll always take the extra base: we want to dictate
the game to the other team. rather than have them dictate to us."

When the players step on the field. they know what Foote expects from
them. especially those who played under him in Fort Lauderdale.

“Between those white lines." said Foote pointing to the first and third:
base lines. “it's war. After the game. you can go out to dinner. But if you;
don't break up a double play because the second baseman is your friend.
you can walk." .

Of the 24 players on the roster. 15 of them played for Foote and LaRoche
at one point last year. Some believe that the transition frem SingleA to
Double-A is the hardest one a player will have toma'ke in his pro career.

behind the plate. Lombardi is.probably the best prospect on the team.
While Lindsey saw time at all three minor-league levels last year.
"We'll be strong defensi‘vely’and offensivel behind the plate." said
Foote. a former catcher. "They shouldhave“ i ‘seasbns alternating: i
expect 75. 80 RBIs and 10 to 15 'home runs from the two of them.
They'll do a good job defensively, throwing people out. I'll be
disappointed and they'll be disappointed if they don't."

First Base: Orestes Destrade might be the most naturally talented
player on the team. Coaches use glowing terms to describe the switch-
hitting power hitter who is coming off a disappointing year.
"Destrade is on the brink of having the season we think he can
pave." said Foote. “He's capable of hitting 20 home runs and 100 R815
or us." -

Second Base: Like Destrade and many other of his teammates. Ron
Chapman played in Fort Lauderdale last year, hitting .260 in 281 at-
bats.

"Chapman is very aggressive." said Foote. "He makes things
happen. He’ manufactures runs. and-is as fast as anyone ih camp. He'll
do a good Job for us."

Shortstop: Matt Gallegos saw limited action for the Yankees’
DoubleA team. which' was in Nashville last year. The San Francisco

Under LaRoche‘s guidance. the Yankees will also be getting some .

LaRoche participating. You might think that the Yan would not want
the creator of LaLob teaching young pitchers. but evidently LaRoche is
doing something right. .

“My philosophy is to be as simple as 1 can with the kids." said LaRoche.
"i'm not oing to fool myself into thinking that i'm the smartest person in
the worl . Hopefully. 1 can use the experience I have and attempt to help
t em."

And when will LaRoche start teaching his pupils LaLob? .r .

‘ Hollywood. Florida
For most of the Albany-Colonic Yankees. prac-
tice was over on this sun-drenched April day in
Hollywood. Florida.
it was five o'clock now. nine hours after the
team first stepped onto Boggs Field — the Yankee
DoubleA training facility. which is a 20-minute
drive from the major league camp in Fort
Lauderdale.
This strenuous day —'- highlighted by a scrim-

. mage against the Triple-A Columbus Clippers

sandwiched between two practice sessions -- was
all but finished.

As the players were dispersing to the clubhouse.
Albany-Colonie Yankee manager Barry Foote an-
nounced if anyone was interested in competing in

a one-mile race around the perimeter of Boggs‘

Field. offering five dollars to the winner.

Three players took Foote up on his offer — one of
them being Phil Lombardi :- a 22-year old player
being billed by sOme as the top catching prospect
in the organization.

Lombardi didn't capture the five dollar first prize
money; not exactly known for his running ability.
Lombardi placed second. What Lombardi did cap-
ture. though. was another measure of respect from
his manager.

While most of his mates were getting a headstart
on the night's activities. Lombardi was churning
out another mile in the burning Florida sun. look-
ing to improve his abilities in any way he can.

“1'” do anything to win a game." said Lombardi.
after practice. his face colored with a deep orange
tan. “i'll do anything to make myself a better
ballplayer.-"

Foote is familiar with Lombardi's strong drive
toward success. This season will mark the second
year Foote and Lombardi will be on the same
team. in Foote's first year as a manager. he led the
Single-A Fort Lauderdale Yankees to the Florida
State League Championship. with Lombardi play-
ing a vital role to the team's success.'Now the duo
have been promoted to the Double-A level.

in this instance. there seems to be a special
closeness between the manager and player —
perhaps the tight bond an ex-major catcher and a
22-year old catching prospect should feel.

"He's (Lombardi) learned a lot from Barry." said
Jim Saul. the third base coach. "He's learning some
of the finer points of catching. not Just the basic
fundamentals. that anyone can teach."

Foote cringes when asked if he spends more
time with Lombardi than the other players: "1
hope that i spend the same amount of time with
eve one. it's true that i feel more attached to

n .Lo rdi. i feel there is so much morel could

teach-him." .

So does the Yankee organization. which is one of
the reasons why Lombardi is playing Double-A
ball this season. Some. including Foote. feel Lom-
bardi has the talent to play Triple-A.

"i'm happy that the organization hasn't tried to

rush me." said Lombardi. a husky 6’2" 200 ' ‘

pounder. "What they're doing is trying to get me
to build my confidence on the Double-A level.

And there is still so much more i can learn from g "

Barry."

There have been quite a few top catching pro: 

spects in the recent past for the Yankees. The

names live on in infamy: Mike Heath. Jerry Nar~ 

ron. Brad Gulden. and Bruce Robinson to present a

few. Foote doesn't believe Lombardi's name will ‘

wind up on that unfavorable list.

"He's the best catching prospect i’ve seen since
i've been in the organization." said Foote. "if he
doesn‘t make it to the big leagues in two to three
years. i'll be disappointed."

First. Lombardi must show he can make the step
from Single-A ball to Double-A. "i hear from
ever body that the biggest Jump is going from
Singl’e-A to Double-A." said Lom ardi. "it's a lot
tougher than going from Double-A to Triple-A."

After Lombardi's first two years in the Yankee

organization. there were doubts that Lombardi. V

would even make it this far. Signed in 1981 as an
18- ear old high school phenom out of Grenada.
Caflfornia. Lombardi stru led through two
frustrating seasons of rookie all. He hit .255 for
Sarasota in 1981 and even less the next year for
Paintsville SKentucky).

"l was sti l at a point where i wasn't used to the
whole thing." said Lombardi. "being away from

I .home)..traveling all over the place."

The. Yankees gave Lombardi one more chance by

where he finally displayed the talent they saw in
him in high school. Lombardi's batting average
soared to the .2905. while his throwing arm started
becoming a threat to the ﬂeet-footed. However. his
handling of pitchers and taking control of a game
was still a question mark.

Last gear. when Lombardi Joined the Fort
Lauder ale Yankees. Foote began to erase that
question mark‘and sketch an' exclamation point.
The Fort Lauderdale squad captured the Florida
State league championship and Lombardi had a
lot to do with it. Batting .293 with 8 home runs and
70 RBis. Lombardi became a fixture behind home
plate. it was obvious that Foote had a positive ef-
fect on Lombardi. in this winter's instructional
League. Lombardi tore up the league. hitting .344.

“He's helped the kid more than anyone else
did." said Bobby Hoffman. Director of Player
Personnel.

"Lombardi is taking advantage of a good situa-
tion." said Dave LaRoche. Albany's pitching coach.
who also is moving up from the Fort Lauderdale
squad. He improved a lot last year. He seems to be
more relaxed laying under Barry."

What is the ifference between the present Lom-
bardi and Lombardi in the pre-Foote era? Ask the
former major league catcher.

"What i tried to do with Lombardi last season
and this year is to make him into a thinking cat-
cher." said Foote. "To teach him how to outguess
a hitter. what to call on a 2-2 count. He's a very in-
telligent person; players like him don't come along
too often." - .

Foote is planning on having Lombardi's bat in
the lineup almost everyday. either behind the
plate or as a designated hitter. Phil Lindsey. the
other catcher. also has a decent hat. but doesn't
compare to Lombardi in the field.

Most coaches agree that Lombardi's best asset is
his powerful throwing arm. But his power at the
plate with a bat in hand also must be reckoned
with. A, line drive hitter. Lombardi'shome run
production. though. has been disappointing. But
the Yankee coaches are afraid of tampering with
his swing.

"We want him to continue to do what he's doing
and that's hitting line drives in the gaps." said Roy
White. who is now the assistant general manager.
"He doesn't have any weak points as a hitter. He's
a good line contact hitter and we're not going to
change his style.“

"He's ot the same style as Thurman (Munson)
did." oﬁgered Foote. "He still has the potential to
hit 20 homers a year."

Recently. the Yankee farm system has not been
regarded as a haven for a minor league prospect
on the rise. The Yankees. under the George Stein-
brenner reign. have the reputation of trading away
prospects as quick as- they go through managers.

However. Lombardi seems to be in a rather cozy
position. Catching talent in the Yankee organiza-
