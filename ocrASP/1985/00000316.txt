SIAM ll'IiIfER '
Barnes“ and Noble is turning

Pat Hayes. SUNYA Barnes and

Noble's new manager. With

Hayes comes a new computer

backs. 
.OHE‘iESYXMiﬁ Profile

March after

woiking for nine months ina
Barnes and Noble outlet at the
University of New Hampshire.
Hayes said he hopes his stay at
Albany‘s store will be longer than
his previous stay at New
Hampshire.

“I would like to be able to stay
for a couple of years before
transferring so that i can see if my
efforts have been effective." he
said.

Hayes. who replaced Marj
Campbell after her transfer to
Wayne State, said he welcomes
the” challenge of managing
Albany’s store especially because
of its size, which is 1V: times that
of New Hampshire’s store.
“Because of its greater size 1 can,
do a lot more innovating here
than i could have in either
Bridgeport or New Hampshire,"
he added. ' '

Hayes has already. begun
changes. This is exemplified by
the new display of Epson com-
puters and printers which will be
sold at about 15 percent of the
manufacturers list price. accor-
ding to Hayes. He has decided to

utilizéﬁthe‘Computers presence try ‘

using it to 'expand upon the'italf
price buy back list.

According _ to Hayes, many
books were bought back from the
students at costs below'haif price
because the publisher was too
small and demand for the books
was diminutive. With the help of
the new computer. Hayes has
compiled a list of all books in the
bookstore and is currently expan-
ding the “half price list" by about
40 percent.

Dina Roman, v the assistant
manager. said she feels there is a
need for computers all over cam-
pus and sees the bookstore’s new
addition as a valuable beneﬁt.

An employee at Barnes and
Noble. Meeghan Mcnamara, said
“because he (Hayes) is new, no
one has really gotten to know him
yet. but he seems like a mellow,
easy going. accomodating kind of
guy." she said. _ '

“Although the computers real-
ly came at about the same time
Hayes got here." Mcnamara said.
Hayes “is the one that kicked

' everything off." 1
“He's got a lot of new ideas,"

said Mcnamara. pointing to the
way he's “logistically changed the
store around. but i don't know

about the business part." she .

said.

Hayes’ goals as the new
manager include developing bet-
ter communications between the
store and the students.
“Bookstores tend to have a bad
reputation because it is. here
where students must purchase
books that they really don't want
to read." he said.

One way Hayes said he plans
on improving relations with the
students is by increasing from six
buyers to ten this spring and also
by having the buybacks held out-
side rather than in the tunnels for
tlte first time ever.

 

Hayes, who will be married In
June. said he believes the store

- will probably benefit from chang-

ing managers but added that "this
store has a strong staff of
management personnel which will
make my transition much

smoother." He said he sees no
major differences between
himself and Campbell. the former
manager. yet is eager to com-
municate with the students and
listen to possible reforms and
ideas for improvements that they

might have.
' "i am available to hear
3 students' suggestions and am
eager to develop better relations
with the student body.” he said.
Students wishing to see Hayes can

Mcnamara said Hayes is very

“and he says thank you when
you‘re done. " Cl

 

Students vvill march on Capitol in protest of 21

By Donna MacKenzio ‘
and Pam Schusterman

Close to 1,000 students are expected to begin marching at l-l:00
am. April 23 from Alumni Quad down to the Capitol building in a
statewide protest against raising the drinking age.

The anti-2| rally. to be staged by the combined efforts of The
Student Association of the State University (SASU) and SUNYA's
Student Action Committee. is “the culmination
of two years ofeffort," according to Larry Hart- 
man. Student Action vice chair. The rally was an- .
nounced at Wednesday night's Central Council 
meeting.

Participating in'the rally. Hartman said. will
be students from all the SUNY schools plus Sienna, Hudson Valley
Community College and Rockland Community and Renselear
Polytechnic institute. “Students will be bused to Albany from their
respective schools." he said.

According to Hartman, the day will begin with a march to the
Capitol. and then proceed with a series of speakers. a radio
talkshow, and live entertainment.

“The speakers will include senators and assemblymen." said
Hartman. “and we are expecting press coverage." He added.

 

"SASU has even sprttng for free l-shirts and caps."

The students particpating will be lead by 50 marshal] leaders who
will "run the show" and make sure the crowd is effective, said
Hartman.

The day will end with a massive lobbying effort inside the
Capitol. Hartman explained. "we want the legislature to realize
what a large voting block we are."

A tnassivc publicity campaign will be in effect beginning Sunday
night, added Hartman. “We feel if people know about the issue.
there will be no trouble getting them down to rally."

According to Hartman. the efforts against 2i will not end with
the rally. “We still have planned a major letter writing campaign as
well as a pitonc banking campaign."

Also in Central Council Wednesday another person was ap-
pointed to the Election Commission. making Grcg Kearns the
newest Commission member. 1

Steve Landis. in introducing the bill. said that, "internal Affairs
had not bccn able to interview him. so his nomination is coming
before you without a recommendation."

Kearns had served as a Commissioner during Wednesday's
balloting and therefore the vote was pro forma. added Landis.

The bill appointing Kearns passed 19-0-2 in a roll-call vote. [.3
