Robot helps doctors

Long Beach. CA
(UPI) A kitchen mixer sized robot described as
safer and more accurate than a surgeon's hand has
helped doctors successfully remove a tumor in the
first application of robotics in human brain
surgery.

Dr. Yik San Kwoh. who developed the computer
program that makes the arm work. said the
machine ‘will never replace the surgeon in the
operating room. but it is a major improvement in
the way tumors are located and removed from the
brain. ‘

“The robotic arm is safer. faster and far less in-
vasive than current surgical procedures and has a
degree of accuracy that no human could hope to
match." Kwoh said.

Women’s jobs discussed

A conference titled "Ingredients for Women’s
Employment Policy" will beheld Friday at Alumni
House.

The conference will bring together scholars who
study women's employment from theoretical. cm-
piricai. and policy-oriented viewpoints to determine

The conference was organized by Chris Bose and
Glenna Spitze of the Sociology department.

of the National Gay Task Force and Peter Drago.
Governor Cuomo's liason to the gay community.
several workshops and the showing of several films

ding that most of the events are free.

Trees cleared for ramp

You might be wondering why approximately 200
square feet of trees have been removed on the north
side of Washington Ave.. across the street from
SUNYA.

The work is part of a massive project aimed at
improving road conditions on the Northway, in the
Albany area. according to Richard Cotton. the
engineer in charge of the project, and an employee
of the New York State Department of traffic.

Right now. according to Cotton. the work being
done is phase I ofa 5 phase 2'year project. New en-
trance and exit ramps are being constructed across
the street from SUNYA. says Cotton. and at the

end of the 2 year period several exits will have been ‘

redesigned. and several improvements such as new
concrete dividers and new traffic signals will have
been installed.

The work is necessary. according to Cotton, to
accomodatc traffic frbm SUNYA. and other rdads
in the area. ‘

A student examines a Holocaust exhibit in front of campus center

 

HOWARD TVGAR UF’S

 

About 80 students gathered

Thursday to commcratc Yom-
Ha-Shoah. Holocaust Remem-
brance 'Day, and to vent anger
about President Reagan's trip
to the Bitburg Cemetary in
Germany where approximately
50 members of the Waffen SS
are buried. Reagan will lay a
wreath at the site.

Even though Reagan has
conceded to visit the Dachau
Concentration Camp, Stuart
lsralowitz. chair of World
Jewry for JSC-Hillcl said. "It's
a cop-out. He's going there on-
ly because of the pressure
Jewish groups have given
him."

Earlier this week Reagan an-
nounced that he would visit a
concentration camp. either
Dachau or Bergen-Belsen.
Reagan had previously said
that instead of “re-awakening
the memories" of the war. he
wanted to “commemorate the

past-war friendship between
the United States and West
Germany.”

“That‘s not enough of a
concession.” contined
lsralowitz. “It's insulting to
Jews and all others who fought
against the Nazis to visit that

 

funeral."

Holocaust Remembrance Day was Thursday

Reagan ’3 'plans draw anger
at mem‘oriam ‘of Holocaust

in front of the Campus Center a. ceremony.

t h c c a m p u s
in which six
yahrzeit. or memorial candles.
were lit in honor of the six
million Jews who perished,
Rabbi Baruch Frydman~Kohl
of Congregation Ohav-Shalom
in Albany said. “we observe
this day so not to ever forget.
There are those who claim it
never happened or who try to
make us forget. We must also
remember that Jews were
slaughtered along with
homosexuals. Gypsies. Poles
and countless other people."

During

“We cannot allow the presi-l
dent to say that we cannot
allow Germans to suffer with
guilt for the Nazi past. We
must be outraged at Reagan to
equqte murderers — the SS
waffe -— with the martyrs killed
in Auschwiti. Birkenau. These
were people. not animals. who
killed Jews.” said Frydman-
Kohl. I.

“We must also remember
those who did Help Jews. Raoul
Wallcnberg. the\ village of
LeChambour Stir Lyons." ad-
dcd Frydman-Kohl. "But these
are far too few." \

YonI Ha-Shoah is the
memorial of the Warsaw Ghet-
to uprising in April. .

As of Wednesday. Iii more
people than last year signed up
for on-campus housing according
to Associate Director of Residen-
tial Life. Paul Doyle.

“We're tightening our belts by
increasing occupancy. We‘re
planning to place I80 more
students in the dorms than we did
last year." said Doyle.

The enforcement of the
grouper law is part of the reason
this ’-has been done Doyle
confirmed. .

Ninety bedrooms on Alumni
Quad and 45 suites on each quad
uptown will be reserved for in-
coming freshmcn said Doyle. ad-
ding “we'vc done this in anticipa-
tion of greater demand for hous-
ing next year."

“This is the first time that we

I have set aside housing for incom-
ing freshmen prior to the sign«up
of all others," he said.

These rooms and suites that
were set aside are considered “in-
creased locations.“ The rooms on
Alumni will be tripled. and two of
the three bedrooms in the suites
reserved for freshmen will be
tripled.

“We're also going to distribute
the incoming class equally on
each quad. We don't see the need
to segregate the freshmen." said
Doyle.

FR-IDA Yg‘APRIL [941985.10 ALBANY'STUDENT PRESS 

Some students however say
they do not feel this system is fair.
According to Rachel Braslow, a
freshman who lives on State
Quad. “this system of reserving
rooms for incoming freshmen
before housing sign-up is forcing
many of this year's freshmen to
stay on State. State will be 25 per-
cent freshmen, and 75 percent
sophomores. I don‘t know of any
sophomores or juniors who
transferred to State."

“When I went to sign up for
housing on Thursday." Braslow
explained. “for women there was
one six-person suite left on In-
dian. Dutch had three fivc~pcrson
suites left. and about l2 6-person
suites left on Colonial. with only
two in the tower." She added that
she and most other first year
students signed up for housing on
Thursday due to their low
priority.

“There was also a lot of
‘ghosting.’ Five freshmen and a
'ghost' went yesterday.“ said
Braslow. ‘Ghosting' refers to
when students who are planning
to live off-campus sign up for on-
cumpus housing in order to com-
plete friends' suites or to give
them higher priorities.

Last year. 291 students got
refunds in September after sign-
ing up for housing in April.
“Ghosting is very hard to con-
trol." said Doyle.

   aboungptnén

"A lot of people did not Want
to remain on State," said
Braslow. “Many students did not
want to be placed in the middle of
tha Beta Tau. Alpha Epsilon Pi.
and Pi Lambda Phi. three frater-
nities who will be living on
State.”

“I didn't want to stay on State
because of the frats." said
freshman Ferna Gclfman.
"They‘re very selective about the
people they let in their circle.
They screen everyone."

Kcith Katie. a member of ZBT
said. “three-quarters of the
fraternity will be living on State,
mostly in the tower. We didn't
want to split up. All those in the
frat who wil be on campus will be
on State." Kane added that these
suites weren‘t designated for [rats
and that they just took them.

There is only housing space for
two hundred graduate students,
leaving those living in violation of
the grouper law in a dilcmna.
“We don‘t know what we'll do
with a grad student who needs
housing after being evicted." said
Doyle. “Transfer options will be
similar to those in the past. We'll
try and do all we can." he added.

“We're eagerly awaiting this
year's budget." said Doyle. “It
should indicate the pessibilily of
creating new housing.“

"People are really let] up uith
