 ‘ Referenda

 

«Front Page
STAFF chair Craig Rocker refused to
call the vote a defeat saying. “sometimes
obtaining your rights takes time.” ,
.Rucker‘rcmained optimistic after only

3| percent of the voters voted against the _

NYPIRG funding system. "it‘s a start."
he said. “We have a long way to go. ob-
viously. but we’ll be back in two years."
NYPIRG’s funding system is voted on in a
campus wide referendum every two years.

‘I have to hand it to NYPlRG.” Rueker
continued. “They‘re a ,very popular
organization."

SA President Rich Schaffcr said that the
nuclear freeze referendum vote
“demonstrates that the arms race is
definitely on the mind of the university
community."

“This should send a clear message to
ottr representatives to push President
Reagan and his advisers to work with the
Soviets for a stop to this madness." Schaf—
fer said. adding. "I’m surprised that 15
percent voted against the freeze."

Schaffer and President-elect Steve
Gawley. who is currently Student Action
chair. were both pleased that the SA man-
datory activity fee was approved.

“i think the students realize the benefits
of having a student association on cant-
pus." Schaffer said. continuing “without
the fee. we wouldn‘t have any legitimacy
with the city or with the administration
here."

“The mandatory fee is the basis for all
Stttdcnt Association services," said
Gawley. “I don‘t think I would have run
for SA President if I thought the man-
datory fee wouldn‘t be approved." .

Gawley. who is also currently a Student
Association of the» State University
(SASU) delegate. said he was also pleased
that the referendum to increase SASU fun-
ding passed. “SASU has been a powerful
force on this campus for years, working on
broad based student issues," Gawley said.

Sehal'fcr was pleased by the referendum
results in general. “It shows that this

nation-wide movement to defeat groups
like NYPIRG and SASU and mandatory
fees for student associations are going to
fail.” he said. “Students won't be fooled
’by misinformation."

ing. and predicted turnout of60-6S percent
in his favor in the runoff.

When asked what qualities he felt he had
that would get him the vet. Abelow stated
that he is “experienced but not an SA in-
sider." and mentioned his previous work
for students’ rights, as well as his’work on
Quad Boards and with ‘Student
Association.

Abelow also said that he felt he would
work well with Gawley if elected because
“i have worked with hint before on Stu-
dent Action Committee and am looking
forward to working with him in the future
on student rights and programming."

Despite Abelow's 46 percent showing.
Chris Thomas said simply that he was
“very pleased” with the election results
and that he planned to campaign for the
run—off.

Thomas also mentioned that he felt he
and Gawley would work well together.
stating that they are “very good friends."

Overall. voter turnout was considerably
higher than last year. 29 percent Of the
eligible voters turned out. which is approx—
imately 9 percent higher than last year. ac-
cording to SA” President Rich Sehaffer. i

the housing process." said Braslow. “This
idea of distributing freshmen is ludicrous.
lt discriminates against those of us who are
freshmen now. There's nothing wrong
with a freshmen quad."

“We are going to handle the housing
situation in the fall. We never know what
will happen in the future." said Doyle. l1
