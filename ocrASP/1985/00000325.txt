N.Y. isles: The comeback
kids must come back again

(AP) Call it character. the ability
to reach dowrt for something ex-
tra to survive a crisis.

Call it grit. the refusal to accept
the assessment ofothers. the drive
to ignore overwheitning odds.

Call it the New York islanders.

A decade ago. the islanders
were brand new to the intensity of
tire National Hockey League
Stanley Cup playoffs. They won
their first playoff series in a final
game overtime against the New
York Rangers. in the second
roundfnthcy lost three straight
games in a best-of-seven series to
the Pittsburg Penguins.

Poised on the brink of Ciilltilla'
tiott. the islanders merely bounc-
ed off the deck and won t'our
straight. a neat and rarely ac-
complished bit of tiptoeing along
a tightrope.

in the next series. the Stanley
Cup semifinals. they very nearly
did it again. losing the first three
to Philadelphia and then rallyirtg
to take the next three before los-
ing the seventh game. .

Those thee series statnped the
islanders as a‘ special team. a
hockey club that could not be
written off. They had faced
elimination eight times and won
every showdown to stay alive un-
til thc Flyers stopped them.

A year later. in the quarter-
finals against Buffalo. they lost
the first two games attd then won
four in a row. They were
establishing a tradentark. giving
the NHL something to think
about.

New. fast-forward a decade.
past the four straight Stanley
Cups which were won with a
minimum of crisis situations. to
1985 and the islanders' disappear-
ing dynasty.

Last summer. they were replac-
ed as Cup kings by Edmonton.
They drifted to ii third place
Patrick Division finish this
season. surrendering a
nightmarish 3l2 goals. the most
since their first season when they
were a woeful expansion fran-
chise. Their critics said they were
old and used up. their era over.

And it certainly seemed that way .

when they opened the playoffs
with a pair of tottgh overtitne
losses against one of the league's
better young teams. the
Washington Caps.

So there they were. balancing

tenuousiy on the edge of elimina-
tion again.

General Manager Bill Torrey
and Coach Al Arbour evaluated

the teatn's psyche on the trip‘

home after those two games and
they thought they recognized the
resolve to survive. the character.
the grit. this team has
demonstrated so often before.

,“There was no finger pointing.
no sense that we were whipped."
Torrey said. "instead. there was
a very strong feeling of ‘We‘ll
find a way to win.‘ Al told them
to play it one shift at a time. it
was the satne speech he used in
Pittsburgh it) years ago."

The task. the islanders were
told. was not to win three straight
gatttcs against a very good
Washington team. it was instead
to win their individual 90-second
shifts. Win enough shifts. you
win the period. Win enough
periods. you win the game. The
mountain doesn‘t seem quite that
high when you look at it that way.

Another comeback ac-
complished. Torrey was asked if
it had been better than the one
against Pittsburgh a decade ago.

“Different. ttot better." he
said. “That's a good hockey team
we beat. a very sound team. a bet~

'ter team than Pittsburgh was. We

were kids i0 years ago. Now
we're supposed to be a bunch of
old crocks. Whey they write you
off. tell you you're washed up.
there‘s a tremendous satisfaction
in coming back. v

Now the isles are in another
playoff series. facing the regular
season chatnpion Flycrs.

Philadelpltia. like the Caps. is f

young and talented. and it beat
the islanders 3-0 in their series
opener. But after watching the
islanders’ trademark comeback
against the Caps. they have plenty
to think about. i]

Rugby queens. The knees and shoulders
are. as in other sports. the most vulnerable
areas. The face however. takes a beating in
rugby that may be unique. Black 'eyes.
broken noses. general lacerations and con-
tusions are all ‘ relatively - common. That
tends to happen when-full grown men run
into each other at full speed with no pro-
tective gear.

The guys that play the sport are com-
paratively normal between games. They do
not- loot and pillage. nor do they live in
caves. Some even go to class quite regular-
ly. Then. on game day. some Jekyll-Hyde
transformation, takes place and they

seem to respect each other for the common
ordeal, that they share.

As brutal as the game itself is. the post-
game festivities are just as much a test of
human endurance. Teams that. earlier in
the day.,.went to war on the rugby ﬁeld,
come together to drink away the pain.
Here. the Viking tradition is most evident.
There are a number of customary activities
that call to mind Viking warriors returning
home with the spoils of their conquest.
Drinking songs are the main diversion.
Lusty. filthy. often vulgar drinking songs
that all the players know by heart. Then.
there's the tradition of “shooting the
boot." This involves guzzling beer from
the shoe of a fellow player. Having engag-
ed in this peculiar activity a number of
times. i'can testify that it's not for the
queasy. That's just the beginning. though.
A number of individual acts of perversion.
too disgusting to print. take place.

Being the behavioral radicals that they

are. the rugby players often find
' themselves left out of the official athletic
community at college. Here at Albany
State. the rugby team. when it gets a ﬁeld
at all. is bounced from field to ﬁeld, win-
ding up on the most remote and ill-kept
field available. This week, for a home
game against arch-rival Union. the team
had to nail up make-shif t goal posts on a
soccer practice ﬁeld. They shake off this
type of adversity. though. They sort of en-
joy being the rebels. the outsiders. The
NCAA doesn't recognize rugby as an in-
tercollegiate sport. but that's okay. (Any
ofﬁcial sanction would bring with it
restrictions. Much of the tradition would
be lost if the sport were institutionalized.
College rugby tests the body. the mind.
and the spirit. Whether the NCAA
recognizes it or not. rugby isthc sport that
gives the most honest portrayal of the mix-
ture of effort and enthusiasm that college
sport is supposed to be about. it is the
quintessentially collegiate sport.

mile distances were covered. The only
disadvantage to this was that the women:
couldn't use their times to qualify for the

- state meet. Nevertheless. "it wasgood

competition. it was so close.” said junior
Karen Kurthy. ‘

Pam Robinson and Anita Heath were
named outstanding competitors of the
meet. Robinson had both a seasonal best
and a personal best in both the javelin and
discus. as well as a win in the shot put.
Heath garnished the honors for her two sc-
cond places in the ZOO-meter run. and
400-meter run where she was “literally nip-
ped at the wire." She combined with team-
mates Lynellc Skeritt. Marcel innis and
Patti Barrett for a victory in the 400-meter
relay. As if that wasn't enough. Heath. in-
nis. Barrett. and sophomore Carol Bart
combined for a victory in the one mile
relay for 4:32.2. 

Bart had her work cut out for her. As a
result. she was chosen honorable mention
for her outstanding performancce in her
victory in the “JO-meter hurdles. fourth
place ﬁnish in the lOO-ynrd dash and
seasonal best long jump of 13" S'.~ .

"i went in thinking of it as an interval
work out more or less. it's hard to run
good times on a dirt track.” Bart added.
ironically. "i like 400-meter hurdles 'cause
it's painful. but if you can do it. it really
feels good." -.

Other honorable mention choices in-
cluded sophomore shotputtcr Leslie
Anderson. sophomore Barb Shiplcy.
junior Lynn Jacobs and the one. two.
three. four finish of Kim Pcttichord.
Karen Kurthy. Kitty Sullivan. and Maura
Mahon in the half mile run.

“After that i felt much more confident
in winning that meet. said distance coach
Ron White. “Up until that point we were: ;
little shaky." I

All In all. Coach White summed up the

meet by laying: ult WII'tﬂotni ‘tcil'h Vic-4'"

tory. Everyone pitched in and did their

share. That's what it takes in track and
field when there are 17 events."

He added: "The last event of the meet
was the mile relay. they hang together.
stuck together and didn't let it come apart
even though they knew we could probably
win without it."

The ﬁeld events staff contributed 21 out
of a possible 30 points according to ﬁeld
events coach Amy Kidder. Kidder said. “i
was really pleased today. Every person we
entered today placed. Alst') their hands
were cold in the wind. it was hard to hang

on. By the time they got to the javelin they

could hardly fill it."

“it's hard for major breakthroughs
because the season is so short. said Maura
Mahon. “Some of the field events people
practiced indoors. it's tough on com-
petitors psychologically with such little
time to practice."

Outstanding events include the two.
three placing of Robinson and Shipley in
the discus and their one. two placing in the
shot put. Lynn Jacob is second place in the
two mile run and junior Karen Kurthy's in
the three mile run.

tough play by all the doubles' teams.
Playing first doubles. Debbie Leffe and
Betsy Aronin had a difﬁcult match. but
showed confidence in winning 6-3. 7-6.

“We had a very competitive match.
we went into the dottbles matches hav-

Albany netwomen defeat
Manhattanville by 6-3

“We're not in our best forth. but cort-
sidering that we’re out of shape we did
fairly well." said Debbie Leffe. “it took
us a long time to warm up and the sur-
face that we played on was hard. mak-
ing it tough to play on."

This past Wednesday. Albany hosted
Vassar for their first home match and
were unsuccessful.

Vassar. ranked highly in the N.Y.
State Polls. dismantled the overmatched
Danes.

“Honestly. they're a great team and
we're just rtot up to par." stated Leffe.

The women lost a lot of key points.
including many tlebrcakers. According
to coach Jim Serballk. the team needs to
be more consistent in that area.

“We held our own. bttt we're not
polished enough to grab those impor-

tant points." added team captain chfe.
