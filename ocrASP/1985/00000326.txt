Danes havingtrouble finding pieces inﬁdark

By Jeff Mallaber
‘I \II llKIIIR

Albany State baseball Coach
i-Itl Zuloom has the same probletn
that a lot of fathers of young
children have on Christmas Day.
He has all the pieces but he just
can't pttt them together.

This year. when the Danes have
gotten good pitching. the offense
has faltered. When the offense
has been there. the pitching has
collapsed.

Wednesday's double header
against RP] offered ample
evidence of Zztloom‘s problems.
The Danes came away with a loss
and a tie on a day wltett they pro-
duced 17 hits and I6 rttns. Some
days. you jttst can't buy a break.

In the first game. with captain
Chris Fletcher on tlte mound. the
Danes looked like they were in
good shape. They started off with
two runs in the bottom of tile first
inning to take a 2-0 lend. Fletcher
gave up two runs to the Engineers
in the second inning and the
Danes cante back with another
run to take the lead. 3-2. That was
when the walls started to come
down around (‘oach laloom‘s
struggling Danes.

The Engineers scored one run
apiece in the third. fourth. and
fifth innings, to take a 5-3 lead. lf
ours were a perfect world, this is

not. however. a perfect world..

and the bats did not come alive.
The Danes struggled scorelessly
throttgh the fourth. fifth and
sixth innings. The datn broke in
the last inning. The Engineers
came through with three runs to
make the score 8-3, putting the

game out of reach. The Danes
tallied a meaningless run in their
half of the inning to make the
final score 8-4. Fletcher got the
loss. despite a decent
pcrfonnance.

. Couch Zalootn took the defeat
in stride. When risked yesterday.
he said, "The game was a heck of
a lot closer than the final score.
We just came up short in a couple
of key situations."

Game two got out of hand very

sive slugfest. Bob Tobias started
for the Danes and let up 8 runs on

it was unfortunate for the Albany State
lacrosse team that their game against the Univer-
sity of Vermont was on Tuesday instead of

“Our two best games to date have been on
Saturdays." said head coach Rick Flanders.
“Against Vermont. we definitely did not play
like we did last Saturday against Geneseo."

Tuesday's game against Vermont resulted in a
dismal 20-5 loss for the Dane stickmcn, lowering

“We played the same way we played the Union
game," said Flanders. “We started okay, but we
gave up easy goals and pressed too hard. The
score jumped from 4-] to 9~2 very quickly."

Vermont was on the scoreboard first. scoring
four minutes into the start of the first quarter.

Weekday jinx continues for stickmen

Dane attackmcn Dave Cerny, assisted by senior
Rick Trizano. evened the game with a goal scored
two minutes later.

The lie was broken minutes later. as Vermont's
offense exploded for five goals. making it 6-1.
Cerny. assisted by Jim Mcl’artlin. scored once
again for the Danes to bring the score to 6-2 at
the end of the quarter.

Vermont again began the scoring in the second
quarter. scoring twice before McPartlin. assisted
by Gary Werner. closed the gap somewhat with a
goal to make it 8-3. That would be the only goal
the Danes would score in the quarter. however.

two innings. Coach Zaloom was
disapointed by Tobias' perfor-
mance. “He‘s got to do a better
job for us than he has been. He's
got to get todgh. keep the ball
lower, and get it done.” were his
comments.

The rest of game two was a sac-
saw affair of the Danes battling
back and RP] retaking the lead.
When all the hitting and running
finally stopped the score_ was
l2-l2 and that‘s how it went
down in the books. Bob Martilla
and Fred Saccocio were the of fen-
sive stars with two hits each. Mar-
tilla also walked three times and
hit a two run homer.

Obviously. the Danes are disap-
pointed when they muster up 10

hits and 12 runs and can't win.
Saeeocio had this to say, “it was
a frustrating game. We can't seem
to put together the good hitting
and good pitching in one game;
The good thing is that we fought
back as a team." , 
Coach Zaloom sees prospects
for a brighter future. He said,
“We just haven’t put
together yet. The kids are playing
hard. You can’t blast them. We
just have to keep plugging".

The Danes will keep plugging. 

They have a 5-8-l record with a
3-3 mark in their conference.
They will host Colgate tomorrow
and LeMoyne in a twinbill on
Sunday. Both teams are Division

Albany crew sweeps four
from Hamilton in debut

In their first rowing competi-
tion on water, the Albany State
crew team looked nothing like
first-timers.

Last Saturday. the Dane rowers
swept four races from Hamilton

the Hudson River located near the
port of Albany. For most of the
Albany crew members. it wasn't
just the first time they rowed for
Albany, but it was their ﬁrst race.

“We just wanted to row the
best race we possibly could." said
oarswoman Jennifer Hanson.
“Beating Hamilton was secong
-dary. It was just a bonus."

A rather hefty bonus as it turn-
ed out. The Danes shut out
Hamilton. winning the two
women‘s races and the two men’s
races.

“I was expecting us to win."
said coach Jeff Sehaeffer. "But,
it was their first race. so they
didn't know what to expect."

In the first women‘s race. the

“We were all very nervous,”
said coxswain Kaye. “But we
hung in there after that bad

superlative efforts. They were
