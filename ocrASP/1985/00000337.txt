TOM HAN KS

Makes New Waves

didn‘t set out to be an actor,"
claims Tom Hanks. But the

curly haired 28-year-old star

of two of last year's biggest

hits, Splash and Bachelor
Party, will impact America's
movie screens again this
summer with a double shot of
comedy — Volunteers (with John
Candy) and The Man Will; One
Red Shoe (with Lori Singer).
Adaptable, intense. a casually
good-looking version of Every-
man, Hanks has zoomed in four
years from minor Shakespearean
touring company roles, leapfrog-
ging TV in a single bound, and
landed in the front ranks of leading
men. in his ofﬂtand-yet-energetic

'way, Hanks has achieved what he didn't

set out to do.

In thoroughly faded Levi's, a green
plaid wool shirt over a green t-shirt and
red-laced hiking boots, Hanks greets me
at the door of his let floor room at
the brand new and ridiculously tasteful,
48-shades-of—plum Sheraton Premiere
Hotel, overlooking the expanses of Uni-
versal Studios. Downstairs. a harpist was
plucking "Don‘t Cry for Me, Argentina"
to late breakfasters. But things are even
funnier in Hanks“ room.

“I wish you coulda been here a while
ago," he says, trying to look serious.
"They had all these explosions anti stuff
going off on theA Team set. It was very
lifelike. Just like TbeA Team. "

The phone suddenly iangles and it‘s
Richard Benjamin, the actor/director
who did Racing will) the Moon and My
Favorite War, and who will direct
Httnks' next film. The Money Pit.

"Oh, absolutely," says Hanks, chewing
over co-star possibilities. “I think that'd
begreatl Sh ' very funny."

Tom Hanks grew up all around the
San Francisco Bay Area. His father, a

chef, took :1 succession of jobs that
led the family from San Mateo to
Alameda, to Oakland, back to
Alameda and so on. Hanks fit in
by being the classroom goof, but
he played the role with charm.

"i could disrupt the class as
well as the worst thug, but i
never got in trouble," he says,

waving a hand. Hc's settled into :1
short, two-person sofa. He folds
and unfolds hi ns, arcs his thick,

black eyebrows and creates a furrow be-
tween them as the various questions
pass by. He tends to answer with such
enthusiasm that he's compelled, five to
seven twists of thought later, to ask,
“Did that answer the question? What was
the question. anyway?"

Hanks chose Cal State University at
Sacramento because it would allow him
to cram his schedule with electives in
Theater. "The people in Dramatic Arts
were funny," he says, explaining his
choice of major. “The people in Me-
chanical Drawing weren't funny. I sort of
gravitated to my own. I wanted to be a
stage manager. I did stage carpentry, I
wired the lights. I just wanted to have a
hand in the whole thing. I was only in
college for real for about a year. Before
that, l was just in college because as long
as you were in school, you didn't have
to be working. Then, when these pet»
pie said, ‘Do you wanna do this job,‘ i
said ‘Yes.’ "

The job was with the Great Lakes
Shakespeare Festival. Hanks played at
least 18 different parts, including Cassio
in O/bello and Proteus in Two Gen/le-
men of Verona, over a span of three
years. "It was the best training of all," he
says. "You learn because you're watch—
ing all these experienced actors play
the leads. And the electricity and chem-
istry coming out of an ensemble is the
greatest thing about acting."

Hanks fell for an act 55 he met dur~
ing this period, and they're now mar»
ried, with two children and a home, cur-
rently being remodeled, very close to
the hotel. Hanks is just back from
Mexico, where much of Volunteers was
shot, doing some ﬁnish-11p work at the
Universal lot. His character, Lawrence
Bourne III, is a Yalic who is “insouciant
as hell, he tak 9 life on his own terms,"
until he's for d to flee the country as
11 Peace Corps Volunteer because his
upper-crust father won't pay his gam-
bling debts. in Thailand, Hanks wrangles
with John Candy over building a bridge
across a treacherous river to a primitive
village. it develops that the CIA, drug
traffickers and Communist guurillas are
all sccrctly behind the bridge-building
scheme, and Hanks and Candy must join
forces. Much of the film was shot around
'l‘uxtcpcc. near the mountainous border
between the states of Oaxaca and Vera-
cruz, in terrain similar to that of South—

east Asia.

The CIA also ﬁgures in The Man mil/J
Om: Red Shoe, wherein Hanks teams
with Lori Singer (currently in 7719 Falcon
and the Snowman) against the machina-
tions of veteran character actors Charles
Durning and Dabney Coleman. it's an
adaptation of a French farce of the x-
tics entitled The Tall Blond Man will:
One Black Shoe, a story of mistaken
identity. Though he's an innocent by-
stander, when the CIA puts Hanks under
surveillance, suddenly every move he
makes seems suspicious. “it‘s almost a
battle of wills, though my character
doesn't know the battle is going on,"
Hanks says. “He's pretty much oblivious
until there are only two minutes left in
the movie. i told Stan [Dragoti, the ﬁlm's
director] that i feel it's about the rape of
this man‘s privacy. for essentially no rea-
son at all.“

Hanks" connecting link to films from
Shakespeare was a 1980 TV series called
Boson: Buddies. It didn‘t draw strong rat-
ings, but has recently been dusted off
and put back on the air 'tgain. T 5 says
more about the increased drawing
power of Tom Hanks than it does about
the cleverness of the show itself. “I mus~
tered about as much goofiness as i
could,“ Hanks has told reporters of his
Iiosom Buddies stint.

Finally, what does Hanks want to do
with the rest of his accelerating career?
“The guy in Red Shoe is :1 regular guy in
what he thinks ‘ 1 regular world," re-
ﬂects Hanks. “He‘s just an average Joe.
That's the kind of thing i‘m drawn to,"
There's a distinct furrowing of the brow
as he tries to swiftly psulate several
thoughts about acting, meaningfulnc
fun and life's enduring value \V’
like to see in movies in play, .
gt‘ec of wit. it's a pi‘L‘UOUS commodity. i
always try to get as much of that into a
performance  '
true to the c aucr. i have :1 theory ti I
all the great wo s of literature are \’L ;
witty." iianks pitches forward, moc
himself with :1 little smile but speaking
in earnest “NougIlmu/vl is :1 jinn/y play.
The same for Richard [bu Third, or
Che" 1v. I'm not talking about comedy,

i'm talking about wit. No matter

. going on, no matter how grim it

may be, there is an opportunity to bring

it down to :1 human lcvcl. i think i can
bring Ibal to a pan."
