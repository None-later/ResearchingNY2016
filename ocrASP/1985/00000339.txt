A report released last week
from New - York State Com-
ptroller Edward Regan's office
gave SUNY Albany ﬂying colors
in energy conservation for the
1983v84 fiscal year.

An audit. administered by the
Comptroller‘s office was done on
a total of ten SUNY campuses in-
cluding Binghamton. Buffalo.
Amherst and Oneida. as well as
the SUNY Central Administra-
tion. Questionnaires were also
sent to 35 SUNY campuses in
order to obtain data on campus
energy policies. said a spokesper-
son front the Comptroller's of»
flee. Karen Collen.

“Visits made to 'SUNY cam~
puses across the state revealed
energy consumption levels which
were not in compliance with stan-
dards previously established by
SUNY in I974." saldCollen,

time." Abelow agreed.

Abelow cited his tow years
experience working with
Gawley on the Student Action
Committee as evidence that
they will make an effective
team. They have worked on
such issues as the 2| year old
drinking age. federal financial
aid cuts and voter registration.
Abelow noted.

Abelow said he was pleased
with Thomas' decisoin to
withdraw. “i think it was very
professional of Chris to con-
cede." he said. referring to the
fact that Thomas received less
than ltalf as many votes as he
did.

“it gives me an extra week to
start learning the intracacies of
the office," Abelow added.

Noting the differences in thc

' vote totals in the first election.
Abelow said. "l’m sure that i
would have won in the run-off
election."

Thomas conceded that it
would have been “difficult”
for Abelow to have received a
majority on the first ballot
since there were five candidates
running for the ofﬁce.

Thomas. however. did feel'
that it was fair to require the
Tun-off. “i think that a majorlv

~ ty of students should approve
of .who's running their student
government." '

Saying he felt his chances in
a run-off would have been
“pretty good." Thomas add-
‘ed. “1 would have had to run a
negative campaign. however.
and i don't think that’s worthy
of a student campaign."

Both candidates felt the cam-
paign went smoothly. “it was a
race on merit rather than'a
negative campaign." Thomas
said. “i have a good relation-
ship with Ross." he continﬂ‘eg.

Press news release. auditors
found that 34 percent of rooms
tested throughout the state were
heated to warmer temperatures
than the 68 degree standard set by
SUNY. The audir also found 35
percent of rooms examined were

Apparently suclt violations
were not found here on the
Albatty campus. "This campus
was one singled out as the only
University in the system which
completed a full audit." said
Dennis Stevens. Vice President

ed with the results." The Univer-
5in was. in fact. praised for effec-

record proves

easy game for 5,060 players

By Matt Gaven
STAFF WRITER '

it took most of the afternoon under a blazing
sun. but by 5 pm Satttrday. 5060 members of
SUNYA had broken the world's record for the
largest musical chairs game ever held.

The previous record of 45l4. held by Ohio State
University. was shattered by SUNYA which added
-over 500 participants tothe record.

The 4 hour and 35 minute game was won by Peter
Seirafi a junior at SUNYA majoring in biology.

fi could not be found for several minutes
after his victory. He had left his official registration
number in his car and thought he would be dis-
qualified if he wasn't wearing it. He appeared a
short time later at the judge's tent with a police
escort that ushered him from the crowded playing
.field.

I can‘t believe this. I'm happy enough that we
broke the record. 1 really didn't expect to win.”
said Seirafi. "I wasn‘t supposed to come today
because}! have my MCATS next week. i should be
studying right now."

-“l wasn't really sure about playing. but i figured
what could i lose for sticking around a little while."
said Scirafi. who plans to take a rest from the world
‘record Vcircuit for some time.

The game lasted two hours longer than the
organizers had predicted. The 5060 participants
moved through the course of 50.000 chairs like a
snake slithering its way across a lawn.

The cltairs were set up in I4 individual rows
which formed a series of “S” shape formations.
After the first round of music. to percent of the
chairs were removed. which continued until there
were too chairs left. At that point. two hours after

the game started. the chairs were removed one at a .

time after each break in the music.

When the final round commenced. there was one
chair left with two contestants looking for a seat.
The single chair was centered in a square area set up
with four Miller Beer plastic cups. The two con-
testants walked around the cups until the music
stopped and one was left standing.

Seirafl's final opponent was Dan Rise. who just

sat on the ground exhausted while the crowd mobb-
ed Scirafi after he took a winning seat.

_ "After setting up the chairs all day yesterday(Fri-
day) in the rain. i started becoming pessimistic as to
whether we'd actually make it through today." said
lvan Shore. Guinness Day chair. “When we started
to register the hundredds of people that showed up
early. it was then that my attitude began to change.
The real clincher was when the sun came ut. that
really made the day complete. We couldn‘t have
asked for better weather."

According to Shore. who slept in his car all night
watching the ears to prevent vandalism. "i know it
sounds a bit corny. but this is really a dream come
true. We've come along way from the initial plann-
ing stages last September."

“We broke the record by a considrable amount
when you compare SUNYA to Ohio State and see
that we are about a third of their size." said co-
chair Patty Salkin, who is also SA Programming
Director. “All the records aside. nty greatest titriil
was hearing the people chant
ALBANY...ALBANY during the Pepsi-Wave."

The Pepsi-Wave. the first of its kind, was held
before the game began while the 5060 participants
were sitting in their chairs. The wave was initiated
by Uttivcrsity President Vincent O'Leary attd took
about 7 and a half minutes to complete.

“Like all other participants. i really enjoyed
myself. A day like this is important in the college
environment. it gives everyone a chance to relax

‘and jttst have fun." said O'Lcary. who was one of

several administrators on hand for the event.

Othcr university officials who participated in-
cluded Academic Affairs Vice-President Judith
Ramalcy and Student Affairs Vice-President Dr.
Frank Pogue. who managed to get through the first
nine rounds of the game.

“The event attracted quite a bit of attention from
the local press. in addition to some national ex-
posure." according to Salkin. “All three local
television stations were here. including reporters
from the Times Union. Knickerbocker News.
Schenectady Gazette. Troy Record. and People
