Gay and Lesbian‘ﬁwareness Week kick-
ed off Monday night witha keynote ad-
dress by Peter Drago and Virginia Apuzzo.
two prominent advocates of gay and les-
bian civil rights.

About 25 people attended the lectures
held. tn the Assembly Hall. .which was
the Gay and. Lesbian
Alliance and the Lesbian and Gay Center.

Drago. Governor Cuomo's iiason to the
gay and lesbian community. said he was
“saddened to see such a small turnout"
and emphasized that “until we (the gay
and lesbian community) are willing to
come out and help ourselves we can’t ex-
pect other people to do so."

He noted that with a lesbian and gay
civil rights bill under discussion in the New
York State Legislature. that “if anything’s
going to happen this year...tomorrow’s
when those realities will be dealt with.”

Although Drago said “we have a gover-
nor who supports us." he added that
Governor Cuomo has exhausted the things
ire can do. “We've gone as far as we can
under present laws."

Cuomo's Executive order number 28
(the Human Rights Law) that was cir-
cuiated in l982 called for an end to
discrimination based on sexual orientation
in state jobs. Drago said but the order “is
good only as long as he‘s (Cuomo) in
power."

“This bill won't solve all our pro-
blems." Drago asserted, “but people’ will
have more trouble discriminating with this
legislation in effect." '

“We haven’t been heard in large enough
numbers." Drago said. To be effective
“we've got to organize better throughout
the state."

“Gay pride" is fast becoming “gay
smug" according to Apuzzo. ex-Executive
Director of the National Gay Task Force.
“Just because we are discriminated against'
does not mean we won’t discriminate
against others." she said.

“Every group that's been at the bottom
of the ladder and moved up has taken on
the role of oppressor to the next group."
Apuzzo said pointing out that a group as
diverse as the gay and lesbian community
should be able to put a stop to this process.

She emphasized that a successful gay
and lesbian movement must also be con-
cerned with issues such as the defense

Politics and political power are a must for gay and lesbian movement.

budget and the womens’ equal rights
movement.

“The extraordinary responsibility on
our part is to recognize the generic issue of
oppression." she said. "How can we stand
by and not address with equal vigor" those
other vital concerns?

Apuzzo added that "even if we got a gay
rights bill in America tomorrow we‘d still
have to deal with" these other problems.
“We‘d continue to live the reality of op-
pression." she said.

"The context for this (gay and lesbian)
movement has not been for a piece of
legislation, even though we desperately
need it. it's the notion of social change."
Apuzzo asserted. .

“The bill is desperately needed. but a lot
of other bills are also desperately needed."
she said adding. “if the purpose (of the
movement) was just to pass this bill i
would have wasted the last decade or so of
my life."

The problem of the gay and lesbian
movement. according to Apuzzo. is one of
a failure to identify goals and make com-
mitments. She identiﬁed two fundamental
strategies necessary for the movement's
ultimate success. “Politics and political
power is a must." Apuzzo said adding that
education is even more needed. “if you
want to stop a movement. prey on ig-
norance." said Apuzzo.

~“it’s easier to allow destruction and
pain when you are labelled” she said. “We
have to demonstrate that we are people
and we can't allow our dignity to be infr-
inged upon."

“We owe something to the next genera"-
tion of gays and lesbians,...and straight
people." Apuzzo said. to not “sell
ourselves and our community short."

She added. however. that the struggle
involves pain. endurance and a long-term
commitment. “it's not a sprint. it‘s a
marathon." L]

Thousands protest Reagan’s policies

By Beth Finneran
STAFF WRITER .
Thousands of demonstrators. including
approximatel;y a dozen SUNYA students
and 150 members of the Albany communi-
ty marched and rallied at the United States
Capitol in Washington Saturday to protest
the Reagan Administration’s policies on
Central America. South Africa. the
Nuclear Arms race. and the military
budget.

The protest. which was organized by a
nationwide coalition called “April Actions
for Peace. Jobs. and Justice." was the
largest rally opposing Reagan's policies‘ih
his second term according to the
Washington Post.

The demonstration. which followed a
rally Friday night. concluded with
speeches by Reverend Jesse Jaskson. Rep.
John Conyers. and others. and culminated
with a sit-in blocking entrances to the
White House. Lobbying also took place on
Monday. 1

Students and many other groups march-
‘ed. chanted. and carried signs. with
slogans such as “You can't hug your
children nuclear arms." '

One demonstrator chained a 50 pound.
l4 foot fiberglass copy of a Pershing ll
missile on his back to emphasize the
nuclear threat and to symbolize “the
economic burden of the arms race."

“We must end the contradictions of
funding the ‘Contras.' trading with South
Africa. honoring the Nazis and reuniting
with the legacy of fascism." Jackson told
the crowd of about 45.000.

“This is a period of darkness and
madness. but- there are still signs of life."
he said.

Jackson applauded the studehts‘ protest
againstﬁouth Africa at Columbia Univer-

‘ sity saying. “They're moving away from

Yuppyism and moving toward sharing and
caring.“

Conycrs. who spoke after Jackson. said.
“This is a turning point in iristory...a
united people cannot be divided." he add-
ed, “Reagan is undermining national
security with his insane budget."

Other speakers included Sergio Samicn-
to of the National Union of Nicaraguan
Unlvcsity Students. who thanked the
American people for the interest “in peace
and non-intervention in Nicaragua."

Adrian Wilson. who now works in
Albany but two years ago lived in
England.‘said he was particularly impress-
ed with the broad support of many groups
at the rally. “i think the general feeling is
that the American public docs think
there's going to be a war instead of realiz-
ing that it's going on right now...that's
why they have to start protesting." Wilson

said.“Amcrica is already in those coun-
tries.“ Wilson continued. recalling Viet
Nam. “The longer it goes on the harder it
is to turn around." he said. “We've learn-
ed through the 60's that if you do
demonstrate enough you can change
government policy." Wilson added.

“Money for tuition. not ammunition."
was one of the many chants voiced. Laura
Latendre. one of the SUNYA students that
attended said. “it was good to show the
President that there is opposition to his
policies."

“This is a start. we need to gain strength
as we call for changes in domestic and
foreign policy." Latendrc added.

Julia Steinbcrg. a senior who is major-
ing in Latin American studies. said she was
inspired by the event. “Every time people
go out in the streets it does have an impact
both for the people who didn't go and for
the government." Steinberg said.

“One of the strengths of this marcit was
that it got so many people working
together on different issues." she said. ad-
ding thrtt she hopes now people will begin
to realize that “Our government policy as
a whole is going in the wrong direction."

“This march should be an inspiration to
those of us who did go. to continue the
work on campus and lnvlve the communl~

Cl

' ty." Steinbcrg concluded.

Bodyfound
not Wilson’s; .
investigation .
to continue

By Doug Tuttle
31er warren

Efforts by University Police to look
into the possibility that the body of a
woman found _this past weekend
floating in the Delaware River near
Trenton. New Jersey could have been
Karen Wilson’s. determined conclusive—
ly that the body was not in fact Wilson's
according to SUNYA Director of Public
Safety Jim Williams.

Discrepancies in clothing, jewelry.
and body weight proved that the body
wasn't that of Wilson. An autopsy on
the body was to have been performed
Monday morning. Williams said.

University Police became aware of the
discovered body. according to Williams.
through routine nationwide police
communication.

Williams wouldn't comment on the
number of investigators still on the case.
except to say that it depended on the
number of leads. “if there was
something to do. we could have 50
detectives here in half an hour,“ ire said.

“The case is not going to be closed
until it is resolved,“ Williams asserted.

Williams said he had “no idea”
whether Wilson. missing since March
27. could still be in the Albany area, ad-
ding. "l don't speculate in the press.”

Williams did say. however. that there
was “definitely f ul play" involved
because. he said. “From what we know
about the character of Miss Wilson. she
would never willingly get in a car with a
stranger." He added. "She didn't run
away."

According to Doug Lanker. a friend
of Wilson’s, Wilson's parents and
friends have been in constant contact
with police since Wilson's
disappearance.

No more student searches have been
planned because. Lanker said. “Almost
every area in Albany that can be search-
cd has been searched." Wilson’s friends
have informed police that they are
available to do whatever is needed.
Lanker said.

Residents of Seneca Hall on lndian
Quad have also helped out. donating
$100 to help cover any private expenses
that might be incurred trying to ﬁnd
Wilson. according to Beth Stevens. the
R.A. in that hall.

Wilson is believed to have been last
seen walking south on Fuller Road
towards Washington Avenue on March
27.

Wilson is about 5'3" tall. She weighs
“5 pounds and has light sandy brown
hair and light brown eyes. On the night
of her disappearance. she is believed to
have been wearing blue jeans. a blue

- short sleeved shirt. a white rain coat.
and white tennis shoes. it is possible that
she was wearing large rimmed glasses.

Anyone who may have any informa-
tion is urged to contact the SUNYA

Public Safety Department at 457-7770.
