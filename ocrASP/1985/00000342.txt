“The weekend gives the students
a chance to see what the universi-
ty is like. and to experience a part
of dorm life."

The students arrived from New
York City at the campus around
12 pm. Saturday. and ate linch
on Dutch Quad. After lunch they
were given a tour of the campus.
which ended in LC6 to hear
SUNYA administrators and
minority group leaders speak on
the advantages which SUNYA of~
fcrs minority students.

“We need to have more blacks
and minority students at
SUNYA," said _Pogue. adding
that he felt “Albany has quality
programs to pffer.” He said. "A
number of high school students

Albany first." ~

Other speakers ‘.included

tion. and the Pan Caribbean
Association. James Wessman. of
the Department of Latin
American and Caribbean Studies.
and Lester Brown. of the School
of Social Welfare. addressed the
students on the importance of
recruiting minorities into their
programs. “Social Welfare ma-
jors used to be largely white and
female." said Brown. “Now 60
percent of the majors are male,
black. hispanic. or Asian." he
said. adding that “things are
beginning to change on the
campus."

 

A counseIOr from the Educa-
tional Opportunities Program
(EOP) discussed the program and
encouraged students to take ad-
vantage of the‘six-week summer
program which EOP offers to'
provide students with instruc-
tional help in certain educational
areas. such as writing skills and
math. before their entrance into
the university. ‘

Dwayne sampsonpco-Chair of
the Minority Task Force and an

taken advantage of 'the summer
program." a‘ddng that after he
enrolled at the university he

Most of the students saidthey
considered the trip very wor-

ingtheir selection of a college. ;
Donna Bennett. 8 high school
senior from Queens. gave her im-

pression of the school as “Huge. - '

but very nice” adding that she
definitely wanted to come here
next year. “1 originally wanted to
go to St. John‘s,” she said, "but
after seeing this, i’ve changed my
mind."

“Seeing the campus has really
helped to make up my mind."
said another student. “Albany

Univ. seeks AT+ T stock

in unusual

By Christopher Brady

in a unique and creative at-
tempt to obtain charitable ‘dona-
tions to the university. SUNY is
asking parents and alumni to
donate stock in American'
Telephone and Telegraph
‘(AT&T) and any of the Bell
Operating Companies to the
school.

“When the AT&T break-up oc~
lcurred. many people who owned
small or modest amounts of stock
were left with ‘odd lots' of stock
from the Bell Operating Com~
Vpanics." explained, Sorrell
‘Chesin. Associate Vice President
for University Affiars. “They
found that any profit that could
_be realized by selling the shares
would be eaten up by brokers'
commissions."

“So the university' is ‘asking
that they donate their odd shares
to the university and then get'the
full value of the stocks by .way of
a tax credit.” he said.

‘ “Donations come to the

‘ university in many forms." said

; Chesin. “Cash and money willed

; in estates are the most popular

‘ forms. What we are trying to do is

I give people another option in how
they can donate."

When AT&T broke up people
~_who owned small numbers of
_shsrcs were given a. divested stock
package, according to Chesin.
“In essence, for every one share
of ATdc'l‘ that they had they were
given back one share of AT&T

,stock. which was greatly reduced

in value.'nnd one share each in
reach of the newly formed Bell
lOpcrating Companies." he
‘ explained.

 

 

 

 

fund-raiser

AT&T stock dropped from an
approximate value of $65 to
around $20 and the balance value
was made up of shares in the new
companies. Chesin said. When an
owner attempts to sell their shares
they must pay broker fees. which
take away from any profit
realized.

However. Chesin said. if they

donate their shares to the univer- “

sity they can deduct the full value
of the stock from their taxes as a
charitable donation. V

“if the response is good‘and
the university gets a good amount
of shares. we will be able to turn
around and sell a ‘rofrnd lot‘ of
100 shares and be 'tible to get a
better price per share on the
broker’s commission." Chesin
said. “ ‘

The money that is donated
through this program or any
other. is’ used for many things
that “just wouldn't be covered
under normal operating expen-
ditures." Chesin said. adding that
“World Week was mainly under-
written by privatc money.”

“Private money is also used for

scholarship funds. Library funds.
it assists in funding the different
departments and a host of other
academic and alumni programs."
he said. “Donations may make
the difference between getting a
good education and a top quality
education." he added.

“1 encourage students to bring
the program to the attention of
their parents or any other in«
terested donors as it is beneﬁcial
to both the school and the
donor." Chesin said. [J

ference in the Campus Center

After the conference. Albany

President Vincent O‘Leary and
other community and-campus
leaders went down to the Pine
Hills area~ to help in a
neighborhood clean up.

Howard Sonnenschein, Presi-

was an‘ idea coming from the
'whole fraternity in which they

could do one big thing that was.

“One of the best parts of the
whole week was when all the
children came out and thanked us
I for cleaning up so they could now

come outside and play." said Cancer Society.’

Sonnensehein.

"Also at Head Start. ZB’l‘ attempt to break the world's
record for playing the longest
softball game was held Friday
night. The attempt failed however
due to bad weather which. accor-

shame. since nobody was really

and other necessities" were set up
at the game in the event that they

New system helps fairly
allot Sr.» Week tickets,

By Alicia Cimlbora
NEWS EDITOR ‘

While most other students are
concerned with getting closed out
of their classes for next semester.
seniors are more worried about
getting closed out of the senior
week events they want to ‘par-
ticipatein. But. anew system of
ticket sales may prevent this from
happening. '

The new system of rotating the I

days and times that students with
senior cards will be allowed to
purchase tickets, according to
Class of '85 president Jeff
Schneider. was designed “so thast
everyone would be guaranteed to
get at least some of the more
popular events.” -

Tickets went on sale Sunday
and willcontinue to be available
to seniors with‘ senior cards
through Tuesday at 10 pm.

Last year. said Schneider.
seniors were assigned random
numbers from one to 3.000 which

i was “great if ‘you were number

one. but number 3.000 didn’t get
anything." 4‘

Another improvement in the
system allows for ,senior's with
earlier time slots to bring so-
meone else’s senior card and pur
chase tickets for those assigned to
later times on any day. {Nobody
will get all the events but
everybody will get some."
Schneider said. . =

“We're trying to give everyone
an equal shot." he said. explain-
ing that certain events such as the
Lake George Booze Cruise. the
Montreal overnight and the Met
game. which is a new event this

despite the problems that arise.
the community would suffer
without them. '

Chuck Newland. economic
development! director for the city
of Albany. agreed that the
students are a vital part of the
community. “The mayor
(Thomas Whalen) is looking to
enhance the level of cooperation
between both groups. the

 

year. are expected to sell out
quickly. _

in order to accomodate as
many seniors as possible. more
seats are available on each trip
and more trips are being offered
than last year. Schneider said. in;

' eluding each of the canoeing and
the booze cruise.

“We don’t want to See seniors
get closed out of even ts." he said.
adding that many trips are being
offered on the same days to
facilitate an even distribution of
tickets to preferred events.

Schneider also stressed that on-
ly seniors with senior cards will be
able to buy tickets at senior class
prices. Only about half of the
senior class has senior cards, he

. added. ' -

A new event being featured in
senior week this year ‘will be
Senior Fest which Schneider

‘ described as a "minivMayfest." it
will be held after ﬁnals week and
although it is geared more
specifically to seniors. it will be

: free and open to everyone. he
said. Featured at Senior Fest will
be the Newports-
Stomplistics. and Johnny Rabb
and the. Jailhouse Rockers. The
event will be co-cponsored by the
senior class and Miller beer.

Other events offered during
Senior week include the clam-
bake. Jai Alai. Great Adventure.
Boston day trips. a Broadway
show and senior night at the

seniors with senior cards have
their chance. will be made

However. according to Lee
Lindstrom. a member of the Task
Force. the whole issue is left for
the legislature. "The shoe drops
on the legislature." she said.
“The university is willing to put.
up additional housing downtown.
the money was just not allotted. '
