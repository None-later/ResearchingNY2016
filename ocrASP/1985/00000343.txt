At least once every minute someone in
this country attempts or completes a
suicide. Suicide is the second most com-
mon cause of death among l5-24 year
olds, and the fourth leading cause of death
among the elderly. it’s a problem which
affects millions: those who threaten. at-

families and friends. 

Suicide can be very
frightening and hard to
understand for most of 
us. but in many cases, suicide is
preventable. ' .

There are‘a number of myths about
suicide:

.Myth: A person who talks about suicide
will not commit it.

Myth: Suicide happens without
warning.

Myth: Suicide is always the act of so-
meone who is mentally ill.

Myth: Once a person is suicidal, he or
she is suicidal forever.

upon dying. _ .
Myth: improvement following a crisis
ends the risk of suicide. \

Myth: Talking with a person about their
suicidal ideas will encourage them to ac-
tually make an attempt.

The facts of suicide are actually very dif-
ferent. Eight out of ten people who have
committed suicide talked about it
beforehand. Suicide is not a disease and is
not a permanent way of thinking. Often
suicides can follow a period of “improve-
ment.” Most suicidal people feel over-
whelmed by problems and feel they can no
longer cope with them. They may be ex~
periencing difficulty deciding between life

 

and death and want someone to save them.

Suiéidai notes indicate that although the
person was very unhappy. they weren't

mentally ill. Finally, talking with a person,

gbout their suicidal ideas will not put
thoughts of suicide into their heads.

A person's discussion of suicidal
thoughts or the cues they give are a
desperate form of communication. There
are many behavioral and verbal signs
which may indicate that a person is
seriously considering suicide. it is impor-
‘ tant to be aware of these cues if we are to
help the person who is suicidal.

Verbal cues are perhaps the most ob-
vious suicidal cues. Asuicidal person may
indicate a negative attitude toward life.

SUNYA protests prep

Several students are planning to give.
Lisa Birnbach. the author of “The Official
Preppy Handbook" and of statements
concerning SUNYA'S lack of school spirit
a less than warm greeting Wednesday night

{ when site will be the guest speaker at
I Russell Sage College‘s Senior Convocation
Ceremony, according to Patty Salkin. pro-
gramming director of SA.

We are planning to either stage a protest
at the airport when Ms. Birnbach arrives,
says Salkin. or to demonstrate outside
Russel Sage during hcre appearance.

Currently. adds Salkin. we are trying to
get the university to supply buses to
transport students to the protest sites.

Good art endures

Good on usually endures over time.
though some works have a hartlcr time of
it than others.

Ten years ago. SUNYA pucltased a
piece of art featuring the divsion of 3
dimensional space into geometrically in.-
tcrcsting units. The work. by then SUNYA
art department professor Alexander
Mackoff (now with Union College) was
originally placed in the entrance to a dorm,
but was removed after repeated collisions

suicide. as well as their 

Myth: Suicidal people are fully intent,

Suicide pre vention key-wis. : i  ;
recognizing warning signs '

themselves. or their future. These
statements might be: “i wish I were
dead," “I can't go on anymore." or
“Everyone would get along much better if
i weren’t here." Such cues should be taken
seriously as verbal requests for help. lfthe
person mentions more specific plans, such
as where, when or how he or she would
commit suicide. this may indicate that the
person is far along in the planning of such
an act. '

Reference to previous suicidal thoughts
or plans is another significant verbal cue.
Those who actually succeed in the act of
suicide are likely to have previously at-
tempted suicide. .

A second series of suicidal signs are the
area of behavioral changes. The most ob-
vious behaviors are related to eating. sleep-
ing and normal activity patterns. A sudden
inability to sleep. withdrawal from friends,
decreased activity and social interaction
level. irregular eating patterns, retreating
into the past, or an increase in sleeping
time, may indicate extreme depression
with a possible suicide threat.

An individual who begins to organize all
personal and business affairs may also be
in an initial stage of a suicidal plan.
Organization of this type might include
returning borrowed items. or the writing
of a will. During this stage, the suicidal'
person may appear deceptively calm. This
may ’occur because the individual has made
the decision to carry out the suicide plan.
Often. final statements are made to signfi-
cant others. In effect, the suicidal person is
saying goodbye. '

If someone is depressed and shows some.

type of change in behavior, this does not
automatically mean that the person is in
the midst of a suicidal crisis. However. if
there seems to be a constant pattern of
sleep loss. withdrawal. negative self:
statements, loss of appetite and personaiiJ
ty changes. a physician, dorm director.
counseling center. or private therapist
should be' contacted immediately.

suicide you may call the Middle Earth In-
formation Tape Li'ne at 457-5279 and re-
