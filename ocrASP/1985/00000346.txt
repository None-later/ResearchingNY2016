Shorrcrtplained that a lot of
the media attention was generated
by an article that appeared on the
front page. second section of the
Wall Street Journal.

Reporters from United Press
lnternational(UPl) and
Associated .Prcss(AP) were also
on . hand. according to Salkin.
.“Peter’s picture went out over the
news wires of UP! and AP. in ad-
dition'it will appear in the book
with Peter's name as the winner
of the‘ game." - . »
- ’Othch attempts at_ world
records were made Saturday also.
“Wc'tried to break the records
for hot-dog. hamburger. and
shrimp-eating." said Jon Har-
riéon. food contest coordinator
for Guinness Day. “No one really
came close to any of the records.
They're really ~ inhuman; we
should have realized this before.
but nobody seemed to object."

The event was co-sponsorcd by
SA. Pepsi. Miller Boer; University

 

Auxiliary Services. and WPYX. -
According to Salkin, “WPYX‘

traded as $3000 in advertising
time and the services of Mason
and Sheehan for so-sponsorship.
We couldn't turn down a deal like
that."

president, Rich Schafi'er. com-
menting on the event said. “this
proves to Lisa Blrnbach that.she
was wrong about SUNYA. it's
just one more activity of bringing
SUNYA together with its com-
munity. proving we are one of the
most spirited schools." Schat'fer
was referring to a book in which
author Lisa Blrnbach rated

SUN‘YA as tied for the lowest

school spirit among colleges in the
US. . '
According to Shore. "what
separates Guinness Day from

event. 1 think this accounts for
the level of participation and

cent represents a true.majori- '
ty." In this‘ case. however.
Light said. "i didn't think the
50 percent rule should have ap-
plied," adding. “it almost
guaranteed a run-off.”

Light said that a change in
the 50 percent rule might be
among the list of recommenda-
tions he will offer to Central
Council in the future.

"One solution might be that
the limit be lowered to 40 per-
‘cent if more than three can-
didates are running.” Light
suggested. '
