By Jlm Glenn .
The administration of the
University is extremely proud of
the fact that so many students
choose to attend ‘Albany State
because of its high academic stan-
dards and reputation. A fact they
may not be aware of, is that when
students tell
Mom and Dad
they want to
c o m e~t o '
Albany, it's  
because of the
variety of social alternatives
available. What student is going
to-"admit to their parents that the
real reason they want to come to
Albany, is because of its large and
“cl-IL.” lesbtian....an..d av

co‘ rse the Gay and Lesbian
A iance. of which the academic
year l985-86 will be the group's
fifteenth anniversary. As you
might expect. therehas always
been a certain amount of con-
troversy surrounding GALA.
Whether it is because of the in-
sistence that a statement of non-
discrimination for gay men and
lesbians be issued by the Universi-

SUNYA had continued to con-
sume energy at the same rate as it
did between I972 and l974, it
would have cost $11 million more
to supply the campus with suff-
cient energy than it does now.

The report on “the progra wide
audit," said Stevens, “is done
regularly by the department of
Correctional Systems and State
University systesm."

Although he received no
negative feedback- as a result of
the audit, Stevens said he would
like to see some improvements.
“We take energy conservation
very seriously here. We have a
very large campus and as a result
we continually have problems,"
he said.

“There are a lot of things I'd
like to do better.” Stevensnsaid.
One concern‘he noted is the in-
stallment of finer controls in the
dormitories. “Thermostats were
destroyed by residentsin, the past.
We've replaced 120 thermostats
in the dorms this year," he said.
“Because the heating of dorms is
zone controlled rathcr‘thaﬁ‘,
specifically controlled. -it is -dif-
ﬁcult to maintain comfortable
temperatures in each room." he
said.

“Students need much more in-
struction on how to control room
temperatures," said Stevens.
Although he has tried to work
with dorm directors on all the
quads. Stevens said he has found
it difficult to pass such informa-
tion on to students.

In order to maintain suitable
temperatures in the dormitories,
Stevens said he feels it is necessary
to educate students about their
own rooms as well as the effect of
the temperature in one room on
the temperature of another. “If a
roon is using 80 percent of its

ty, because we bring openly gay
speakers to campus, or because
we might be selling donuts in the
lobby” of .the campus Center.
Despite that, the group, recogniz-
:ed and funded by Student
Association. continues to offer

social, political and educational»

programs designed to highlight
and sensitize the diversity of the
University community. '
The group's willingness to
work in coalition with other
groups such as Feminist Alliance,
ASUBA, Middle Earth and
others, contributes to the quality
of campus life. How else would
the campus-population have an-
opportunity to hear such promi?

winner “The Times of Harvey
Milk" might never be shown.
That Harvey Milk, an openly gay
elected official in San Francisco
assassinated by another elected
official, was an alumnus of
Albany State, would remain an
obscure and buried fact.

“Our room was freezing all
winter. We had no heat," said
Dawn Falk. a freshman living on
State Quad.

“The temperature in my room
is very confortable." said An-
toniette Robinson, also a
freshman. “The LCs are veiy
warm when it gets warm outside
and I think they need some kind
of air circulation. I personally
find it difficult to stay awake dur-
ing some of my lectures."

“It‘s definitely very warm in
the Lecture Centers, and I have
trouble concentrating on the pro-
fessor’s lecture because I‘m either
fanning myself or falling

Karen Blake. I

In addition to other changes
implemented by Stevens he has
recently replaced street lighting

creased oil prices. According to
Collen. “energy conservation
measures are implemented where
they are deemed cost efficient and
where funding is available."

SUNY Central has reduced
energy usage by 26 percent on its
campuses across the state. saving
New York approximately Sl7l
million, over the past twelve
years.

SUNY's goal ws to establish
and moderate energy consump-
tion by reducing wattage and
making cost-effective recommen-
dations. D

The Task Force, according to
Swanstrom, has also looked into
other cities with similar problems

and the way that they have dealt

with them.

Lesbian and Gay activities and
projects are not restricted to
GALA. Through the efforts of
GALA and people at Middle
Earth, a grant of $5.000 from the
Chicago Resource Center was
awarded to the University to
establish the Lesbian and Gay
Center. Located in Middle Earth,

its major goal was to build further .'

coalition with other areas on cam-
pus to raise sensitivity of lesbian
and gay issues. This included up-
dating information already being
disseminated in course work, for-
mulating lesbain' and gay
coursework and generally respon-
r ding to the needs of the gay and
lesbian community on Campus.
The single most significant—and
visible accomplishment of the
Lesbian and Gay Center to date,
. hdifb‘éentlie formation and train-
- ing-of the Lambda Peers, a group
of gay and lesbian campus
volunteers. trained in basic listen-
ing skills and available to students
on a‘referral basis through Middle
Earth. Despite. the University's
decision not to continue funding
the Center. the Center board.
volunteers from student, ad-

ministration, and support staff,
will continue to meet. Ar-
rangements have also been made‘
to train additional Lambda Peers
for the 1985-86 academic year.

The one academic department
on campus that currently has a
mandate for the inclusion of les-
bian issues in its course work is
Women's Studies. They are to be

complimented on their sensitivity.

and it should be pointed out to
other'departments that Women's
Studies continues to be a strong
and respected resource on

. campus.

Lesbian and Gay life is not
restricted to campus either. In ad-

dition to its varietyof bars‘and'

clubs catering to gay people,
Albany has its own Lesbian and

City Community Center on Hud-

son Avenue. It is one of the few
organizations in the nation to be
housed in the building that it
owns. Space is set aside for
various meetings and functions as
well as a nightly coffee house
from 7 to II pm. In addition. the
building rents space to the AIDS
Council of Northeastern New

 Gay activismaots as a campus recruiting tool

York and the New York State
Lesbian and Gay Lobby. It
publishes a directory of services
listing over 40 organizations
locally serving the social,
religious, educational, and.
political needs of the Capital
District gay and lesbian com-
munity. Further information can
be obtained by calling the Com-
munity Center any evening bet-
ween 7 and ii pm. at 462-6l38.

As GALA and the other
organizations on campus con-
tinue to work with the outside
community, the University.will
continue to be a place to celebrate
diversity. Many former students
become involved in the larger

' community, Occupying leadel‘sh‘ip
positions and acting as positive.

role models. You are welcome to
celebrate that diversity with us.

GALA meets every Tuesday

evening at 8:30 pm. in the Cam-
pus Center throughout the
ncadcmic year. Their ofﬁce is
located in room 333 in the Cam-
pus Ccntcr next to the ASP and
the phone number is currently
