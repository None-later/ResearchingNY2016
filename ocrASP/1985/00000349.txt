“It was ‘well worth the trip." com-

didn't mean Dunkln' Donunts. He was‘

speaking in reference to the many outstan-
ding performances at the ' Binghamton
track last Saturday. Binghamton scored 92"
points while Albany and Union trailed
behind with scores of 63 and 27
respectively. '

Freshman Marcel Innis was named
outstanding competitor of the meet for her
victories in the 100 and 200 yardxdash. her
third place ﬁnish in the long jump and leg
on the victorious 4xl00 relay (52.3).

ing. As far as high school I haven't been
running as well as I could. If I work at it I
know I can improve. oh yeah."

ings to earn the save. ’

The Danes used the same mix-
ture of single and double hits
coupled with stolen bases and
walks in their 7-6 defeat of Divi-
sion I Colgate. The Danes scored
two runs in the first inning on an ‘
error, two walks, and an RBI
single by Bob Martilla. They add-
ed another run in the second,

receiving the win. Steve McCloy
finished out the seventh. pitched
the eighth, and one third of the
ninth. John Kalinski stepped In to
get the final two outs ofthe game.

Going into Sunda’y’s'
doubleheader against LeMoyne. a
highly reputable Division II team,
the Danes were, according to
Zaloom. “Very impressed by the
reputation of the other team,
which is something you cannot be
in any sport. we went into the
game very teltative and tight."

It was this attitude that ac-
counted for the team's l0-I loss in
the first game .of the
doubleheader.

For the second game, however.
the Dane attitude toward their
opponent changed.

“We came ottt different." said
Zaloom. "We decided we were
the better_ team. we were more
confident. We decided the way we.
wanted it to be was the way it
would be and we made it come
out that way. And I believe the
support we received from the
home crowd was also a factor."

The new outlook resulted in a
10-9 victory for the Danes. a vic-
tory that puts their overall record
at 8-9-l going onto Tuesday's all
important conference
doubleheader against
liinghmuton.

“We have to win four ofour
six rcmttining conference games
to make the playoffs." said
Zuloom. “We. plnyed a
doubleheader nguinst
liinguhmton earlier in the-season
which we split. and now the team
is playing better every duy.,
'l‘hcy‘ve become more aggressive
at the plate. something I hope
they will match in the field. Right
now. we're playing tense and up

She also won with teammates Rachel

honorable mention status. Joining them
was Pam Robinson for her personal best in

“_I thought we would be in the middle.
Binghamton let up spots they could have
been stronger in if they wanted to." Coach
White added. “It's nice to see personal
bests this early in the season especially for
those who can still qualify for states. It’s
not just the standouts but the depth. The
weather conditions were also very good.”

Anderson added. “I think everyone's
showing some improvement. I’m really
pleased with the progress of the entire
team.”

Some other outstanding events included
the two through four placing of Robinson,
Anderson and Barb Saipley in the shot
put. The one through fourplacing of

The ﬁeld events were very strong as
Shipley, Anderson and Robinson placed 2.
4, 5. In addition Robinson and Saipley
placed 2. 4 in the discus. Barrett'and Innis
placed 2 and 3 In the long jump.

“I was really pleased, once again
everybody placed in the events they
entered.” Field Events coach Amy Kidder
added. “Barb had her best day in shot put
I’ve seen this year, I think each meet we’re
getting stronger and stronger. I think that
we haven't peaked yet."

Thus far fourteen individual com—
petitors have qualiﬁed for the state meet
along with the 4x100 meter and the 4x400
meter'relay.

As co-captain Barb Shipley summed it
up. “Everybody is improving every imc
out. Those who qualified for states should
be able to make a good showing in states.".
