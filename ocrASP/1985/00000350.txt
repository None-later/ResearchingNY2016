Men tracksters beat RPi. ,loseeby

STAFF WRITER

The Albany State men's track team
moved one step closer to its eighteenth
consecutive winning dual meet season with
.i 93-79 victory over Ri’i. Saturday at Coi-
gate University.

The Danes fell to tlteir hosts. however.
by an 87-84 score. Titc itteet was scored on
a dual tneet basis.

Albany‘s record is 3»l. with four duals
remaining on its schedule.

A winning season is especially important
to Bob Munsey. wlto was tlte team‘s coacit
iit 1968. its first seasoit. and who has had
winning records with tlte outdoor tcattt
each year.

“it looks like we‘re goiitg to bow otit
with a winning scason." said .\1uiisey.who
is retiring after tltis etttttpaigtt. His retire-
ment is only partial. however. as ltc will
continue to eoaclt the cross-country team
next fall.

Bob llalaeltantlrott is not tlte retiring
type. Tlte boisterous fresltttialt broke ottt
of a slump iit a big way Saturday iit winn-
ittg the triple jump. His winning titark of
44' 3 3/4" bettcred his prc\ious collegiate
best 01'42' tl‘ ‘: " which he set indoors. l’atil
Mance (43‘ 4 3/4") and Ajay Uiipta (42‘
5‘2") contplctetl Albany‘s sweep of the
went which clinched the win oier R.l’.l.

The Daitcs ltad only one scorer iii the
hammer throw. but the scoring perfor-
mance was quite ititpressiie. Marc Mer-
ciirio heaved tlte ball and cltain 173' l" to
win it. The scitool record iii the hammer.
which he currently holds. is 179' 6".

Tile All-American also won the discus

with a 143' 10" throw. Freshman Mike
Nelson was sixth overall in 102‘ 5".

Albany received unexpected help iii the
pole vault from senior Joe Pastel. who
won by clearing 13‘. Pastel was on the
team during his freshman year but had
strayed from the Danes sittcc then. Recent-
ly he returned to the track. Said Munsey. “
He picked up a pole aitd did 13' in street
clothes. [He] is one very gifted kid and a
student of the art."

Pastel also remembered enough about
the jtl\‘t.‘lill to place fourth with a 150' 9"
tltrow.

Tlte Danes received unexpected help of
another kind front .liin Erwin. who will
have carried 12 varsity letters iii the runn-
itig sports by next month. The Rochester
native lowered his best 5000 meter tintc by
23 seconds cti route to qualifying for the
state meet. Unfortunately for Erwin. ltis
tittte ol' 15:05.3 was identical to that of
R.l’.l's Steve thttil. who crossed the liite
first.

"it was a beautiful race." said Munsey.
"there was just barely daylight between
them when they crossed."

('raig l’arlato was fourth itt 15:38.8.

'llie Danes picked itp wins iii the other
distance events. though in less exciting
fashion.

Junior Ray Volpcr led two teatttntates iii
the steeplccltasc. His time of 9:56.8 was
less than two seconds sity of the state meet
qualifying standard. He was followed by
Jack Glaser in second (10:05.2) and
Charlie Blanehet itt fourth (10:18.4).

Ed McGili cruised to an easy win in the
“1.000 meter ruit. defeating the second

placed fourth.

The middle distances were also a source
of fine performances for the well-balanced
team.

Sophomore Dave Blette continued his

excellent early-season running by covering-
‘800 meters in i:58.3 to place second.

Freshman Craig Barbieri was fourth‘in
2202.4.

Tim Hoff finished only three second;
behind R.P.l.'s All American. Scott
LeMay. in the 1500 meter run. Hoff was
third in 4:04.6. Pat Paul was' fourth
(4.15.6).

Munsey's sprint crew. which suffered
from a couple of between-seasons defec-
tions, was further damaged by leg soreness
which struck John Reilly and Mike
Riggins.

Riggiiis placed second in the 100 meter
dasit in 10.9. bttt according to Munsey,
probably would have won if healthy. He
was also second in the 200 meter dash
(22.9). Reilly was fifth (23.2).

Reilly fared better in the 400 meter dash
itt which he finished third in 50.5. Ed Levy
was fifth (51.8) and Paul Fauty sixth
(52.0). Of Levy and Fauty. Munsey said,
“Both guys are getting better and better
every meet."

in the 400 meter intermediate hurdles.
Bruce Van Tassel finished fourth (57.2)
and Mike Bivozi. a freshman. was fifth
(59.6).

Van Tassel has been bothered by a sore
foot recently which has restricted his train-
ing. Nevertheless, he placed second in the

Albany's relays were weak due to the
ailments of Riggins and Reilly. The 4x400
team MikevGusmano. Fauty. Levy and
Blette was a distant third in 3:39. A win in
that event would have given the Danes the
overall victory over Colgate but Munsey
elected to rest Riggins and Reilly due to
their physical problems and the im-
probabiliti of beating the Red Raiders“
3:21 squad.

Albany placed second in the 4x100 meter
relay. The team of Riggins. Levy.
Gusmano and Reilly combined for a 44.2
clocking which beat R.P.i.

Mance was one of the Danes’ six ﬁrst
place ﬁnishers. He long jumped 21’ 9".
Balachandron was two spots back with 20'
5 1/4".

The other field event scorers were Gupta
in the high juntp. who cleared 5’ 10" for
third. Pat'Dowling placed in the pole
vault.

Although Albany topped R.P.l. and fell
to Colgate. the Engineers defeated Col-
gate. 88-83. .. .

The Purple and Gold will be on Route

‘in the invitational taught us how
races work."

The men did not fair as well as

‘ the women. failing to place in all
the races they entered. According

“it was an enlightening ex-

Bernard DoMinh put it. “Our

We were served humble pie in

The team feels. though. that

Union a run for the money."

The game actually began well
for the Danes. with Luke Becker.
a midﬁelder coming off an ankle
injury. assisted by Rick Trizano
scoring just 10 seconds into the
ﬁrst quarter. Oswego scored with
just over a minute remaining in
the'quarter to end the t ’ t quarter

with a H tie.

Just over ﬁve playing minutes
later. however. the score was a
very lopsided 6-1. as the second
quarter.‘ starring the Oswego
defense. began. Before it was
over. Oswego would add three
more goals to their score, raising

.their half-game total to nine. 0n-

ly Brad Rabinowitz. assisted by
Gary Friedman. and Friedman,
assisted by Dave Cerny. would
score for the Danes. giving the
half a final score of 9-3.

Third period action saw the
Danes more in control of the
game. as they outscored Oswego.
4-2. Friedman. Jim McPartiitt.
Cerny and Trizano scored for the
Danes.

Seven penalties. according to
Naugitton. were the ntain reason
for the Danes' scoreless fourth
quarter.

“When you don‘t have the
ball," said Naugitton. “you can't
do too much."

Meanwhile. Oswego used their
possession to score five times in
the quarter. giving the game its
final 16-7 score.

“We can take consolation in
the fact that we kept playing until
the end." said Naughton. “We
didn’t always play intelligently.
The game changes so quickly; it
takes a lot of poise to remain con-
trolled and stay on top mentally.
'You can't get caught up in the
game. you have to step back."

“We don't do any one thing
wrong." said Naughton. "We're
con'tinually having four minute
periods in which everything seems
to go wrong. like a snowball
effect."

The Danes had three such
periods on Saturday; two coming
in the second quarter. in which
five goals were scored by Oswego
in just over five minutes and three

goals were scored in just over

four. and one in the fourth. in
which Oswego scored three times
in four minutes.

“We have everything.” said
sophomore Brian Robinson.
“We're physical, we have finesse
and we're a team of hustlers. but
we just can't bring it all together.
We‘re like titrce different teams at

_ if it’s not one thing. it's another. One
day it could be hitting. the next defense.
There is always something that stands in
the way of a perfect performance for the
Albany State softball team, whose chances
of a SUNYAC playoff berth is now
slim.from a post-season. _ '

That was the story until Saturday‘s
doubleheader against Herbert Lehman.
Playing in top form with every aspect of
their game on target. they soutidly
defeated Lehman. 10-3. 18-2.

“A lot of good things happened on
Saturday." said coach Lee Rhenish. “First
of all we played well offensively as well as
defensively. l was also very proud of them
-— that they were able to come back and
play well after the two defeats against
Oneonta." '

On Thursday. their game wasn‘t on
target. as they dropped a twinbill to
Oneonta. The squad lost the first game.
4-2. and then after being interrupted by
rain. fell in the second. 5-2.

With it. came the harsh reality ofshitttered
playoff dreams. .

“Losing those two to Oneonta. 1' im-
agine. put us out of the'SUNYACs.” said
a disappointed Rhenish.

Scoreless until the fourth inning. both
teams scored a run in that inning.‘The
sixth inning was the decisive one. with
Oneonta scoring three runs and the Danes
coming ttp iwo short after nailing one.

“We had eight hits but we weren't able
to capitalize on them. There were errors
that cost us the ball game,“ said Rhenish.

lit the second gamen‘thc Dragons came
out biintlrtg and took the Danes by'sur-
prise. scoring five runs in the first inning.
Rlicnish felt her team should have played

. tip more on defense. it was their first‘tlme '

playing on a grass infield which makes the
ball slower than on dirt. ; ~
Oneonta's element of surprise gave them

the win. as the Danes were never able to

make up the difference. Albany only
scored a run iri.the third and sixth innings. '

to bring the score to 5:2.

 

Albany had five hits and .Oneonta
scored seven. but the key to this game was
who could capitalize on them. ..

“We had to be patient about our hit—
ting." said Rhenish. “You .just can‘t
whack at the bail. We had to be cautious
when we had runners on base." .

As usual. pitching was ,not‘{a problem.

.lunior Wendy Williams gave up two hits'in ‘

the first game. with five strikeouts. in the

second game. she gave up seven hits .and-'

struck out twoDragons with no.walks.,

Even with William's dynamic pitclting.
“believe it or not we still lost it." added
Rhenlsh.

The Danes turned this loss around and- _ '

handed a 'worse heating ‘Itou. Herbert
Lehman. Theycame out strong, scoring 7
runs in the first inning to Lehma‘nfsSingic
run. They finished off their opponents by
holding them to two runs and scoring three
more for themselves. - 1‘ v .‘
Kelly Brown'and Monique Romaro had
two hits apiece. One-of Romaro‘s' was a
homerun. Beth‘Wolf. Kathy Chichestcr.
Carmen Guzman. and Jackié‘Sheridan all
had a hit apiece. ‘ ‘
“Hitting has been a problem." said
Rhenish. “We really let loose. We ran the
bases-well. too. i was really proud..lf they
didn‘t have fun in these two games then
they don't know what this” game is all

about. it was fun because we were doing so '

well."

Danes had a 3-1 lead going into the" fourth
inning. itt which they scored six runs. The

‘dyitamic‘ .Dttttesifoilowed that 10-1 lead. »

the fifth and seventh innings. '

For the. last inning of the second game.
Romaro pitched. facing only three batters.

“it washer first pitching experience
ever." said Rheitish. "Three up and three
down. it was it great way to end the
game." _ .1 , I .

Much of’ the team‘s success hits to do
with Williams. She has pitched 75% inn-

ings facing 260 batters with only 40 itits off
her. 23 runs. and 15 walks. Additionally.
Williams has only given up seven earned
runs. Her 73 strikeouts show the impor-
tance of her presence on the field. She has
a .065 earned run average. leading her

double header on the road at 2 pm. On
Thursday they host Siena at 2:30 in a home
twin bill.
