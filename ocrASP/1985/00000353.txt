said Foote. "i would say compared to the
other positions. the Yankee catching posi-
tion is weak."
‘With Butch Wynegar and Ron Hassey
almost past their prime: the Yanks are
desperately seeking a phenom to emerge.
Scott Bradley. who is on the N.Y. Yankee
roster. hopes to play spot duty as a cat-
cher. but. according to Foote.-he's better
suited for first base.

“Bradley isn't a natural catcher." said
Foote bluntly. "But you got Mattingly at
first. so where are you going to put him?“

Columbus' starting catcher. Mike
O'Berry. who is in his late 205. came close
to making the Bronx team.

"Lombardi's got much more talent than
O'Berry." said Foote. in his matter-of-fact

"You get a chance to live on your own."
said Destrade. "l've grown up in a hurry.
Otherwise. l'd be in college somewhere.
This way. i get to meet people and see a
lot of the country."

Besides. as Manager Barry Foote puts it.
"it‘s tough. but it beats working. it's a
tough job. but you're getting an oppor-
'tunity to do something you love doing.
For all the tough parts. the positives
outweigh the negatives. it's the only way
to reach the big leagues.“

But baseball is a numbers game. and_

Destrade realizes it. There are too many
players and too few positions open in the

When O‘Berry's name was mentioned
to Lombardi. a seemingly confident smile

creased his dark face. "WhenJ reach~ -'

O'Berry‘s age. 1 hope l‘ve already made

Lombardi inquired about the weather in
Albany and seemed stunned when he
was told that it was snowing there now.
Born in Texas and raised in California.
Lombardi is not used to playing in cold
weather. He should be in for a culture
shock this spring living in Albany.

"Actually I won't mind playing in the
cold." said Lombardi. "it'll be a good
change for a while." I ,

As he spoke. you could tell he was ex-
pecting his stay in Albany to be a curt

did make the Yanks. it would be a dream
come true for the Cuban-born Destrade.

“The Yankees are big in Cuba." said
Destrade. "You associate baseball with
the Yankees there. not the Padres."

When Destrade was four. he moved to
New York where he got a chance to see
the fabled Bronx Bombers in person. As a
child. Destrade could only dream about
playing in Yankee Stadium. As an
Albany-Colonic- Yankee. the dream is in
reach.

"With more experience. i know i can

best and let the chips fall where they

sparked a strong reaction from Jewish

groups on campus because or anti-scruitic
statements attributed to him in the past.

The minister was invited to speak by the
Albany State University Black Alliance
(ASUBA).

. When it was announced that Farrakhan
was being brought here. an immediate call
to action was initiated by the Jewish
oroganizations on campus.

At 6:00 Wednesday evening the first
demonstration began when 25 members of
Revisionist Zionist Alternative (RZA) led
by President Gady Buiumsohn _held a

. prayer session in front of the Performing

Arts Center.
“Farrakhan to us is equal to a Nazi. We

are opposed to everything he stands for as- '

to SUNYA, we protest him as a human
being."

Mordechai Levy. leader of the Jewish
Defense Organization (JDO), which is the
militant branch of the now disbanded
Jewish Defense League (JDL) joined RZA
members. Levy said that he and other
members of the JDO had flown in from
New York City to express their opposition
and lend their support. '

“Louis Farrakhan is a klansman with
black skin. there is no difference between
his ideas and that of the klan." said Levy.
“We have no fear of standing up to our
enemies. and Farrakhan is a proven enemy
of the Jewish people," he said.

Buiumsohn stressed that RZA was in no
wtty affiliated with the JDO, although they
believe in their cause arid support them.

The RZA demonstrators mm ed down to
the LC area at 7 p.m. As people gathered.
the protest turned vocal with chants of
“Who do we want...Farraklmn. how do
we want him...dcad.” and "Jews ttttitcd
will never be divided."

As the line of people waiting to get in-
side LC 7 to see Farrakhan speak grew. so

did the furor and the numbers outside.

Barker.

According to Damino. “No one

Department only asistcd the SUNY
Public Safety Offices.

SASU held a press conference
Wednesday morning, before the
Board of Trustees discussed the
issue of divestiture. "Six years ago
students called for full divestment
of SUNY." said Susan Wray,
President of SASU and a student
Trustee on the Board. “The
Trustees responded by endorsing
the Sullivan Principles. [but] we
find this to bc a grossly inadequate
response."

in l979. the Board of Trustees
adopted the Sullivan Principles,
which calls for companies to pro-
mote cquulity for blacks in South
Africa through a set ol' six
guidelines designed primarily for
the workplace.

SUNY currently has ttpprox-
itnatciy $i4 million invested in
