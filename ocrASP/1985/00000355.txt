Wilson reward fund establi§h9d

By Bette Dzamba
EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

A reward fund to help in the
search for missing SUNYA stu-
dent Karen Wilson has been
established according to Doug
Lankler a friend of Wilson's.
“The fund stands at $5.000
now," said Lankler.

“The fund was set up by
Assemblyman Sam Colman" and
was donated by members of the
Assembly. said Lankler.

Beth Stevens. a resident assis-

tant in Seneca Hall on lndian
Quad. said money being raised by
Senaca Hall would probably be
donated to the reward fund. also.

According to Lankler. Wilson’
mother will be in Albany on Tues-
day to announce the reward at a
press conference.

Nancy Loux, an administrative
aid in SUNYA's Public Safety
Department. said that there have
been no new developments in the
case. “The case will be open until
some determination is made." she
said. “Leads do trickle in still but
fewer people are working on the
case since there is less to do." ad-
ded Loux. The State Police also
reported no new developments.

Sloane Norman. a sophomore
at SUNYA. wrote a petition‘in an

tion for the case. The petition,
signed by 2,000 students. calls for
“the speedy establishment of a

work to aid authorities coast to

appeals “in particular to the re-
cent disappearance of our fellow
student and friend Karen
Wilson." said Norman.

Efforts to present the petition
to state government officials are
“pretty mttch at a standstill."
said Norman. because "we decid-
ed to do things locally first."

Norman. Schaffer ‘sertt packets

campuses.

Mark Foti. Wilson's boyfriend.
said that he supplied Schaffer
with 5,000 posters to be
distributed to the campuses.
.Norman said that she and her
roommate Marlene Thebien at-
tempted to get the NBC television
network to announce the disap-
pearance coast to coast. “They

I couldn't because they get so many

ple every day." she added.

Wilson is believed to have been
last seen walking south on Fuller
Road towards Washington
Avenue on March 27.

Wilson is about 5'3" tall. She
weighs “5 pounds and has light
sandy brown hair and light brown
eyes. On the night of her disap-
pearance, she is believed to have
been wearing blue jeans, a blue
short sleeved shirt. a white rain
coat, and white tennis shoes. it is
possible that she was wearing
large rimmed glasses.

formation is urged to contact the

Although both the Assembly
and the Senate were being lob-
bied. more emphasis was placed
on the Assembly. Glenn. said,
because the Lesbian and Gay

it to the floor in that house.

 injvestigatES stadeints ’, drinking habits

By Matthew Gavan

.srar‘r warren

' Some SUNYA students. who
might have otherwise had empty
mailboxes one night a few weeks
ago. instead received a student
drinking survey.

The survey contains 202 ques-
tions which probe into a variety
of different areas ‘such as drinking
habits. drinking preference. and
the frequency that students drink.

This research project is the
creation of Professor Christopher
Smith of the Department of
Geography and Regional Plann-

ing; The survey is being co-‘

sponsored by the ofﬁce of Stu-
dent Affairs. ’
' Smith explained that his reason
for the survey comes from a basic
curiosity. "I've been at SUNYA
for five years now. We often
been told that if you don't drink.
you're considered a social out-
cast." he said. “I‘d like to ex-
amine that feeling closer and see
how it would be affected by
public policy changes."
According to Smith. “1 assum-
ed that iStudent Affairs would

> know a lot about student drink-

ing. But 1 found that their
knowledge was anecdotal 'and
quite general."

Dr. Frank Pogue, Vice Presi-
dent for Student Affairs explain-
ed that he took the opportunity to
use Smith’s survey to gather more
information about student
drinking.

“Alcohol has been proven to
be a depressant." said Pogue.
“Naturally. this could have an ef-
fect on a student’s academic per-
formance. We are-an academic in-

stitution which gives us a concern
for our student’s performance.
We have made a conscious effort
to set up alcohol awareness pro-
grams. Hopefully. the data Pro-
fessor Smith provides us with
from his survey will increase our
understanding of the situation
and help the programs."
According to Pogue. if the data
produced from the survey will
help improve the services offered

'by SUNYA. then it is a wor-

thwhile undertaking.

“Student Affairs has been very
cooperative." Smith said. “They
supplied me with a list of 1.000
randomly picked students to
receive the survey.”

“1.000 students. from 6.000 on
campus. gives a sampling percen-
tage which should prove to be
fairly accurate. assuming a five
percent margin of error." said
Smith. “We don‘t anticipate all
the surveys to be returned. if we
get back 500. we‘ll be fortunate."

According to Smith. people
usually downscale the ﬁgures. on
this type of survey. anywhere
from 25 percent to 50 percent.
“We assume students will under-
estimate. This accounts for the
margin of error. Hopefully the
students will be as honest as possi-
ble on the survey." he said.

“in addition to the questions
that Professor Smith provided us
with. some were added by the
“21" Committee. The committee
is concerned. with the impact of
the possible 21 year old drinking
age." Said Pogue. “They are in-

terested in the drinking patterns
of the students. and what affect
the change in local legislation
might have on them."

The survey will have no bearing
on the possible change in the
drinking age. Smith 'said. adding
that this is purely a research pro-
ject. "i am a social scientist with
an interest in public policy." ex-
plained Smith. “1 am‘curious to
know why students drink and
what the effects are. Student

drinking is a fascinating
phenomenon because it is quite
peer-oriented and socially
molding." he said.

The survey is being funded by
an award given to Smith by the
SUNYA small grant program.

'Smith received the grant last year

so that he could look into the
drinking behavior patterns and
reactions of the students at
SUNYA.

“Student Affairs picked up the
nominal cost of the mailing of the

surveys to the students." added

smith.

The data will be compiled by
Smith over the next few months
and should be available for public
access in early September. Smith
said he feels the problem of stu-
dent drinking is overblown. “The
statistics gathered should add
some clearity to the situation."
.said Smith. D

Responsible drinking goal of SUNY

By Beth Flnneran
STAN" WRITER

Not only are SUNYA's three other university
centers all reconsidering alcohol policies in light of
the possible purchase age hike to 2!. but an increas-
ed need for alcohol awareness has become apparent
at campuses also. .

At SUNYA. an “Effect of 21“ Task Force has
held several hearings already. following the im-
plementation of an alcohol policy last year designed
to deal with the problems of the l9 purchase age.

Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs at
SUNY Stony Brook Samuel Taube. commenting on
the effectiveness of their program. said it had been
.successfttl “because our goal has been to really raise
consciousness and promote responsible drinking."

Taube continued. saying that Stony Brook’s
policy was a “comprehensive alcohol policy that
covers faculty, staff. and students.“

According to Taube. Stony Brook‘s policy was
enacted in January. following an interim policy
which had been in place for the previous two years.

Stony Brook. Taube said. uses a formula to
determine the amount of alcohol allowed to be serv-
ed at parties. which includes estimating the number
of legal age drinkers and providing enough alcohol
for each drinker to have one drink per hour. He em-
phasized that this was only used in the planning of
the party and not at the party itself. where the

amount of drinks is left to the individual.

Taube said that the intention is to discourage in-
toxication and added that the policy also requires a
proportionate amount of food and non-alcoholic
beverages to be served.

However. Stony Brook's Student Association
President. Rory Aylward. said problems with the
policy do exist.

“We're kind of coping." he said. adding that the
one drink per hour guideline" sets very conser-
vative limits." He also said that the limit resulted in
a shortage of alcohol at times. causing parties to
end earlier.

“Once a committee's formed it will change."
Aylward noted. stressing that “the intent was to
promote responsible drinking." but that the
University administration was “naive on the whole
issue."

SUNY Binghamton's Student Association Presi-
dent Margie Lefﬂer said that at her school parties
must have food and alcohol permits must be ob-
tained. No decision had been made as to whether
the campus would go dry if the twenty one year old
drinking age passed. she added.

"My gut feeling is that if we go 21 we‘re going to
go dry." Leffler said.

Vice President of Student Affairs at SUNY
