THE NEWPORTSI

By Johanna Clancy
STAFF IHH TER .

According to the Puritans of
colonial times. long hours and
preserverance bring their own
rewards. For the manager of Stu-
dent Assoclation's Contact Of-
fice. hard work has paid off with
a $300 stipend increase and the
doubling of some of the office’s
sales.

Central Council raised Tim
Hallock's stipend from Show to
$1,300 several weeks ago. in
recognition of the turn around
the Contact Ofﬁce has overgone.

Hallock “has been the best
manager we have ever had." said
Suzy Auletta. SA Vice President.

In his year as Contact Ofﬁce
manager. Greyhound and
Trailways ticket saleshave doubl-
ed. November sales. before
Thanksgiving break. went from
38.000 to $16,000. according to
Hallock. who attributed the in-

crease to greater publicity and to

an efﬁcient and competent staff.

"1 was underpaid from the
beginning." Hallock said.
Previous stipends were $1,800.
but in the past two years the
amount had decreased to $1.000.

“He .worked far over the
number of hours. He found
bonuses and worked out great
deals. He made the ofﬁce run
professionally, the way it should
be run." said Aulettal

The Contact Office sells
Greyhound and Trailways bus
tickets to any destination. it also
gives out tax stickers to students
who don't pick them up at
preregistratlon. '

The main services. though. are
two SA owned copying machines.
one of which has the capacity. ac-

cording to Hallock. to reducep

double-side print, collate and
staple copies. The Contact Ofﬁce
charges 6 cents a COPY. as com-
pared to 10 cents a copy at‘ the
machines in the library.

“We operate on a priority
level. though basically we do
things as they come in. We're sen-
sitivevto SA needs and student
emergencies.” said Hallock. “On
a typical day the copy machine
never stops," he added.

According to Hallock. the
Contact Ofﬁce is a service branch
of SA.

"l’ve been involved with SA
for years. I feel I have .a good

working knowledge of campus
groups and their leaders." said
Hallock. “The SA is very happy
with me and this office." he
added.

Hallock put in extra hours last
fall when new workers were being
trained. “When there’s a need. i
have to be here." he said.

Many people see the results of
the Contact Office's work. stated
Hallock. noting how his ofﬁce
prepared all senior cards. registra-
tion forms and over l.000 packets
for Senior Week. “It gives us
pride in our werk and job
satisfaction when we see
something we've created like the
Guiness Day posters." he added.

As Contact Office manager.
Hallock handles all daily ofﬁce
preparations. _ "I make sure
there's enough paper and bus
tickets; I handle deposits. make
the schedules and do the monthly
bus reports."

Through increased copying and
decreased turn over time. the
Contact Office has contributed
more to SA than ever before,
Halloek said. “Largely due to a
veryefficient. competent staffthe

Contact Ofﬁce is very ﬁnancially

successful," he added.

Hallock was appointed by
Auletta. then approved by Coun-
cil. The hiring policy. according
to Hallock. has since changed.
Applicants must be interviewed
by a committee consisting of the
SA Vice President: Rita Levine.
Operations Manager of SA: and
the Minority Affairs Coor-
dinator. The Contact Manager
has input on future managers
also. "I write basic outlines and

stated Hallock.

Hallock has also helped with a
new SA venture. the Test Bank.
He handles financial matters. cost
analysis and deposits. “The Test
Bank was very successful for its
first semester. lt covered its costs,
and had accumulated enough
tests to get through finals. it may
even make a profit," said
Hallock. “It is forcing professors
to create new tests and gives equal
access to students." he added. [3
