have to keep this demonstration going.“

Members of .lSC-Hillel also staged a ral-
ly in front of the Campus Center Wednes-
day evening. The rally'was designed to be
"non—violent and non-confrontational."
according to Elliot Fromm president of
.ISC. who added that he hoped the rally
would serve to “educate the people on
campus to realize who Farrakhan is and
what he stands for."

Student Association Vice President Suzy
Auletta also spoke to the JSC-Hillel rally.
explaining that she was there to express her
opposition to Farrakhan and appologize
for SA President Rich Schaffer, who was
absent from the evening's events. V

Schaf fer was advised to spend the even-
ing away from the campus area and in the
presence of an FBI agent due to death
threats he had been receiving sihce Mon-
day night.

“I don’t know who there threats are
coming from,” said Schaffer. “I am in a
neutral position between those bringing
Farrakhan here and those opposed to him
coming. This leaves me open to threats
from both sides."

Before any SA funded organization
'books a speaker it must file a voucher to
draw money from its account in order to
pay the speaker.

ASUBA’s voucher was cancelled by
Schaffer after it was shown that ASUBA
and Pan Carribean Association. who had
offered to help ASUBA financially. “did
not have enough money in their remaining
budgets to cover the cost of the voucher,"
said Schaf fer.

In addition, the voucher was rushed and
did not fall into the proper time re-
quirements SA uses to prepare for guest
speakers or any performers, he said.

“Dwayne Sampson went and planned

the event months ago without telling
anyone in SA. He finally presented the
proposal to me eight days before the day
he wanted Farrakhan to appear.” said
Schaffer. .
f .“This didn’t allow us to make the pro-
per arrangements. If we would have
known further in advance there wouldn‘t
have been a time factor problem. but
that’s the way Dwayne Sampson
operates." Schaffer said.

Sampson was unavailable for comment.

According to ASUBA‘president Laurie
Midgett. “Minister Farrakhan was
ultimately funded by donations from the
public and a percentage of the gate." No'
SA money was spent. said Schaffer.

"We've never had to go through SA for
approval in the past" for the many
speakers that ASUBA has brought to
SUNYA. said Midgette.

while Farrakhan spoke to a packed lee-
ture center, Levy and RZA continued their
demonsuation outside. ' 1

“Those who brought Farrakhan here
will be treated as enemies of the Jewish
people and will (be) punished according-
ly." said Levy. “If they think we don't
mean business. they‘ll soon ﬁnd out other-
wise. We have the names, phone numbers
and addresses of those involved and they
will be punished.“

There were several shouting matches
between the protesters and the members of
the audience as they left. There were no
outbreaks of any violent acts, however.

Farrakhan
<Front Page

Odell Winfield, who introduced
Reverend Farrakhan. said “virtually every
Afro-American has faced some form of
racism. It appears that our Jewish brothers
and sisters are misguided.” He added.
“When we talk about racism they forget
about history.”

"Tonight," Winfield said. “we come to
learn, tomorrow we put in practice what
we learn." '

Farrakhan, addressing the ,
said “You have showed great courage."
speaking of students efforts to bring him
to Albany. “It shows that a new genera-
tion, a strong generation" is arising. “It
shows that you're strong enough to win the
freedom because you’re strong enough to
pay the price."

“I did not choose to be controversial. I
would feel better if everybody loved me."
said Farrakhan. "i have not stopped any
Jewish person from doing what they
want." he said.

He also said “There can be no peace as
long as there is injustice.” In explaining
the oppression of blacks he said, “Most
white students don't understand why
blacks feel the way they do.“ To the whites
