inspiration for the battle—Weary

By Patrice Johnson
Minister Louis Farrakhan: A
Man, Cries Aloud For All

the dream‘ of many.

Then shall I know peace and
taste true freedom. "

‘ vi: still-L, remember my great
grandmother baking apple and
blueberry pie in her southern kit-
chen in Orangeburg. South
Carolina. With sweat dripping
from her dark beautiful head be-
ing absorbed by the bottom tip of
her apron. and tears flowing from
her deep brown eyes. she would
sing. "The Lord will make a way
somehow...The Lord will make a
way somehow."

And I still can hear the little
hispanic boy on the corner of the
ghetto (when he's supposed to be
in school) saying, “What's the
use. 1'” never have nothing in this
society." until he believed it. All
his motivation became crippled
and his faith. paralyzed. And i
remember so clear how a few
nights ago angry Jewish students
hung up signs equating Minister
Louis Farrakhan with Hitler
while they banged on the doors

and windows of the lecture“

centers chanting. “Death. to Far-
rakhan." as l stood on line
W’ ting to hear this much hated

As Farrakhan spoke. in spite of '

themass Jewish protest and Stu-
dent ‘Association's attempt to
undermine this moment. my heart
began to bleed. i believe that my,
heart will bleed for" a long
time..£Farrakhan had even warn-
ed the audience that by the time
he ﬁnished speaking both blacks
and whites “will never be the
same” as long as we live.

For this man did not hate Jews
nor was he a racist. He wanted to
amend all that we have been strip-
ped of — both blacks and whites.
both Jews and Gentiles. Far-
rakhan addressed his present and
absent adversaries when he asked.
‘g‘if you hate me. ask yourself
why? Why. if i have not lynched
anyone? Why. if i have not stop-
ped a Jewish person from doing
anything that he wants to do?"
Farrakhan paused. and then
utilized powerful intonation when

changes in the event “21" is passed. said “i see not
very much changing'in terms of rules and

regulations. "

I‘ir‘ollcy would not change." Dye said. adding
that there would just be a “shift in terms of age."

My consciousness have been ‘

anst‘vering “these questions. “If
you ask yourselfrwhy do you hate
me. because i am a black man
that you do not control." The au-
dience awakened as they applaud-

ed and shouted words that surfac- '

ed their confirmations of this
statement.

Farrakhan. in an attempt to .

demolish the fabrications that cir-
culated concerning his hatred for‘
Jews added. “You may disagree
with me. :but that's o.k...but
don’t say that i hate ‘Jews because
i disagree with the state of
isracl." Farrakhan said he hoped
that instead of the Jewish
students protesting him outside
the lecture center. they would
have come inside to hear him
speak. He wanted to end the
distorted rumors and let the
Jewish students know that he car-
ried no hatred in his heart for
them.

Nevertheless. Farrakhan has
not let opposition or the possibili-
ty of assasination attempts cease
him from daring “to speak" all
he “believes to be true."

“i am not a man who can be
swept under the rug as though i
don't exist." charged Farrakhan.
indeed. his presence was felt and
received with warmth. although
outside the lecture center the 'at-
mosphere was one of hate and
coldness.

Farrakhan’s character was nakL
ed and genuine. He didn't sugar-
coat his knowledge nor did he
suppress it. The man is no
coward. “Professors do not en-
courage students to think beyond
them...the educational system of
America is-in stagnation. it is
repressive and oppressive...Har-
va'rd has produced lightweights
with a heavyweight drama...they

have produced economists that,

can not even solve the’problems
of the ec'onomy...students are
educated to, ser've- a system and
not 'to challenge it - this is
detrimental to whites and
blacks." fired Farrakhan as ’he
poured out his“ wisdom to a
hungry and satlabie audience.
The minister went on to address

'the administrative faculty who

know that there are many in—
justices in the educational system.
but are silenced in fear for their.
own jobs. He compared them to a
"prostitute who sells progress for
personal profit."

Many will perceive Farrakhan
as ,dangcrous_.u'Yes'; die‘is
dangerousdo a stillcd‘and stag-
nant educational system. He is
dangerous to stability and ine-

quality. He is dangerous to racial '

dependency and self-hatred. He is
progress and strength. He is
emergence and‘ change. He is
truth.

Farrakhan stated that “they
amend the constitution. but they
do nothing to amend the condi-
tion." Nevertheless we must not
continue to blame‘ white people
for our condition. We must study

who we are and then demand who .

we are. ' .

“The time is right for you and
me to do for ourselves. We need
black integration. We need to fall
in love with one another. We need
unity. The blacks and hispanics
must come together and ward ofi
oppression...we should stop
smoking. stop partying. and stop
using drugs. We must speed up
America...We can help America
save herself from herself ." are the
words that sent my heart pumping
for they had nourished me.

Farrakhan asked that the
whites divorce themselves from
the past and to learn about all
that blacks have contributed to
civilization. We need mutual
respect.

Farrakhan’s message was a
powerful one. it was one that
reﬂected the beauty and power of
courage and brilliance. “Are we
living in a human society? Are we
living in a just society." asked
Farrakhan. “No,” he said as he
shook his head and continued.
“No...no."

it was at this point that i recall-
ed my great grandmother singing.
“The Lord will make a way
somehow" and the little boy on
the corner saying. “What's the
use" and the Jewish students
chanting "Death to Farrakhan."
i knew that just as Farrakhan had
stated. our time has come “we
want the substance of human
living."

Farrakhan stated. "if my life
can be in some service to my
struggling brothers and sisters
then my living shall not be in
vain’." Your living is not in vain.
my great minister. i wish my great
grandmother could have heard
you. i wish the little hispanic boy
could have been rained on by
your wisdom and that the pro-
testers could have put down their
signs just for a while to hear you
speak. Perhaps there would be no
more division. but unity. We
could have all found. some unity
