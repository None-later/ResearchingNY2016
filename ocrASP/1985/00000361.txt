Protest planned for Showing ’of ‘Body D’ouble’

By Cnrlstopher Brady
STAFF WRITER

Continuing to display a mood of ac-
tivism and dissent reminiscent of the 60's.
students will demonstrate again Saturday
night to protest University Cinema's show-
ing of Brian DePalma‘s “Body Double."

Members of the Coalition Against Por-
nography (CAP) will begin their protest
against University Cincma's showing of
the movie at 7:00 pm. in the area near
Lecture Center 7. where the film is being
shown.

“Body Double" is the story of a
psycotic man who kills a woman. in one
particularly violent scene a pornographic
model and actress is killed by means of a
power drill. The scene shows the man us-
ing the drill by placing it against his groin
area as he repeatedly uses it to stab the
woman.

“Movies like this legitimitc acts of
violence against women." said Wendi Cer-
vi, co-chair of CAP. "People beconte
desensitized to tlte violence portrayed in
these movies. Movies are a part of life. and
these things happen in real life. We want to
make a statement opposing violence
against women."

CAP is the same group that protested
the showing of “The Opening of Misty
Beethoven" and “The Last Tango in
Paris.“ two x-rated films shown on cant-
pus in the past year. They also led the fight
to have the bookstore remove por-
nographic magazines frotn its shelves.

“Just because a movie has a big director
doesn't mean that it will not promote
violence against women and will not sex-
ually subordinate them." said Ken Dorn-
baum. co-chair of the group.

"We had originally wanted the Universi-
ty Cinemas to show a short film before the
movie called "Killing us Softly;" an anti-

porn film that depicts the subliminal uses
of pornography in advertising. television.
etcetera.”

“In the scene where the woman is killed
by the man with the drill held to his groin.
the drill is being used as a phalic symbol.
That's not art! Even the New York Times
has said that it's not art." said Dornbaum.

“Why would Brian DePalma want to
shoot a film glorifying the killing of
women. or of hating women?" he asked.
"We hope the University Cinemas will
have no porn on its schedual next year,"
he added.

“This is a film that promotes violence.
sexual and otherwise. against women. We
find this film to be pornographic despite
the 'R' rating," said Cervi. "This campus
is not safe for women and showing this
film is irresponsible." she added.

“Where do we draw the line on what is
pornographic?" asked Lisa Ferrick. direc-
tor of University Cinemas. “In the eyes of
the law this film is not pornographic."
said Ferrick.

“The film is not rated ‘X’. not that an
'X' rating is the only qualification for
what is pornographic," said Ferriek. “I
think that what they are protesting is that
this film is the latest in a series of Brian
DePalma‘s mosuganistic films.” she said.

"Should we not show a film just becaue
a woman is murdered?" asked Ferrick.
“That would mean that we would dis-
qualify the showing of ‘Psycho'.” she
added.

"In the murder scene the woman is fully
clothed and you never see the drill enter
her body. you think you do. but it‘s never
shown.“ Ferrick said. “But the scene is
unrealistic because she (the woman)
doesn’t even try to rttn away."

“(All in all) the film has great camera
and technical work." said Ferrick. Some
critics. she noted. have said that "the
movie should be seen for that reason alone

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though they didn’t out and out endorse
it."

"The protest should have no effect on
the audience turn out and we expect a
peaceful demonstration." said Ferrick.
“Some people at the last protest were
definitely not cool." she said. referring to
how some of the protesters got out of hand
and started shouting and grabbing at the
customers. “We don't want any thing like
that to happen again." said Ferrick. “I
can‘t let my customers get harrassed."

When asked about pornography on next
year’s schedule, Ferrick replied that “as of
now we have no porn on the schedule.”
She said, “We have a really great season
without it. Porn films are usually shown
because they traditionally draw a lot of
revenue. but this year they did only

average." she added.

“With elections coming up l can’t .be
sure." said Ferrick, “because who knows
what the next director may do."

“I'm surprised that CAP isn't pro‘
testing the showing of “A Clockwork
Orange." which was rated ‘X’ when it
came out." said Ferrick. “There are two
separate rape scenes in the movie along
with innumerable scenes of violence."

“i guess that there is a qualitative dif-
ference in the movies because “A
Clockwork Orange" redeems itself'in the
end and makes a statement about society
as a whole.” Ferrick added.

University Cinemas would'have shown

“Killing us Softly" she said. but members r,
l
i

of CAP were not able to get the film. E]
