' Between 100 and 400 SUNYA

students are at risk of being

threatened with a knife. gut. o

of being seriously beaten in a

year. statistics show. This risk can

not be diminshed by the “Don't

Walk Alone" campaign because

the incidents will happen in a

bedroom. or at a party. or in a

suite. or in an apartment. and the

perpetrator will be your dating
partner rather than a stranger.
Bewteen 12 percent and 22 per-
cent of high school and college
students have admitted to engag-
ing in a violent act with their part-
ners — the acts ranging from
threats and slaps to actually being
choked — the less serious acts. of
course, being more common.

Considering not all the students in

the sample may have been dating;

the. proportions could be as high

as 50 percent. according to some

researchers. These were typical
' students. and there are no reasons
. to believe that'Albany students
‘3 are any less typical.

SUNYA Social Welfare Pr0<
fessor Bonnie Carlson. an expert
»; in the area of couple violence.

defined violence as a behavior

that is intended to hurt. Jealousy.
. she said, is a major factor con-
' tributing to violence. People no
. longer have to get married to have
sex. so_dating relationships are
flasting longer, and are more
. variable. she added. With the ad-
ded insecurity there is jealousy,
anger. and ﬁnally violence. Of
course. this is not to say that mar-
'riage will act as a deterrent to
‘vioience. research has shown that
_ violence in a dating relationship is

i

'a good indicatOr'fOr violence in a-

marilal relationship.

Carlson also stated that alcohol
tended to “grease the wheels of
violence." In a study on physical
injury from couple violence there
’was no instance that wasn’t
preceeded by alcohol abuse. Ap-
parently, the disinhibiting affect

of alcohol escalated the likelihood

New York Times said. “these kids
don’t have a chance, the real story
is the doctors on the other side of
the building.”

A local bar owner added.
“these kids just don't have the
whack that kids in the '60’s had.
they have to learn to come
together." He also said that half
the’ alcohol related industries in
the urea. and especially in resort
toWns like Saratoga, would close
doyyn if the bill passed.

S udcnt Association of the
Stue University (SASU) Presi-
dent Sue Wray was 'the first to
speak at the rally. “We have
conic to our state capitol today to
send a message to our represen-
tatives. The message: 2! won't
work." She stressed “education

* not discrimination" and urged

legislators to “get down to the
business of saving lives."
Assembly member Vincent
Graber. Chair of the transporta-
tion committee and an opponent

 of “2!.” motivated the crowd so

much that they were calling for
him to be the next governor with
chants of “Graber '86."

“Let's not give in to this
federal raw Intimidation.
blackmail might be a better word.

 We can tread water until October
.: of '86. let's see what happens in

South' Dakota." he... urged

of argument and violence.
Alcohol abuse in a dorm at<
mosphere. therefore. is a breeding
ground for all types of aggres-
sion. whether it be vandalism or
throwing a beer mug at a seeming-
ly flirtatious date. Carlson further
explained. “if we -want to do
something about dating violence.
we must do something further in
this school's alcohol policy."
Couple violence seems to be an
increasing problem this year.
After Patrica Snyder. Assistant
Director of Residential Life.
spoke with some of the dorm
staff. she invited Carlson to con-
duct a workshop March 8. Accor-
ding to Carlson. the staff
members were not surprised at the
numbers. Carlson also found that

there are some couples on campus ’

for whom violence is a chronic
problem. .

Violence often follows a pat-
tern. she said. and once one has
been slapped across the face,
there is a greater likelihood that
he/she will be slapped again.

Nancy Smith. a Middle Earth
staff member, said that‘inquiries
about couple violence are “not a
huge category of calls." it was
more likely that people around
the violent couples would call
than the couples themselves.
“Most of the time a couple went
through a disciplinary process
and was referred for counseling."
she said.

Howard Woodruff, Area
Coordinator on Dutch and Col-
onial Quads, was surprised at the
rather high statistics on couple
violence. “There have been in-
cidents on both Colonial Quad
and Dutch Quad. but it wasn't a
huge problem." he said.

James Williams. Director of
Public Safety also stated that cou-
ple violence was not a big pro-
blem. Occasionally Public Safety
gets a cal. but it happens only
rarely, he said. However. “if it
happens once it is a problem," he
added.

legislators. in reference to the
South Dakota suit. “You're not
second class citizens...you're old
enough to vote. marry. own your
own property. serve in the armed
forces and pay taxes," he added.

Senator John J. Marchi. chair
of the finance committee. added.
“we face a serious challenge to
the integrity and self-respect of
the state of New York. The
disgraceful attempt by the federal
government to blackmail and
bludgeon the people of this state
into passing what we believe is a
bad law is simply unreasonable."

He stressed support for an 18
year old drinking age and up
pearcd angered by the threat of
the federal regulation. “We New
Yorkers are not a malignant alien
enemy. we are Americans and are
saddened by your threats of
blackmail.” He urged students to
"let your voice ring out."

Class of ’87 president Jackie
Bernstein. who marched to the
capitol. said she believes the
legislation will pass despite the
protest, as did many other
students who attended.

Scott Wexler. President of the
Coalition for Alcohol Reform.
said “today isn't the end of this
battle, we must stop this Inherent

prejudice against young people." ~

The ﬁrst step in ending violence
in a relationship is ending the
relationship. before more serious
incidents occur. ,Violence follows
a pattern and probably won’t end
with a threat or push. Jealousy
and anger are not signs of love.

If a more serious incident does
happen. however. don’t be afraid
to go to the Student Health Ser~
vice and seek medical attention.
In ' order to gain a clearer
understanding of how the victim
would actually have been treated.

of having been beaten by my

my problem. she said that I
“didn't have .tovpress charges"
and that i “could be vague" if I

appointment with a female doctor

main concern being to get me in

Most of all. people must
remember that being hit. pushed,
or threatened by someone you
love is not acceptable. No one
should have to be subjected to
