FRIDAY, APRIL 26, 1985 D ALBANYSTUDENTPRESS  

Joe DeMeo’s ATWA'squad head to Nationals

(AP) The atomic drops, body
slams and eye gouges'that make
up professional wresting don‘t
scare .ioe DeMeo.

“My heavyweights against their
heavyweights. Any place. Any
time. Any rules.” he says. scowl-
ing and fixing his brown eyes into
a stare. “And we'd win."

DeMeo is -
coach of the Frlday
A d i r o n d a c k
Three Style Sports
Wrestling Column
Association,
one of the most successful
amateur wrestling clubs in the
country and the defending na-
tionalchampionln Greco-Roman
style.

“l think professional wrestling
is good theatre. well-staged. Hulk
Hogan is great." the stocky
stockbroker said. “And l must
admit that when I went to watch I
enjoyed myself. even though i
knew there was no real wrestling
going on." v

Real wrestling. according to
DeMeo. is the purest form of
sport. “It's onelon-one and it’s a
real test of courage and nerve and
athletic ability." he said. '

And Greco-Roman. a style in
which the legs cannot be attacked
or used to pin an opponent, “is
the closest thing to a streetfight
there is, in sport." DeMeo said.

“Greco-Roman wrestling is a
violent. physical. crushing sport.
Done at it’s best it is nasty —
usually not much blood, but
there’s a lot of hammering going
on." he said.

A coach for more than 15

years. DeMeo has trained over 50
wrestlers who have appeared on
national. world and Olympic
G‘reco-Roman squads including
5 l984 Olympic Gold Medal winner
Jeff Blatnick. ‘
This weekend the Adirondack
> club defends its national title in
the USA -Wrcstling champion-
ships in Ann Arbor, Michigan
and'DeMeo says it will be a
struggle.

The chief competition will

«come from the Sunkist Kids, a na-
tional club sponsored by Sunkist.
"We lovingly call them the
Moneykist kids." DeMeo said. "I
would say their budget is around
$350,000. easily l0 times more
than ours." '

Usually the Adirondack team
raises between $15,000 and
$30.000 annually from area
businesses and other sponsors.
said DeMeo.

“This year so far we've raised
about 100 bucks," he said. The
club meets twice a week'for to
months a year and uses the wrestl—
ing room on the campus of the
State University of New York at
Albany. where DeMeo also serves
as wrestling coach.

About 60 to 80 percent of the
instruction is in Greco-Roman.
although freestyle and collegiate
wrestling area also handled.
DeMeo said. Freestyle or Olympic
style differs from collegiate.
which high school and college
wrestlers use. primarily in holds
allowed and point-scoring.

“We like Greco-Roman best
because it’s a war and i think
that’s why we're so good at it."

DeMco said. “We know it's a war
and other guys think it's a wrestl-

This year the club has about
125 members. from age to to 28.
all of whom are taught by
DeMeo, a national champion in
1966 at Cornell University and
former coach at Stanford.

“That even made the New

winners. He began wrestling for
