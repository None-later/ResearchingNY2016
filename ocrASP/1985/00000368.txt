Never Happen

 

That _Will

Daddy, could you tell me a bed time
story'l'

'Sure, Mikey. How about Gulliver's
Travels?’

‘Oh Dad, I'm sick of that one. Tell me a
real scary one.’ " . '

'How 'bout Frankenstein?

'No, that's stupid. Who'd ever believe
that”! Tell me one you made up. Those are
always the best.’

'All right.’ , - - -

'Once upon a lime there was a land with
many farmers. . .and the farmers had a lot
of land. . . so much land to farm that they
weren't able to do it. Unless they had help,
that is. . . but since most people were
farmers, there was nobody around to help
them and they didn't know what to do. . .

Until one day. . . people started shipping
in other people that they had captured in
foreign land and they‘ began to sell these
people to the farmers to help them with
their work.

But the captured people didn't always
like to‘do the other people's work, so
sometimes they complained, sometimes
they ran away, and other times they just
retused to do it at all. So the farmers started
to punish the other people. . . they'd whip
them, scold them, sometimes even cut off
their feet or sell them to another farmer to
separate them from their families. . .'

 

’Oh, come on Dad, people would never ‘

‘ needed someone to help them with their

to do it. Tell me a better story.’

'All right. . .here goes.  .
Once upon a time there was a real crazy
man who thought he was like a god. He
thought that he was better than all people
and only the peoplelhat he thought were
best fit to live in his world. . .so he created
a“ race of what he thought were perfect
people and tried to rid his world of all
other people. He stole them out of their
houses and sent them away to a place
where they were stripped, showvred in
poisonous gases. and cooked in ovens. . .'

'Dad. no real person would do that.
Make up another one.’

'One more try. . . I

Once upon a timethere was a world in
which every country feared the other. . .so
they built these devices that would protect
them from each other. . . these devices
became so complex that they could not on-
ly destroy the enemy, but also the world.
Satellites and laser beams were sent into
space hoping to stop the creation of these
weapons, but in fear more and more were
developed. . .with tensions increas-
ing. . .and then one country who had
become so afraid of all the others activated
their devices. . .'

'Oh , Dad. that would never happen!‘

‘Yeh. . .you‘re right. l guess l’m just not a
good storyteller. . .’ v
