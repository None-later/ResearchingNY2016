I f you missed the show General

ublic

Public put on down at the gym last

Sunday night, you really missed out.
Former English Beat vocalists, Dave
Wakeling and Ranking Roger hopped up
on stage with their new band and rocked
through an excellent mix of tunes from
their debut album. All the Rage. several
new songs from the upcoming Uan.) album.
and a couple of the best Beat numbers as
well.

 

Tom Kacandes

A half-decent warm-up band called
Charlie Peacock opened up the well-
attended Show with a set about 45 minutes
long. l‘eacock's sound in no way resembled
that of General Public. but it was difficult
to tell what it actually did sound like
because the vocals were very badly mixed
and the band was too loud as a whole, The
lead singer made the mistake of telling the
crowd: “It's time to raise your hands and
lingers" at which point the crowd gave him
a lot oi fingers guod-naturedly.

After a long wait for the stage to be
changed, the lights finally dimmed and the
other band members came on while Dave
and Roger waited lust offstage. When the
band started into "Are You Leading Me
OnT', the crowd's roar of anticipation built

. _ ‘ y until the two vocalists bounced onto the'
" stage. The crowd noise lowered as people
got busy with their dancing. but came back
in a rush when the band played "Save it
For Later", a Beat classic. With the excep- ‘
tion of "Tenderness", the audience seemed
to single out the more familiar Beat tunes
from the new band's compositions.
However,, it seemed that. like myself,
many people who were less familiar with
the General Public material became con-
vinced of its worth in the course of the
show: . ‘

Like the Beat, General Public's music

wit. Though didn't really catch my ear

"Anxious", T'Hot You're Coo|"-,""Day to“

Day" and the anti-nuclear anthem "Burning
Bright” were simply marvelous to dance to.
even with the Gym acoustics. The new
7 tunes were also very hot. Before the very

witty "Come Agai. . Wakellng asked the
crowd:"How many of you think there's a
difference between sex and religion?”

From what i saw at this show. General
Tubiic needs only a hit more work to
match the level' at which the Beat once
operated-Hopefully, the band will return
occasionally to their ska/reggae roots, Pop
