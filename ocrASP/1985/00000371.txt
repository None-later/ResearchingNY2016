MAY 1985
. e‘

A Straight-Shooting Star Behind the Camera

Is Ron Howard too good to be true? He doesn't smoke or use
drugs. He’s married to his high—school sweetheart. He has been a
movie and television star almost since infancy. “Splash” made
him one of Hollywood‘s hottest directors. and “Cocoon,” about
to be released, could seal his reputation at 31. An accompanying
story describes the training oﬂ‘ered at the nation's thriving ﬁlm
schools. (Cover photo by Jonathan Exley—LGI.) Page 4

Education: Honor Codes, Cliﬂis Notes
Honor—and the codes by which it is enforced—con-
tinues to bedevil colleges. Controversial cases at the
University of Virginia and the U.S. Air Force Acade-
my, among othcrs, have caused schools to reconsider
how students who commit academic oﬁ‘enses should be
accused, tried and punished. But both faculty and
students consider the codes to be valuable. Page 28
The NEWSWEEK ON CAMPUS Poll ﬁnds that most

students are content with their colleges.

Page 31

There is a Cliff behind Clith Notes, and he‘ll
sell nearly 5 million of the study guides this year.
A Cliff contends the books are not really academic

shortcuts.

College Baseball: Hitting a Hot Streak

College baseball is finally snapping its long slump.
Some tough new teams have emerged, the quality of
play has improved and promotional stunts like the
wedding of Miami's Maniac as well as increased TV
exposure have attracted the attention of the fans—

and the major leagues.

The Hulk on Wrestling, Fame, Prayer

Pro wrestling is having a slam-bang revival, and part of the
reason is Hulk Hogan, the 6-foot 8-inch, SOS-pound beach
boy who is World Wrestling Association champ and sweet-
heart of the rock-nnd-roll set. In a talk with NEWSWEEK’S

i

InJune Robert Parker will publish his 12th
novel about the cool, classy private eye
known only as Spenser. John Kassir is an
up-and-coming comedian, Jean Shepherd
a veteran ruconteur. Page 34

Is Cramming Worth It?

When ﬁnals loom, all-night cram sessions
bloom. But recent research on sleep pat-
terns suggests that staying up may be coun-
terproductive—and that stimulants can
hurt more than help. Page 26

Multiple Choice

A backyard bonanza at Texas A&M; a
student investment fund at Franklin &
Marshall; Vassar‘s study trip to Nicara-
gua; the latest spring ﬂing—Aerobic;
Hunter's junior year in New York; making
a suntan more livable. Page 24

Bad Debts: The Big Crackdown

The government is cracking down hard on
student-loan defaulters. Since December,
15,000 lawsuits have been ﬁled, and US.
attorneys are issuing press releases naming
the alleged deadbeats. Page 15

The New Face of the Clergy

As religious institutions change, so do ca-
reers in the clergy. Today's clerics are like-
ly to be older, better prepared and better
paid than ever—and there are many more
women of God. Page 23

My Turn: ‘Sophomore Slump’

Of all the agonics suffered by college stu-
dents, one of the most common and most
trying is the “sophomore slump.“ Seth
Rachlin describes how the slump struck
him, how he dealt with it and how his solu-
tion turned out. Page 36
