used to call him the Bob Cousy of comedy,”
says the show's creator, Garry Marshall,
“because Bob Cousy was such a versatile
basketball player, he could feed the ball to
others or when you really needed him to, he
could score himself."

Since establishing himself as a director,
Howard has put acting on hold. “I do like to
act," he says, “and once I get my directing
career under control I might want to case
back into it." Actually, now that he’s begun
to work more behind the lens than in front of
it, Howard has begun to enjoy his celebrity
for the ﬁrst time. “A wonderful thing has
happened in the last four or ﬁve years," he
says. “People have stopped making a real
big deal out of meeting me. They don‘t come
up and say, ‘Opie, how’s Aunt Bee?‘ They
say, ‘I hope “Cocoon” does real well’."

Fame hasn’t always been that easy to
handle. Ronny Howard learned how to
write so he could sign autographs in 1960
when “The Andy Grifﬁth Show" became a
smash. Separating his screen life from his
homelife wasn’t hard (“Acting wasn't being
natural. It wasn’t a game. It wasn't play.”),
but being a child celebrity did cause some
conﬂicts. "It was confusing when I went
back to school and would have to get into
ﬁghts and stuff to prove I was an OK kid.
But I always enjoyed it." Howard and his
brother, Clint—also a successful child ac-
tor, who starred on the TV series “Gentle
Ben"—did most of their growing up in mid-
dle-class Burbank and always attended pub-
lic schools when not working.

a fairly normal childhood. “When kids

would come up to me and say, ‘What's it
like to be a movie star?’ I‘d never really have
an answer because I didn‘t know anything
about it except working,” he says. “I had
two very separate lives. I didn't know any
Hollywood kids and I didn’t hang out with
any of them." Rance and Jean Howard told
Ron hedidn’t have to actif hedidn't want to,
and only once did he feel pressured to take a
job. Asked if he wanted to be in “The Music
Man," Ronny said he didn‘t want to miss
any of public-school ﬁrst grade. “I remem-
ber the vibes in the car," he says. "They said,
‘Oh, OK,’ but clearly they thought it was a
neat opportunity. Later, they asked me
again and I said, ‘Yeah. yeah‘."

While the protectiveness of Rance and
Jean Howard kept little Ronny untarnished
by glitz, it sometimes grated on the adoles-
cent Ron. Inparticular, he remembersbcing
“a little bit impatient“ to marry a girl he met
in his I lth-grade English class. Now hiswife
of 10 years, Cheryl Howard. a budding
screenwriter, remembers that Ron was"real
shy and nice when he talked in the class-
room." The product ofa Southern Baptist
upbringing, she hadn't seen his acting when
they began to date: “My dad wouldn‘t let
me watch much TV." The couple had to
overcome his parents' tight reins and her
father's initial distrust of show-business
people. “But my dad ended up liking
