learn more than you’ll ever need to know about

supply side economics, more on Boolean logic
than you ever thought necessary, and more about Ulysses
than even the most demanding cocktail party could ever
require. But nobody teaches you how the world works,
how to find an apartment, how to manage and invest your
finances, how to get started, really get started, on your
career. Nobody, that is, until now.

American Express is about to commence a broad
course in real world living. Beginning next semester,
American Express offers The Real Life Planner each month
in Newsweek On Campus. We'll provide practical advice
that will set things straight and help temper your anxiety
about what lies ahead.

Y ou can't learn everything in college. Sure, you’ll

Think about your future for a moment. Let's face it, you
have it pretty good right now. You probably work very
hard, are extremely dedicated, and are committed to
achievement and success. But you're also in school for
only 30 weeks or so each year, and classes only take up
about 15 hours of each of those weeks. Yourfirst job, on
the other hand, will take up about 50 weeks of your year;
your workdays will account for about 50-60 hours of your
week to start; and the tuition you've spent the better part
of fouryears complaining was too high, will suddenly look
pretty meager when the same figure resembles your
annual salary.

Graduation looms and you realize with a start that you
might not really know how to go about going about your
life. Rest assured. In each upcoming monthly installment

September 1985

Getting Started

In our September 1985 edition we'll take you
through your first job and help you with
some of those important beginning career
decisions. We'll help you decide which area
of the country holds

the most promise for

future growth in your

field, and we‘ll offer a

city-by-city chart

comparing cost of liv-

ing with average start-

ing salaries, to help

you determine how

much discretionary

income you'll actually

have to spend once

you get where you're

going. What are the

hot careers for the

years ahead and

where can you find them? We‘ll let you
know. You'll also find tips on finding your
first apartment or home, on settling in. and
advice on when and how to make that all-
Important second move.

Commonly held myth #1: I must he cer-
tain of my career path hefore I leave
school.

Not true; in fact, most college graduates
don 't remain in their first jobs for more than
two years. and many find themselves work-
ing in an entirely new field within five years
after graduation.

October 1985

Networking

In October, we'll cover the basic guidelines of
networking, the essential process of getting
yourself known and learning about others, of

seeing and being seen. We'll offer valuable

insight on calling on
friends, relatives,
alumni, and promi-
nent members of your
field for advice and
31‘} assistance; and we'll
_. give you pointers on
1:; looking for your sec-
' ond iob while still per-
; forming admirably
and loyalty in your
first—all in an effort
3; to help you on your
, . climb up the real
“a world ladder.
" ' Common/y held
myth #2: I'm hetter of! finding a ioh on my
own merits, without taking advantage of an
“in” I might have in my field.
Not true; networking of this sort is not
only common practice,
it's so prevalent you 'II
need to muster all of
your resources and
contacts if you're to
maintain a competitive
edge. While you may
land your first/ob sole-
ly on your achieve-
nrents and [oh poten-
tial, chances are you 'II
move on to your sec-
and position through
contacts you’ve either
made on your first
job, or on your own.

November 1985
Office Politics

Office politics command our attention for
November, as they will command yours
throughout your working life. We'll give you
pointers on how to cover your tail, how to
make your boss look good, and when to take
some of the credit for yourself. And, we'll
show you how to look for clues around the
office to help you determine what to wear,
what to talk about (and what not to talk
about), and which way the wind blows on a
number of issues. You'll also need knowl-
edgeable advice on when and how to ask for
your first promotion or raise, and how to
promote yourself without waiting for your
boss to do it for you.

Commonly held myth #3: If I pay atten-
tion to politicking and positioning, my work
will suffer. If I do my [oh well, I will he
noticed.

Not true; unfortunate or not, many on-
the-[oh promotions are as much promotions
of personality as they are promotions of per-
formance. Each and every office has its own
system, its own way of doing things—and

It's up to you to figure
out what's accepted,
and what’s expected,
if you 're going to get
along.

 

 

February 1986

Managing Money

In February, The American Express Real
Ute Planner will help you manage your new-
found and hard-earned riches. We’ll suggest
a system of personal budgeting, help you
plan for major

expenses, and point

you in the right direc-

tion with financial

advice that’s right for

you. How will you

choose an accoun-

mm? A banker? Why

are you a good credit

risk? And, how much

can you afford to

owe? We'll provide

the answers. and we'll

also try to save you a

few bucks.

Commonly held
myth #4: I shouldn’t spend more than one-
guarter of my take-home pay each month
on rent and utilities.

Not true: in fact, in certain parts of the
country you might expect to spend as much
as twice that amount to find decent living
arrangements. With careful money manage-
ment, though, you can handle such an
expense, and we'll help you develop your
financial priorities. You might have to eat at
home more often than you 'd like, switch
from imported to domestic beer, and start
repairing items you might otherwise have
replaced, but you'll manage.

March 1986
Investing

Invest your time with us in March and you'll
learn all a recent graduate needs to know
about investing, from owning your own
home to speculating in the stock market.
We'll help you spot
V the investment oppor~
tunity that's right for
you and foryour bud-
get. and where you
can go for profes-
sional advice about
each. We'll alsotalk

'. and explain why cer-
‘_ tain kinds of life insur-
" ance programs,
widely thought an
unnecessary expense
‘ for recent graduates.
might be one of the better investment oppor-
tunities available to you.

Commonly held myth #5: I'm not earn-
lng enough money to need an accountant,
or think about
investing.

Not true; an experi-
enced accountant can
almost always save
you some money, and a
can suggest several
investments rich in tax
savings. Banks, stock-
hrokers, and financial
planners can help you
find worth while in vest-
ment opportunities,
enen ilyou've only
got a few hundred
dollars to invest.

April 1986
Continuing Education

By April you'll be ready for our examination
of continuing education, a broad look at
graduate schools, night schools, and adult
extension programs to help you determine
when and if an advanced degree is a neces-
sary forward step. or Just a way to sidestep
the inevitable. And we won't limit our discus-
sion to continuing education in the strict
academic sense; we'll look at ways to
continue your education on your own.

Commonly held myth #6: I must go to
graduate school If I 'm going to get any-
where In my career.

Not true; in fact, many young adults
today have done extremely well in their
fields without even the benefit of an under-
graduate degree, so graduate schools
don ’t always hold the answers. Many
employers will pay as much attention to
real world experience as they will to a
string of degrees attached to your name.
This is not to say that graduate school is,
as a rule, a waste of your time and money,
only that an advanced degree is not al-

ways the only way
to your career
> advancement.
