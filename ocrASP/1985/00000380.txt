JUSTICE

wait too long. An ex-student who declares
bankruptcy ﬁve years aftera loan comes due
can be discharged from the debt, says Doris
Ann Duffy, who heads the debt-collection
unit for the US. attorney's ofﬁce in north-
ern Texas. But, Daffy adds, “most of the
time we will have sued them before it reaches
the ﬁve-year point."

Bankruptcy hardly oﬁ‘ers a free ride. Be-
sides harming a ﬂedgling credit rating,
bankruptcy can have professional repercus-
sions. William Gahan's application to the
Minnesota bar was rejected in 1979 because
he had declared bankruptcy, a move which
freed him from $ 14,000 in student loans.
Gahan, now a practicing lawyer in San
Francisco, blames his problem on loan offi-
cers who “refused to give me a break." Back
on his feet, Gahan reafﬁrmed his debts one
year ago and has begun to pay them back.

he government and cooperating

banks deserve some of the blame for

the loan-collection problems. De-
spite periods of interest during the Nixon
and Carter administrations, collecting bad
debts has rarely been a high federal priority.
At the same time, eligibility requirements
for loans were eased in 1979 and tuition bills
jumped—two related phenomena that in-
creased student loans. Some observers sug-
gest that during much of this period banks
wrote loans for students as freely as they did
for shaky Third World nations. “With stu-
dent loans, the banks will give money to
practically anybody because under federal
law the government will pay them back if
they are not paid off by the debtor," says
Blanchard in Los Angeles. “So you get peo-
ple with dubious backgrounds getting loans
of as high as $20,000." Some never ﬁnished
school, and some took only correspondence
courses of one form or another that did not
yield much income potential.

And somesimply didn‘t understand what
they were doing. A young woman who now
works at the University of Houston remem-
bers her loan checks as the functional equiv-
alent ofmanna. “It was so great to get them
in the mail—I never thought about the fu-
ture," she says. Aftershe graduated in 1980,
her father made the payments on her $7,955
loans. When he stopped last year, she was
left with a $1,250 monthly salary which she
uses to pay her rent and car payments but
not the $63.86 that the government wants
for her loans. “1 said I‘m sorry but I can‘t
afford it,“ she recalls. That excuse won‘t
stall the creditors for long. But whether she
pays or not, perhaps the Feds ought to be
concerned with just what she learned with
her college money. “I feel kind of ignorant
about the whole thing,“ she says. “It was a
treat to get a check to pay for school. but 1
just didn't think about what would happen
when it wu
