Making

Honor and

the Codes

Students like the system, but it may not always be fair.

Last springRudy Beverly, ﬁmnerstudenl-

council vice president for appropriations at
the University of Virginia. pleaded guilty in
state criminal court to a charge of embez-
zling $3. 000 in student funds, which he
agreed to pay back. The university's honor
system acquitted him. on the ground that. in
light if his record of campus service. his
Inisdeed was not "reprehensible"enough to
warrant the code 's single sanction—
expulsion.
u Last fall Virginia sophomore Monique
'Fawr'ett was tried by the honor system for
altering her grade on a calculus exam. The
jurors ditl not ttctitally prove that she had
changed the grade, Imt Fawcett was convict-
ed on the theory that no one else would have
alteretl il—antl she was expelled.

Two months later bask ethall player Olden
Polynice was tried for turning in an English
paper that he did In)! write. Polynice ad-
milled the act but claimed extenuating cir-
cumstances: pressure front the hectic team
schedule. Ile was acquitted.

The public attention attracted by these
cases helped prompt the Honor Committee to
examine some oft/re inconsistencies.

yet as the recent cases at Virginia
suggest, honor remains very much an issue
on campuses throughout thecountry. Colle-
giate honor codes may be central to the very

[ life ofthe institution, as at Washington and
Lee, or more perfunctory affirmations of
good intentions, as at Stanford; they can be
part ofa ritual for grooming Southern gen-
tlemen or extensions of basic religious be-
liefs. Whatevertheirform orpurpose, honor
codes seem to be heretostay. Thequestion is
not whether to keep the codes but how to
make them practical and fair.

For the most part, honor codes cover
lying. cheating and stealing; the bulk of
cases involve plagiarism or cheating on ex-
ams. At some schools the code is strictly
academic; at others it extends to every area
of student life. At all-women Hollins Col-
lege in Virginia, for example. the code was
changed last year so that violations ofsocial
regulations. such as drinking and after-
hours male visitation, are handled bya sepa-
rate committee; students took those infrac-
tions less seriously and were not inclined to
report them to the honor court.

Honor pledges are variously signed by
freshmen. by all students at the beginning of
each semester or every time a student takes
an exam. They often confer a large measure
of freedom—unproctored tests and take-
home exams—plus the painful obligations

to enable people to be responsible for their
own actions," says Len Clark. provost and
academic dean at Earlham College in ludi-
ana. “It’s not a very educational system if

it prepares people for responsibility but
doesn’t give them responsibility.“

The experience. for the accused, can be
frightful. “When you enter U.Va., they tell
you all this vague stuff about the honor
system, but they never orient you about
what to do if you‘re ever accused," says
Monique Fawcett, now enrolled at Long-
wood College in Farmville, Va. She first
learned that she was under investigation
when an honor adviser called her at 1 am.
She was told not to worry because9out'of10
cases are dropped, but 10 days later she was
presented with the formal charges and told
to leave the university or face trial. The trial
itself, she says, "gets kind of ugly. People
aren't just telling you that you did some-
thing wrong. They were trying to expose a
ﬂaw in my character."

the system itself. She opted for an
open trial—a right rarely invoked—
and so provided an unusual glimpse into the
workings of the honor court. The secrecy
issue grew even larger with the subsequent
l’olynice case. a closed trial the details of
which were leaked to the press. As a result,
some U.Va. students havebegun tourgethat
all honor-code trials be open. arguing that
the process should undergo public scrutiny
and that juries should have the beneﬁt of
precedents to correct what is generally con-
ceded to be a very erratic dispensation of
justice. “lfit's a student-run~and-adminis-

tive editor ofThe Cavalier Daily.
The Virginia cases also called into ques-
