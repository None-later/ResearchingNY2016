al single sanction: anyone convicted by
the honor court is permanently expelled.
Changes in that rigid system have been
proposed 8 times in the last 12 years, each
time failing to muster the 60 percent student
vote required for passage. Fawcett, in fact,
voted to keep the single sanction the year
before she fell victim to it. The problem is
that the penalty is so extremethat it discour-
ages students from bringing charges or vot-
ing to convict. Law students at Virginia have
called for a separate disciplinary board to
handle their cases, on the ground that expul-
sion from law school is too severe a penalty
for most offenses. But so far, the recent cases
have led only to a more modest change.
Proving “reprehensibility” is no longer re-
quired of the jury, and extenuating circum-
stances are not allowed as evidence.

That is more of a change than is likely at
Washington and Lee, which has had a sin-
gle-sanction honor system since the 1860s;
the idea of “graduated” penalties was de-
bated in the 19705 but rejected. Most col-
leges do have a sliding scale of retribution.
At Hollins, which has a relatively laid—back
code, the debate is whether to give students
who cheat an F rather than a no-credit
withdrawal~a major hardship only for
last-semester seniors. Students found guilty
at Vanderbilt may beexpelled, suspended or
given a failing grade. “We base the penalty
decision on three criteria: the truthfulness of
the student during the hearing and investi-
gation, the premeditation of the act and the
ﬂagrancy of the act," says Honor Council
president Richard Newsome.

 

At Reed College in Oregon, the honor
principle is pervasive but not punitive.
“We're not like Virginia,” says Paula
Rooney, vice president of student services.
“Our students do not sign anything before
an exam. The students just agree to this
trust." That trust is made easier by the
relative lack of importance attached to good
grades at Reed. “Students are more con-
cerned with personal ac-
ademic standards than
the competition to re-
ceive good grades," says
senior Brian Boyl.

Leniency is also part of
thesystem attheU.S.Air
Force Academy, whose
code states: “We will not
lie, steal, or cheat, nor
tolerate among us any-
one who does." Last
spring 30 cadets were
caught in a cheating
scandal involving a phys-
ics exam. Nineteen were
suspended, and a full-
dress review of the honor
system ensued. Cadets
were given amnesty to
confess to any violations, and the faculty
resumed control of thesystem fora year. But
the penalties for honor violations were not
increased. Under the concept of “discre-
tion,” which replaced single sanction in the
19605, sentences range from conﬁnement to
quarters to expulsion. Upperclassmen are
dealt with more harshly than ﬁrst- and sec-

ond-year cadets. Maj. Mike Oonk. com-
menting on the honor code and pilot train-
ing, says: “You can make mistakes early in
your training, and yet if that same thing had
been done later you’d be removed from the
program."

The Air Force system is still too strict to
suit Prof. David Finley at nearby Colorado
College, who attended a military academy

and pri vate trials

as an undergraduate. “I saw individuals
whose lives were damaged to a degree
incommensurate with the fault," he ex-
plains. At Colorado College, the ﬁrst hon-
or violation gets a warning; the second, a
recommendation to the president for
suspension.

No matter what the penalties, honor

 

 

Randlett: ‘It’s up to the individual’

The Student With His Own Proctor

Every undergraduate who enters Prince-
ton University must ﬁrst submit a signed
statement explaining the honor system in

‘ his or her own words and pledging to up-

hold it. Almost every undergraduate, any-
way. Last fall sophomore Wade Randlett
transferred from the University of Califor-
nia, Berkeley, and was allowed to register
without an honor statement. It was a mis-
take on Princeton’s part, but not Randlett’s.
He had deliberately declined to sign a state-
ment because he did not agree with the
Princeton honor system. which covers ex-
aminations and obliges students to report
anyone who cheats. The code, in place since
1893, “is a contract between the faculty and
students whereby students agree to proctor
examinations themselves," explains Honor
Committee chairman Jocelyn Russell.
Randlett says he “wanted to work out a
compromise in which [would pledge that I
would not give or receive help, with no
commitment about taming people in."
First Russell, then the entire Honor Com-
mittee. then president William Bowen tried

to persuade Randlett to sign the pledge, but
he steadfastly refused. And since he had
already matriculated, the university could
not force him to agree. So Princeton worked
out a unique arrangement: Randlett takes
exams in a room apart from his classmates.
under the watch of a graduate student.

A politics major from Lafayette, Calif,
Randlett does not mind the special treat-
ment and makes it clear that he does not
oppose the idea of an honor system. He just
doesn't think Princeton’s is honorable
enough. “What Princeton has now is not
really an honor code," he says. “It’s a self-
proctoring code. Under a real honor code
it's up to the individual’s honor not to
cheat." Randlett‘s fellow students seem to
like their system, to a point: in a Daily
Princetonian poll two years ago, 80 percent
of the respondents approved it over having
faculty proctor the exams—and 90 percent
said they had never cheated. But 55 percent
said they would not report a friend they saw
cheating—and 33 percent said they would
not report anyone.
