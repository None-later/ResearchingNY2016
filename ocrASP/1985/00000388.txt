EDUCATION

codes are effective only if the students
believe in them. That seems to be the case
most often at smaller schools like Earlham,
a Quaker college with 1,000 students. “The
attitude here is if you cheat you’re only
hurting yourself,” says junior Melissa Tull.
who was amazed at the difference after
transferring from much larger Purdue.
Most of the cases that reach the honor
court at Hollins are reported by facul-
ty because, observes junior Stuart Morris.
"friends don’t turn friends in.” Reluctance
to report a violation is also a problem at
Vanderbilt, where 22 percent of students
surveyed last year admitted that they had
knowingly violated the honor code. “Most
of the students who call would like to turn
someone in," says Newsome, “but they
don’t want to have to go to the hearings."
The students may not want to be identiﬁed
as “squealers,” but without a direct accu-
sation, no case can be pursued. One Reed
student insists she has no such qualms.
having confronted and reported a class-
mate she saw cheating. “It doesn't matter
that I am not liked by the other student,"
she says. “It was my job. You must be
willing to sacriﬁce for the beneﬁt of the
entire community."

What good does an honor code do? The

answer varies according to the institution
and the individual. "You learn to value
learning for what it is. rather than where it
will take you,” says Earlham junior Ana
Sanchez. At Virginia, the code is welded
into the school’s tradition: it came into being
in 1836, after a professor was mortally
wounded by a student rioter. The professor
had reportedly recognized his assailant but
insisted to his death that it was up to the
student’s peers to adjudicate. “The honor
system is the one thing that makes the uni-
versity different from other places," says
Raymond Bice, secretary of the Board of
Visitors. But most ofall, the code stands for
clear-cut personal standards in a world
where they have often grown blurry around
theedges. Vanderbilt honor adviser Sandlin
recalls a recent graduate who asked the
university to take back his diploma because
he had cheated on an exam. No action was
taken. “Someone who is bothered enough to
bring back his diploma has had ample pun-
ishment," explains Sandlin. “A lot of peo-
ple would say he was crazy. It's obvious,
though, thathe’s gota lifelongconception of
honesty that I think will serve him well."
