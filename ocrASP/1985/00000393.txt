Only four protesters turned up Saturday night to
demonstrate against the Brian DePaimaﬁlm Body Dou-
ble, but organizers say all they wanted was to raise cam- V
pus awareness about pornography's cf feet on women. so

large numbers WEI! unnecessary.

AccOrding to Ken Dornbaum, co-chair of Coalition
Against Pornography (CAP). the protest was planned to
be "low key" because of qUestions regarding the por-

nographic content of the ﬁlm.

“it is very controversial whether this film is true por-

 

" Sm’al l~'ral'ly assai ls "

, nography or not,” Dornbaum said. “but it deﬁnitely
depicts violence against women." He added that at this
time women‘s safety on campus is questionable and power drill being held at waist level byaman. “its theme
showing this ﬁlm is irreSponsible." -

CAP co-chair Wendy Cervi explained further the
reasons for such a small protest turnout. “it was badly
planned because we have work pressures and end of
semester burn-out." she said.

However. Cervi said that any form of protest would in-
still their message. “As long as one person showed up
people that are going to see the movie will know that it
contains women hatred." she said.

The woman hatred that Cervi refers to is a scene in
which a pornographic model and actress is killed with a

centers around the killing of an erotic dancer," she said.

The other protesters agreed with Cervi. “in this ﬁlm
pornography is the theory and rape is the practice.’ said
Brian Van Grol. a protester. He explained that one out of
every three women will be raped in their life. attributing
many of the crimes to pornography.

Feminist Alliance (FA) chair Masrisa Del Monaco said
members from her group did not attend the demonstra-
tion because of previous plans. Events were held both
nights beforehand. she said. and FA was in the middle of
planning for a ﬁlm to be shown on campus. “We had
other things planned." she explained.

Campus pornography is. however. a major concern for
FA, Del Monaco said. “It (pornography) gives us
negative images of women and how they should be
Heated.” she explained.

According to Lisa Feerick. Director of University
Cinemas. the protest raised the question of what exactly is
pornography. “The film is not legally pornographic."
she said, “and i am unsure of CAP's definition 01'
pornography."

She explained that Body Doble is qualitatively similar
to two Alfred Hitchcock movies." Feerick added that the
cinematography of the film is also impeccable.

Several students who saw Body Double also questioned
the grounds for protest. “The movie was not por.
nographic in any way." said Ellen Blanchette. a graduate
student. "it depicts violence but many movies do that."
she added.

Feerick agreed. saying "ifyou judge a film by weighing
the inference of violence it will definitely cause
problems."

Bill Speidel. a SUNYA student seeing the movie for the
second time, said, “If they are going to protest anything
they should be protesting Clockwork Orange." He ex-

~ The less than overwhelming
support. SUNYA students
demonstrated in the last Student
Association of the State Universi-
ty (SASU) referendum is forcing
campus organizers to consider
steps to improve their group's
presence.

The referenda passed with 62
percent of the vote. allowing
SASU to receive $4 per student
per year through the student ac-
tivity fee. and increase of Si.

However SASU's victory was
narrow when compared to the
other votes on the ballot two
weeks ago. in other referenda, 85
percent of the voters supported a
nuclear freeze. while 76 percent
and 69 percent voted for a man-
datory activity fee and for con»
tinued funding of the New York
Public interest Research Group
(NYPlRG). respectively. in fact.
SASU received only two percent
more that the minimum percent
of votes needed to make the
referendum binding.

Recentlyselected SASU
delegate Amy Korcen said she was
“surprised that SASU did not
receive as much student support
as NYPlRG" since SASU is a
“student organization for
students' rights on campus while
NYPlRG deals with other issues
as well."

SASU president Sue Wray also
expressed disappointment at the
election. saying. "62 percent is
not what I wanted to see."

Wray said she felt SASU could
have benefittcd from more
visibility and hopes to achieve
that in the future by "working on
issues like 2i. divestment,
etcetera, and by doing more work
in the academic area."

Saying that she saw the
NYPtRO victory as a sign that
“students are concerned with

..   "ago:th ~

themselves-as students, citizens,
‘ and consumers." Wray' added
'that the controversy over the
NYPlRG fee may have lowered
support for SASU because
students “took a second look at
giving extra money to
organizations.” .

Wray said she “sees a problem
in student perception of SASU.
They see it as paying four dollars
a year and waiting to Leap the
benefits of SASU's work, but we
are only as strong as the people
involved.” '

“There is a .core group," said
Wray, “but that group is only
partially effective without the
backing of students. Our force is
the numbers behind us, and in
this way we are effective."

Stresslng SASU's dependence
on student support. Wray said
that "SASU's work directly af-
fects students and its issues are
decided by students." She added
that SASU ‘needs to let students
know what SASU is. how to get
involved. and what 'thc issues
are."

Koreen also said that SASU
could have done better in the elec-
tion and poimed to a lack of
publicity as a major reason for its
less-than-imprcssive showing. She
said she felt the lack of an en-
dorsement form the ASP was pro-
bably a factor. .

The Albany Student Press en~
dorsement board voted to reject
the fee increase. writing in their
annual Elections Supplement.
“SASU has done very little to
deserve an extra buck. Although
we are strongly in favor of the
organization itself. Wt: don't think
students should vote in favor of
the Increase."

SASU Communications Direc-
tor Evclinc MacDougali said the
election went “pretty well" and
added that if the group had had
“more bodies to go door knock-

SAying that SASU seeks to
“work more directly with
students on campus." Koreen saw
the increase in funding as
beneficial in improving both the
group's image and effectiveness.

According to Koreen. the extra
money will be used in three major
programs. First, a “Stewards
Program" will be set up in which
“stipended interns will work on-

campus to promote activism."

who added that the network will
connect all SUNY campuses to
SASU offices via computer and
will aid in the transfer of

‘and housing to allow them to be
more effective on campus."
Pointing out SASU's past and
present concerns, Koreen said
that the organization will con-
tinue to work against tuition in-
creases. hikes in the drinking age.
and budget cuts in education fun-

information.

Koreen said that the third

Wilson reward fund picks

SUNYA students. still maintaining hope that

some clues may be found as to the whereabouts
of student Karen Wilson. have collected over
5! .930 to add to a reward fund of $5.000 already
established by members of the State Assembly.

Wilson‘s mother. Barbara Shoemaker. and
Marc Foti. Wilson's boyfriend, will tnake the ex~
net amount of the reward fund public Wednes-
day at a press conference in the Legislative Office
Building at i:00 pm.

So far. Foti has calculated the size of the stu-
dent fund to be about $1,930. “not including a
$l.000 pledge made by UAS (Universtiy Aux-
iliary Services)."

Foti said the money offered by UAS first must
be ttpprovcd by the Board of Directors. “it's just
a technicality." he added.

Other contributors include the Senior Class
Council. which pledged $1.000, Student Associa-
tion (SA) pledged $500. State Quad pledged
$150. Seneca Hall donated $200 and Chapel
House asdded $80 to the cause.

Last week. another reward fund was set up by
Assembly member Sam Colman, posting $5.000

colleagues.
