Professorthreatened over animal experiments I

(CPS) In one' of the more ominous
wrinkles of the growing campus animal
rights movement. a death threat in early
February forced a University of
California-San Diego professor to cancel a
surgery class.

Alarmed university administrators. who
claim the threat is the fourth against
UCSD faculty members in recent months.
have assigned bodyguards to Dr. A.R.
Moossa. the professor who had to cancel
the class in which student learn surgical
procedures using anesthesized dogs.

Seeking to minimize the impact of the
threats and disruptions. Moossa and ad-
ministrators are withholding comment
about the incidents.

But prominent animal rights activists
disclaim the threats. and contend the
movement to protect animals involved
research experiments. which has spread
rapidly around the nation in the last three
years. is not turning to violence agianst
people. '

“Everything we‘ve done is peaceful."
insisted Alex Pacheco. chairman of People
for the Ethical Trcattnent of Animals
(PETA). one of the nation‘s largest animal
rights groups.

“Humans are animals. too." he said.
“and no animal or human should be
harmed."

PETA members nevertheless celebrated
the cancellation of the surgery class.

“We challenge the belief that we can
use. kill or cut up animals because we want
to." Pacheco explained.

“The situation is getting tnore drastic all
the time." he observed. “We need to take
off the gloves and hit as hard as we can.
it's not a game.”

The activists argued it‘s necessary
because their opponents took off the
gloves long ago.

“It‘s a mistake to think animal rightsac-
tivists don‘t get their share of intimida-
tion." added Gary l’rancione. University

of Pennsylvania law professor and animal
rights proponent. ’

“We just learn to live wit it." he said.
“Yott can't let it ttpsct you." Francionc

l-Icad injuries I.ab.

Administrators denied I’ETA‘s claim
the lab violates state and federal animal
research laws.

They charged the activists themselves
acted ttnethically when they stole a
\ideotape of lab experiments to make a
film coudctuning animal research.

But such tensions are rising on many

campuses. Activists from the radical
Animal Liberation Front raided San
Diego's City of Hope Hospital in

December. freeing nearly 100 animals and
seizing copies of research files.

The stolen files showed that more than
50 percent of the hospital's lab animals
died “before they wee supposed to."
I’E'I'A's Pacheco said. “They died from
things like negligence. bleeding. overdoses
and choking to death."

In Arizona. five Animal Rights Coali-
tiott members were convicted in January of
criminal trespassing dttring a University
Medical Center sit-in. University of
Arizona officials. however. gave in to ac-
tivists' demands for an animal rights
representative on the school‘s animal-care
eotnmittee.

Cal-Berkeley animal rights proponents
have provoked two recent United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) in-
vestigations of animal care labs.

The USDA and the National Institute of
Health. ovcrsccrs of animal-use research.

and a broadened role for campus animal
care committees.

inadequate. and said university

death threats make researchers cautious
and angry. and can even cripple valuable
research. said Greg Stickrod. Unviersity of
Oregon animal services lab director.

At Oregon. an August PETA-sponsored
demonstration and subsequent break-ins
and vandalism have “led to a policy of in-
creased security and restricted access."
Stickrod reported.

“There were always some closed
research areas." he added. “but the pro-
tests have caused us to adopt a ‘closed col-
ony' policy."

Incidents now occur “about every six
weeks.“ Stickrod said. “Sometimes it's
very ntinor. but it eliminates some research
and it makes us feel bad."

Stickrod admitted the university “is
listed as one of 200 institutions in the US.
as having repeated major or minor viola-
tions of USDA regulations."

But “our violations are extremely
minor." he added. “Things like a

According to Dornbaum. Clockwork
Orange was not protested because of past
controversies about the movie. He explain-
ed that it was once rated ‘X’ but scenes
were cut out and now the movie is rated
‘R'.

According to Feerick the protest helped
University Cinemas. “At this point my
group is concerned with trying to get a lot
of opinions of peoples' definitions of por-
nography." She added that the group is
trying to figure out where to draw the
line.“CAP is showing us how some
students feel about this. obviously they
don't represent all students but they do
represent some." Feerick said.

Ccrvi agreed that CAP is working with
University Cinemas. “We are helping
them recognize the existence of various
viewpoints on campus." she said.

Stickrod claimed protestors distort the
facts by “pulling records through the

Freedom of infortnation Act and saying .

‘these institutions are being cruel to
animals.‘ " ._

“We really object to the way they use in-
formation and statistics." he said.

“The only way to prove or disprove
anything is to open up the labs.” PETA's
Pacheco said. "lots of people are defen-
ding eareers. They'll come out and lie
about what they're doing." -

Activists said nearly every college and
hospital in the V country does animal
research involving “fairly big money and
large government grants." .

“There are very serious questions raised
by this research." Penn's Franeione said.
“And it ends up jeopardizng legitimate
research." Cl

Fecrick said that Cinemas is not going to
stop showing ‘R' rated films but that no
‘X' rated films are scheduled for next
semester.

“Not showing ‘R' rated films would
prevent us from showing Breakfast Club
and Beverly Hills Cop, which we have
planned." she said. ’

Feerick stressed that Cinemas needs in-
put from students. “We need to know that
this campus wants to see and doesn’t want
to see," she said. _

Del Monaco discounted rumors that her
group had avoided tha prostest so as not to
embarass Feerick. who was up for reelec-
tion to her post. Said Del Monaco, "I
don‘t know anything about that."

Anne Marie Lamoy was elected Cinemas
director at group elections held Sunday
night. El

Students-raise millions toraid drought victims

A , New York, NY
(CPS) Rock stars aren‘t the only people
raising money to aid starving drought vic-
tims in Ethiopia and other African
nations.

Since November. when at NBC News
film of starving children masde'the Africa
famine a‘ bigger issue here, s‘tudent gorups
have raised thousands of dollars through
relief funds like Oxfam. UNICEF. CARE.
and the Save the Children Federation and.
the American Red Cross. relief officials
say_ i , .
Some students. however. apparently re-
sent the methods charitable organizations
are using to turn them into fundraisers.

But whatever the tactics. “students raise
millions of dollars each year for
charities." said Steve Kinnaird, national
coordinator for the New York City-based
U.S. Committee for,UNICEF’s Campus
Action Program. - ~

The cause, of course. isn’t new.

“UNICEF and the United Nations have
been warning of mass disaster (in Africa)
since 1981." Kinnaird pointed out.

But now “there‘s lots of activity even in
places where no program is in place yet.”
he reported.

Last fall, over l00 campuses joined a na-
tionwide Oxfam fast “to call attention to
world hunger.”

The annual Oxfam event had never
drawn tnore than 40 participating cam-
puses before, and' the pace of activity has
accelerated again this spring.

University of West Florida faculty and
students. for example, held a Third World
Luncheon on April 3. serving participants
either a full dinner or a glass of water.

The meal emphasized Thirid World star-
vastion and unequal food distribution
worldwide, explained Sandra Dickson,
broadcast journalism professor and pro-
gram eoalition member.

“We raised $750 or more for the Oxfam
and Bread for the World programs.” she

said. ‘

in Minnesota. Mankato State Unviersity
students on April 28 will begin a Famine
Relief Week which will include a food and
money drive.

Committee members hope community
organizations also will sponsor fundraising
events that week.

Sigma Tau Gamma fraternity at the
University of Mi550uri-St. Louis held a
“We Are the World" party and auction in
early April, donating all auction proceeds '
and 20 percent of the party door charge to
U.S.A. for Africa.

Students at‘ Dartmouth. Cal-Berkeley.
Harvard. Virginia Poiytcch and the State
University of New York-Albany. among
other campuses. have staged or are plann-
ing fundraising events.

Kinnaird's committee has set up “cam-

The organization. now on some 60 cam-

puses in New York. raises $8.000 at
SUNYA recently when students gave up
one meal. The campus food service
donated the cost of the meal to the group.
which gave the money to UNICEF’s
CARE program.
‘ “UNICEF operates on a ten percent
overhead budget," Kinnaird explained.
"Of combined government and private
donations, more than 90 percent goes to
programs."

In i983. government donations topped
$50 tnillion. and private giving usually
totals between $8 million and $18 million
per year, he,said.

“Obviously it’s a good cause." Scran-
ton‘s Hanchak said. “The pictures of star-
ving kids really get to you."

But those same tactics anger some

students.

“It makes me angry that these organiza-
tions use pictures of dead and dying babies
to make us donate to their causes." stated
Ben Bratman. editorial writer for the
University of Washington’s student paper.
“I really feel these organizations are
marketing themselves as much as they are
trying to save lives."

“We haven‘t taken enough interest in
our own back yard to force our govern-
ment to react to our own starvation pro-
blem," he stressed.

Bratman insisted he means “no callous
disregard or feeling toward the people of
Africa and their plight. Especially the
children."

“But what I‘d like to see is Americans
doing it just because it's right." he said. i]

 

pus ambassador" programs at nearly 60
schools to organize student fundraising,
and hopes to double the number by next
year. _ ‘

Under the program. one student per
campus orchestrates benefits and
cultivates student and faculty support.

“This puts a student group officially on
campus.” Kinnaird explained. “The key is
to reach out to campus organizations to
broaden the base of support."

Pennsylvania’s University of Scranton
ambassador Nick Hanchak said he's “not
doing a hell ofa lot" this semester. but last
fall he and a few organizers raised $2.000
from a jog-a-thon.

“On college eatnpuses there's lots of
energy. and you can raise a lot of money.”
he said. “Some ideas didn't go over too
well. so I'm trying to get some solid pro-
grams for next year."

But some groups are more “grassroots”
than Kinnaird’s organizations, and nearly
as widespread. '
