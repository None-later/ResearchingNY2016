‘Private terrorism‘iinfliets‘
physical, emotional harms

> By Susan Sokol

In the United States a woman is battered
every five seconds. Private terrorism is
committed daily by people who live with
each other and who even profess to love
each other. Battering may occur in dating.
married or homosexual couples, and oc-
cttrs in all racial. econontic and educa-
tional backgrounds. according to Mildred
Pagelow in her book Wotncn - ﬂattering.

ﬂattering is physical assault which
ranges from painful slaps to homicide.
wrote Pagelow. As a violent relationship

continues. attacks become more frequent‘

and prolonged. getting worse over time.
said Pagclow. With that first slap. there is
a lessening of prohibitions so that hitting
becomes easier the second or third time.
said Ginny NiCarthy. author of Getting
Free: A Handbook for Women in Abusive
Relationships. it is estimated that one-
third to forty percent of all women who
are killed are murdered by the men who
"love" them.

’ Batterng refers to physical assault. in-
cluding physical, sexual or emotional at-
tacks. said NiCarthy. A person is a victim
of physical abuse when a partner slaps.
punches. kicks. chokes or uses a weapon to
threaten. NiCarthy added that sexual
abuse ranges from anti-woman remarks to
rape.

Emotional abuse may be some form of
verbal assaults, constant put-downs, or
continual criticism. A partner may
humiliate the victim in public or‘private.
NiCarthy added. According to NiCarthy,
the male partner may be rude and insulting
to the victim's family and friends. often
isolating her from them. He may also con—
trol her economically and may break or
throw out her belongings. added
NiCarthy.

According to Kim Wardrop. Shelter
Coordinator at Unity House‘s Families in
Crisis Program. “a woman can be in an
extremely abusive relationship but has
never been hit." There is usually chronic
psychological and emotional abuse. War-
drop added. The victim may not feel free
to express her opinion. She may have fears
of doing the “wrong thing." She may
develop a low self-esteem. start to feel
depressed. trapped. or powerless. NiCar-
thy said. .

“Domestic violence is deeply rooted in
sexism and sex-speciﬁc roles. Both men
and women become shackled by narrowly
defined social and sexual roles." said War—
drop. Many women receive lower pay than
their male counterparts with the same
education. wrote Pagelow. The justiﬁca-
tion for paying men more is that a man's
career is considered important and mean-
ingful. while a woman's career is con‘
sidcred a whim that supplements her with
pocket money. wrote Michael Kotda in his
book Male Chnuvinism. "Women learn to
judge their success and worth’by the value
of their relationships." Wardrop said.

If a woman is abused by her partner. she
may have a personal sense of failure. She
may feel shame. fear and humiliation. said
Wardrop. t.

She may convince herself that if she had
only done the right thing she wouldn't
have been beaten. At ﬁrst she may try to
change whatever he said “caused” the
violence. wrote Pagelow. ' ‘

He may have beaten her "because" the
dinner was too cold or too hot (“i burned
my mouth“). She may have lost his sock at
the laundromat. She may have spent too
much time with her family. said Wardrop.
Anything may precipitate his anger. she
said. “If a man is going to batter. he's go~
ing to batter regardless." added Wardrop.

In an effort to avoid further violence.
the woman may try to meet all her part-
ner‘s demands. Wardrop added “that the
woman may try to manipulate everything
in the environment. She may get dinner
ready at a certain time. If it upsets him-that
she is spending too much time with her
family. she may break off ties with family
and friends. She becomes isolated while at

the same time she learns there is no way
out." Wardrop said. The male partner
may have ended the victim's relationships
with everyone but himself. explained
Pagelow.

The batterer may threaten the victim if
she sees family of friends. If she makes an
escape attempt- with family. friends or
neighbors. the-violent man may threaten to
endanger those people until they withdraw
their offers ofhelp.'said Pagclow. He may.
have threatened. “lf'you leave. I‘ll kill you
or your parents.“ said Wardrop.

Men are also victimized by sex-specific
roles. Wardrop said. adding that the tradi-
tional male role requires men to be stoic.

Traditionally the only socially accep-
table expression of emotion for men is ag-
gression. said Wardrop. Men are not
taught how to channel and communicate
their emotions. said Wardrop.

Many men are trained into competition.
aggressiveness and taught that violence is
okay. Pagelow wrote. Men who are con-
vinced of their right to dominate and con-
trol women may feel ‘justified in using

“Both men and
women become
shackled by-narrowly
deﬁned social and
sexual roles.”

—— Kim Wardrop

 

force or violence. she added. Until recent-
ly. men considered women their property
who required control. according to NiCar-
thy. in British common law. the “rule of
thumb“ granted men permission to batter
women as long as the whip or rod was no
thicker than a man's thumb. NiCarthy
added.

A batterer may not view his violence as a
problem. if he is married to his victim. he
may feel the marriage license is a cer-
tiﬁcate of ownership -- that she is his pro—
petty, said Wardrop. 1

Henry Yost. Jr. Program Coordinator
at Men’s Coalition Against Battering (M-
CAB) said that many men batter because
they learn about violence as a solution.
When they feel themselves losing control
over a situation. when the men don't have
other social skills to use instead. their
violence restores a sense of adequacy. said
Yost. adding that battering works. The
woman who has been abused will try to
placate him. . - . .

Yost continued that control is very
specific to the relationship. He may try to
control other people around him but feels
he has no control over his emotions. Yost
explained. .The batterer will use the
psychological defense mechanisms of
denial and minimization. Yost explained.
He may say “she bruises easily“ or “she
hit me first and l was defending myself."
added Yost. '

Actually. although he feels he has no
control over his anger. a great deal of con-
trol is being exercised. added Yost. The
damage would be more severe if they were
out of control. Yost added. Frequently a
“decision” is made where to hit and how
(Le. punch/slap). The batterer may fre-
quently justify his violence by blaming his
partner. wrote Pagelow. "He doesn't have
a very realistic idea of what she feels." said
Yost.

These men can have extremely suc-
cessful careers. said Wardrop. There are
other batterers who cannot hold down ts
job. and don't have successful friendships.
Wardrop.:tdded. Some are very guilt1r’ld-

den. some boast and-brag about it.’ said
Wardrop. These men may be very charm-
ing. people may react with'disbelief saying.
“Charlie is such a sweet guy. He wouldn't
hurt a fly." said Wardrop. She added.
"It's impossible to tell whether a man is an
abuser based solely on how he looks. talks
or acts."

The battered woman and her partner go
through a 3-stage cycle. according to
Lenore Walker's book Battered Women.

First. tension builds. She may try to please!

him or stay out of his way. Next, violence
erupts. The third stage includes remorse
and apologies. He may promise. "i love
you. I‘ll never do it again." Wardrop said.
the woman wants to believe she will never

t suffer abuse again, that he will change and

remain loving. This is one reason why
women will start proceedings and then
drop the charges. Wardrop said. It's very
confusing for the woman. said Yost. She
remembers that side of him when he was
very caring. He too may care about her.
Yost said. Frequently they love each other.
said Yost. The relationships are not much
different from. other relationships where
there is not violence in which marital
satisfaction is low, added Yost.

Very few of these men seek help on their
own, said Wardrop. it is only after
repeated leavings and broken promises
that these women press charges, said War-
drop. The man may only get help ifshe has
left or is threatening to leave. which
precipitates his having to do something
about his problem. Or he is attending
under court order. Yost added.

The batterer is responsible for his own
violence. But both are responsible for the
state of the relationship which has built-in
problems besides the violence. Yost added.
The female may inﬂict pain by personal at-
tacks and verbal abuse, said Yost. That's
part of the escalating process. added Yost.

When the woman does try to introduce
change. she may find that couple-

counseling. ministers and courts may be
more concerned with I “preserving the
family at any cost." said Wardrop. If she
has the man arrested. he may be released in
a few hours threatening to “get her." said
Wardrop. adding that the woman may fear
reprisal. another reason why many women
will start proceedings then drop them.
Wardrop said that the shelter will support
women in whatever decision they make —
to stay or leave. She added. the victim
needs to be empowered so she can deter-
‘mine her own destiny.
If you are a victim of abuse. what can

you do?

Have photographs taken of your in-
juries at the police station.

Police reports as well as emergency
room documentation can be very impor-
tant if you press charges.
