told police he saw a woman fitting
Wilson's description walking the streets of
Wilmington. Vermont.

New York- State police. in conjuncion
with Vermont police. conducted a search
starting front Route 2 in Troy and exten-

no further clues were discovered.

Police have not been able to come up
with any tangible clues as to Wilson‘s
whereabouts since she disappeared on
March 27. over a month ago.

Wilson is believed to have been last seen

Pitching isn't the only talent Wendy Wllllams possesses.

 
 

'she's Albany State’s .super

pitcher. .
With all this going on in her

 
    

career.

Williams rushed back to her
room. took a shower. and ate.
making it over the Campus
Center just in time for the
interview.

Williams didn’t even mention
the no-hitter. "I thought l had
one. but one of the games was on-
ly five innings." reflected
Williams yesterday. “Someone

‘ said they had a hit in the first inn-

ing. 1 found out the next day. It's
my first one. I was pretty excited.
A lot of games I‘ve had a no-
hitter going into the seventh inn-
ing." continued the pitcher. “But

'l'd give up a hit in the seventh.”

Williams is a junior majoring in
Medical Technology. She came to
Albany State for this program
and because it does have a soft-
ball program. She comes across as
a very friendly yet modest young
woman. from a small town. “My
freshman class here had more
people in it than my whle town."
said Williams of Weedsport. the
town she graduated high school
from.

What you can’t tell about
Williams is that until the sixth
grade she lived all over the US.
and even abroad. Her father was
in the Navy for more than 20
years until he retired and settled
his family in Weedsport. a small
town west of Syracuse. Williams
was born in California and has

around military people. It was
pretty neat. They're all very
friendly: you have to be consider-
ing you make new friends every
couple of years."

Williams feels this atmosphere
helped to make to make her such
a friendly person. This
background also helps with the
discipline she needs for what she
does. especially practicing pit-
ching while everyone else is out
having fun.

On any summer’s evening
you‘ll find Williams, after a full
days work. out behind Dutch
Quad pitching. Her daily
workout. which lasts about a half
an hour. begins by jogging to
warm up, then she stretches out
before the pitching ritual begins.

Williams, with her three or four
softballs. picks a spot pretty close
to the concrete wall and starts to
throw in her windmill style. At
first. she's close enough so that
the ball bounces right back to
glove. rarely hitting the ground.
As she continues to work her way
back. increasing the distance bet-
ween herselfand the wall. the ball
now rolls back to her. sometitncs
just making it. Finally. by the
time she is at lhe normal pitching
distance. she throws all the soft-
balls. one after another. goes to
collect them. and starts again.

“All the summer teams make
comments." said Williams.

The fact that onlookers involv-
ed in their own softball games‘
take notice of her. says a lot
about the impact of Williams’
presence on the softball field.

Williams led her high school
team in the five years she pitched
for them. winnning the sectionals
and helping the club to an
undefeated record in her senior
year.

She never pitched until seventh
or eigth grade, despite the fact
that she grew up around softball.
Her dad played in the Navy.
where he too was a pitcher.

“I've been around it all my
life." said Williams. “I‘ve been
catching for my dad since i was
little. He never pushed me into it.
but when I decided I wanted to
pitch. he worked a lot with me."

The next step in William‘s pit-
ching career came when she was
at Albany State. It was here that
she acquired three types of pit-
ches: a rise_ball. drop ball. and
change up. Assistant Coach Jack
Coons helped the Wendy out a
lot. both in pitching and
concentration.

Continuing in making her
presence on the field known as
she had done in high school, she
led the l4-4 Danes into the State
Championships. Her freshman
year she pitched 54 innings. col-
lected 28 strikeouts. ll! base on
