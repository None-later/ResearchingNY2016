STAFF I|‘Ri TER .

For the second time in ten
weeks. the Albany State. men's
track team failed to win ameet

because of the absence of many‘

key members. Though the. Danes
fell to Binghamton 'Saturday.
their excellent middle-distance
and jump performances enabled
them to beat Hamilton College.
70-54.

Binghamton, which scored 88
points on its own track. had only
beaten Albany once in eighteen
years. The split gives the Purple
and Gold a 4-2 record.

The Danes first experienced a
mass straying before an indoor
meet at. Plattsburgh last
February. A disqualification in
that meet's last event appeared‘to
give Albany a win over the lowly
Cardinals. but the official's deci-
sion was reversed a week later
resulting in an Albany loss.

Missing from the. squad were
All-American 'weightman Marc
Mercurio, top short dash man
Mike Riggins rind other potential
scorers. Some Danes were in-

I jurcd. one missed the bus and one

was absent for unknown reasons.
Of those at the meet. Jim Erwin
may have felt the tnost glad that

he went. The senior broke the-

four minute barrier en route to
winning the metric mile in 3154.7.
His previous best time was 4:00. 1.
According to Erwin. the
psychological barrier of “sub-
four" had been a “pain in my
ass."

Craig Parlato may now be ex-
periencing that feeling. in placing
second. he also ran a personal

best. but just missed dipping «

under" four minutes. He ’rti'n

sonal record by placing second in
the BOO-meter run with a l:56.4
clocking. "The sophomore has

in all of his outdoor races this
season despite a very light train-

team on any given day." said
Theresa Longhi. “It's not a good
idea to start bragging. it's more
important to concentrate on
winning."

The crew is now concentrating
on Saturday‘s upcoming New
York Metre Regatta. which will
be held at the New York Athletic
Club. Albany State will meet For-
dham. St. John’s. Canisius, Skid-

season is by assessing team im-
provement. This is where Zaloom
is happiest with 1985. “.We're a
much more complete team now
than in the beginning of the
season," he said. “Well there's
still a chance. Oneonta must beat
llingltamton in both games."

Craig Barbieri. a freshman. ran

Paul Mance added his triple

jump win to the list of “bests.” '

His leap of 45’2 3/4" is his
longest of the year. Ajay Gupta
was third with a 4l’6” jump. The
duo repeated their placings in the
long jump. Mance soared 2l‘8

"Ajay hadn't jumped in a cou-
ple of weeks because, of an in-
jury." said Coach Bob Munsey.
“we‘re really tickled with him."

ed “runner of the meet" honors
for his hurdles double‘. His time
of 57.8 was sufficient for second
place in the 400-meter in-
termediates. while 15.9 was good
enough for fourth in the
ll0-meter-highs. Both times were
personal bests for the freshman.

Finishing one place ahead of
Blzovi in both races was junior
Bruce Van Tassel. who is recover-
ing from a foot injury. The An-

56.9 and l5.8.

Albany's .iohn Reilly was the
400-meter dash winner. Despite
hamstring problems. Reilly .has
performed well in the “quarter”
throughout the season. His time
at Binghamton was 50.2. He also
placed second in the ZOO-meter
dash (22.6). -

The Danes’ distance crew con-
tinues to shine. They grabbed two
first places Saturday.

John Glaser's Steeplechase win
was the more unexpected of the
two victories. In keeping with the
theme of the afternoon. he ran his
best-ever time. 9:510 to qualify
for the state championships.

Ed McGill won the 5,000-meter
run in l5:12.l. Kevin Shcchan

Tim Hoff volunteered to fill one
of the many gaps left by absent
teammates. He responded with a
solid 32:54 for third place in his
first 25-lapper. Steve 'Ravnitzky
was fourth (34:52).

The Danes failed to score in
seven events.

The team travelled to
Hamilton. N.Y. Wednesday for
the Colgate Relays. The highlight
of the meet was the distance
medley's second place finish
behind Syracuse. The team of
Parlato. Blcttc, Paul Fauty and
Hoff combined for a 10:29.
