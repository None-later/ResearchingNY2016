were earned, which calculated to
a l.04 earn run average.

As much as her presence was
felt that year and this season, her
absence last season was felt even
more as the Danes plummetted to
a losing record.

Williams decided last year that
she didn't have the time for soft-
ball, considering her heavy course
load. A medical technology stu-
dent. she had three lab courses
last spring and was studying for
the NY State EMT test. which she
passed the day of Mayfest. “You
do what you have to do," said the
pitcher. "I went absolutely crazy
last year: i was so uptight over the
littlest things. it was from having
too much time to waste.”

Williams presence is not just
felt on the field. This interview
was interrupted by Bob Luckey of
the University Press Service, who
had taken photos of softball that
afternoon. When he realized it
was Williams who was sitting
there, he said, “Boy. you pitch
fast. How fast is that? Have you
ever clocked it?"

The pitcher. apprehensive as
usual about talking about herself.

pitch was once clocked in the fall
by a UFO officer at 55-60 tnph.

The pitcher doesn't seem to mind
pitching all of two doubleheaders,
although she admits she
sometimes gets tired, 'especially
mentally.

"it would be nice tohave a
relief once in a while," she said.
“it's kind of wierd. l’ve always
been doing all the pitching. l’d
probably go crazy sitting on the
bench though."

This season, Williams has pit-
ched “4 V: innings, facing 4ll
batters in_ which she has given up ’
52 hits. 29 runs have been scored
against the team. She has given up
25 bases on balls, has l05

average of 0.67 thru Saturday.

ference, ‘Wendy is obviously the

“She was unrecruited. We didn’t
even know she was. coming here.
You hold your breath with people
like this that someone else won't
recruit her now."

Rhenish continued," She’s
very loyal and supportive which is
indicative of 'wh'at’she‘is doing
here with 5 Quad and all. i think
she likes it here. She enjoys what
she's doing and that makes a
difference."

Williams will be at Albany
Medical School next year but is
pretty sure they'll be able to work
around softball so she can play.
Even if she can’t, the mild man-
nered young lady, who is always
on the go, is bound to find
something to ﬁll up her spare
time.

"l’d definitely be bored if I
wasn't doing all ofthcse things,"
said Williams. l]

Bob Lucitey didn't pick up a camera until the end of his
sophomore year. . I

That might not seem particularly shocking. unless
you're in the habit of reading ASP photo credits, or are
familiar with .who’s running this year's Torch. In fact,
one's ﬁrst' reaction might be ‘who cares?"

Something one mightfind more interesting, though. is
the fact that Luckey is going to spend this summer work-
ing as an intern for Sports Illustrated. Taking pictures.
Put simply, Luckey is probably” one of the best student
photographers to come out of SUNYA in the last billion
years. _ ‘

L “i think it's a credit to Robert Luckey." said Luckey's
coworker Dave Isaac, “that a student from a non-
photography school can get an internship like this one."

“I found out about it two weeks ago," Luckey related,
“and at ﬁrst. i didn't believe it. [thought it was a joke or

_ something. Then l got the letter."

“The letter" contained the ofﬁcial list of the Time-Life
Corporation's summer interns. and the school's they were
attending. About midway down the list, between Harvard
and Stanford, SUNYA's name stuck out like a sore
thumb in What otherwise seemed like a list of Ivies afthe
East.

“It‘s a'testa/ment to his personal ability," said Dean
Chang. Managing Editor of the Albany Student Press,
for which Luckey does the majority of his work. Luckey
started shooting with University Photo Service, the grotv I
that provides photographs to the Torch and the AS. n
his junior year. He'd had two months experience with a
camera. '

“l was really bored with Poly Sci." Luckey explained,
“and the summer after my sophomore year i was just
bumming around with nothing to do, so i picked up one
of my dad’s cameras, and headed out to the beach and

TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 1985 El ALBANYSTUDENT PRESS  '23

just started shooting."

Luckey's father, another Bob Luckey, has been a
photographer with Newsday for 20 years. “He took me in
to the ofﬁces and let me use the stuff there," Luckey said,
“and l started getting really into it."

Luekey got into it to the point where he's now the
lEditorJn-Chief of this year's Torch, and a very respected
sports photographer for the ASP.

“The secret is to get in the trenches,” Luckey said.
"You have to have experienced things that students have.
you have to have the same frustrations or joys. You take
better pictures when you understand your subject."

Although Luckey's sports photography is what he is
best known for (and is, presumably, what got him an in-
ternship with Sports Illustrated), he maintains that he is
not a sports photographer. _

“A lot of people have classiﬁed me as a ‘sports
photographer,’ ” Luckey acknowledged, “but what I

really like is shooting people. There’s so much out there

in the way of different sorts of people at the university.
It's almost like a small city. . .differcnt types of people
and events."

“The thing about sports," he conceded, “is that
there's . . .well. there’s something at stake. i mean. i
know it sounds cliched, but allthat stuff about the thrill
of victory and the agony of defeat offers a lot in the way
of pictures."

Thrill and agony aren’t the only ingredients to
Luckey’s sports photos, though. in the past, he's tried
things like setting a camera at grass level for a football
game, or attaching one behind a glass backboard at a
basketball game to try and get good rebound shots.

' “He's very demanding of himself. and of others,"
lsaac noted.

As Torch editor, Luckey puts in over 40 hours a week.
“For most of tltesc people (at UPS) this is a hobby. an ex-
tracurricular. l‘m very serious about it."

UPS hotographor Bob Luckey wlll be packing his
gear or Sports Illustrated this summer.

“l've covered the Democratic Presidential primaries,"
Luckey said, “l've been to the NCAA track champion-
ships, l‘ve freelanccd for the Daily News, Netvsday, and
the Post. Taking pictures. . .it deﬁnitely teaches you
something."

Just what it ltas taught Lttckey — is still teaching him,
perhaps, -- is something he himself isn't really sure of.
“Look at the university," he continued. “l've been out
there taking pictures for a while."

weekend results mixed for Albany stickmen

By Cathy Errlg
EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

Earlier in the season, Albany
State head. lacrosse coach Rick
Flanders said that his team played
thier best games on Saturdays.
But after last Wednesday's win
against Division l Stone and
yesterday’s game against Oneon-
ta, he may just change his mind.

For after losing Saturday’s
home game against Buffalo State,
22-10, the Dane stickmen re-
bounded yesterday to solidly
defeat Oneonta, 12-5. Their
record now stands at 3-8, with
two games remaining.

“Against Buffalo we had a real
good first quarter," said
Flanders. “We played a better
quality of lacrosse than did our
very good opponent. Then, in the
second quarter we played very
tentatively and the roof fell in."

  

 

   

assisted by Rick Trizano, and

The Danes were ahead going in-
to the second quarter, 5—3, with a
trio of goals by scoring leader
Dave Cerny,“ a goal by Gary
Friedman and a goal by John
Norris. However. Buffalo's
defense held them scoreless for
the entire second quarter. during
which their offense added seven
goals to their total. Going into the
second half, it was Buffalo 10,
Albany 5.

“Offensively, we had no con-
sistency," said Flanders, “and
defensively we gave up easy goals
clue to people being out of posi-
tion. They scored when we were a
man up."

The second halfdidn’t go much
better for the Danes, as Buffalo
scored eight times in the third
quarter to the Danes two, making
the score l8-7. Jim McPartlin,

 

Friedman, assisted by Cerny, ad-
ded the Dane goals.

in the fourth quarter. Buffalo
was again dominant. outscoring‘
the Danes four to three. For the
Danes, it was McPartlin. who
scored twice, and Cerny. scoring
once, who brought the teams'
ﬁnal total to lo.

Things went better for the
Danes yesterday. on what was,
accordng to Flanders. a day
meant for lacrosse.

“it was great out there with the
sun and all," said Flanders. “Not
too windy and all the spectators
got to catch some rays as they
cheered us on."

The cheering started early in
the game as the Danes totally
dominated Oneonta. scoring
seven goals in the first half while
shutting out their opponent en-
tirely. First quarter goals were

scored by Ccrnym and Trizano.
and second quarter goals were ad-
ded by Brad Rabinowitz. Fried-
man. Cerny and two by
McPartlin.

“The first half we played solid,
unselfish lacrosse," said
Flanders. “We beat them
athletically as well as by playing
better lacrosse."

The second half was solid, if
unspeetacular. as well for the
Danes. Trizano. McPartlin, and
Friedman scored for the Danes in
the third ‘ quarter, after which
Oneonta added three goals of its
own to bring the score to 10-3 go-
ing into the final quarter.

Oneonta again matched the
Danes in scoring in the fourth
quarter with both teams collecting
two goals. Gary Weisncr, assisted
by Lloyd Haymes, and Cerny,
assisted by McPartlin, scored for
Albany.

“Going into the game we knew
we needed .a win." said
McPartlin, who is presently sc-
cond in team scoring. “lt‘s com-
ing down to the end for l3
seniors. All around. things estmc
together today. i think you need a
philosophy cours: to figure out
why things only come together oc-
cassionally for this tcatr."

“We saw sotnc nice things out
there," said Flanders of the
game. “The midfield line of
Jason Hurley, Steve Barnett and

Chris Gaines played good lacrosse
at both ends of the field. l'm ex-
cited about that because they're
all underclassmen."

Flanders was also pleased over
the goalie situation. “All of our
goalies did a good job out there;
Pete Betschart did a great backup
iob for senior Al Cornfield who
had fourteen saves. and he'll be
an outstanding goalie in upcom-
ing games. He's our goalie of the
future."

“We also showed our bench
strength today, our cavalry." said
McPartlin. “On defense. Joe Sac-
comano and Brian ‘Milton'
Robinson showed that they know
how to play defense. That gave
the offense more con fidence, it let
us feel that we could have some
lct downs and did not have to
worry about having to come back .
and turn the game around. if we
lost the ball, the defense would
come through for us."

The Dane sti-:kmett‘s next game
will be played at Colgate Univer-
sity on Wednesday, and their
final game will be Saturday at
hotnc against Potsdam.

"The most important thing is
that we play our next two games
well." said Saccomztno. “We
have to play complete games as
well as we’ve shown we can play
In spurts. We have to prove it to
ourselves that we can still do it."

both her very first and second no-
hitter. To date. Williams has two
no-hitters and five shutouts this
season.

“She pitched those two no-
hittcrs both on the same day."
said Rhenish. "That‘s an
accomplishment."

Williams had six strikeouts lit
the first game as Albany took a
2—0 lead in the first inning. They
followed that with a rttn iii the
fourth and then five in the third
to win the game 8-0.

Tltey dominated the second
game evcti more. winning 11-0 in
only five innings.

With their ll-S-l record, the
Danes face Russell Sage on
Wednesday in a doubleheader to
be 1" ml at Sage. “l'tn trying to
get 'i V coverage for that game."

“Considering that at the first
day of practice we didn't have

Rhenish. “it's amazing about

since then." 1:]
