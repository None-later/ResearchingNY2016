‘ Wanted: hero.

Commentary by: Tom Missel

Babe Ruth is probably doing somer-
saults in his grave. Joe Louis and Jesse
Owens. too. '

The American sports hero. once an un-
wavering ﬁxture of Middle Americana.
has become an endangered‘species. Say it
ain't so. Joe.

I. He won't talk. for fear his words will
be mangled by a merciless press.

2. He can't talk because he's functionally
illiterate. "Dick and Jane" seems like
“War and Peace" to him.

3. His agent or coach won't let him talk.

4. Or. he's simply unable to talk because
he's doing 3 - S in Leavenworth for: a.)
shaving points in last year's Toilet Bowl.
b.) raping his next door neighbor. c.) traf-
ficking cocaine. d.) all of the above.

Money-mania and media madness have
runneth amuck. creating mongol hordes
of spoiled rotten brats.

Blue collar identification has vanished.
lost somewhere between illegal college
recruiting and the arbitration table.
Thirty-six MaJor League Baseball players
earn over $1 million per year. Oops! That
should be "make." not "earn." ‘

And who cares if George Brett has hem-
moroids. ‘cept maybe George and his pro-
ctologist. How "up close and personal" do
you have to get? The mystique is gone.

Sad to say. the innocent victims of this
rotten mess are the starry-eyed. hero-
worshipping youth of America.

Autograph hunting has never been so
tough. Just ask little Billy Idolizer. On a re-
cent trip to an athletic convention in East
Jocksburg. Billy struck out not once. but
seven times. ‘ . ‘

Billy: Hey. Dad. Look! It’s John Riggins.
I Just gotta. get his autograph. . .Mr. Rig-
gins. would you please sign my book?

JR:.I. . .l. . .l'd lub to squirt. buh I Jus
can't. 'I gotta go to dis steak dinner at the
White House.

Billy: You mean "state" dinner?

JR: Steak (hiccup). . .state. wha'everl

Billy: But it'll Just take a second. please!

JR: Aw. quit whinin. kid! Ya gotta
loosen up. Hey. I'm really in a hurry. I got-
ta get to dis gin mill and knock down a

few more before I go. I heard the big guy's ‘

gonna be there.
Undaunted, Billy perseveres. Stumbling

over the Redskins runner. Billy chases

down Heisman winner Doug Flutie.
Billy: Excuse me. Mr. Flutie. could I

have your autograph?

DP: Sure. little boy!

Billy: Really. Mister. honest? Wow. a
real live NFL star. '

DP: Well. actually son. I play for the
New Jersey Generals in the USFL.

Billy: Ya mean that league where
everybody makes so much money. but no
one comes to watch. I . '

DB: That's right. young man. >

Billy: Forget, it!” Gimme my book
back. . .I wanna real football player.

DP: But...but...l make over $7.00 a
second.

Billy: So what? How many passes have
you completed?

DP: Uh...well. a couple in the fourth
quarter last week. but I'll get bet— hey.
where you goin'? Come back little boy. . .

Billy isn't distraught. though. Jim
Brown. the greatest running back in NFL
history. is right behind him.

Billy: Oh. Mr. Brown. could I bother
you for Just a second? .

JB: You‘re botherin' me already kid!
Can‘at you see I'm busy?

Billy: Hey. what are you doin’ to that
waitress? ' .

  

 

Islanders
vs.

 

Fl yers

hliedolphlo Phiillu' Stove Carlton: Blily

  
 
   

JB: None of your business wise ass!
Besides. she‘s enJoying it.

Billy: Then why is her mouth stuffed
with cocktail napkins? She looks
uncomfortable.

JB: No way. man. She's lovin' it. Why
shouldn't she? I'm the greatest player in
football history.

Two Jocksburg detectives whisk Brown
away. Billy is on the verge of tears.vbut he
doesn't give up.. Just one. that's all he
wants. . '

Billy: Aren't you Steve Carlton. the
Phillies pitcher? Would you give me an
autograph?

sc-

Billy: You sure look like him.
SC:

Billy: Cat got your tongue?
50

Billy: I’m terribly sorry. you must be the
wrong man.

Bewildered and confused. Billy nearly
passes out.

John McEnroe: Hey. watch where
you're going kid!

Billy: Omlgosh. you're John McEnroe!
Would you sign my book right on this

line. please? ' 

JMc: Why not. you deserve
mine. . .Here you go kid.

Billy: Gee. thanks very much. sir. Just
one thing. You signed it on the wrong
line.

JMc: What do you mean. on the wrong
lineii You gotta be out of your mind!
Where do they find incompetent kids like
you anyway! it's not even close to being
on the wrong line! Gimme it
back. . .rrrrriippp. . .

Now Billy's devestated. No book. much
less no autographs. slumped in a chair.
sobbing openly into his shrimp cocktail.
Billy feels a tap on his shoulder.

Edwin Moses} What seems to be the
problem. son?

Billy: I just can't get anyone's
autograph. I don't know what I'm doing
wrong. Can you help me?

BM: id be happy to Billy. You see. the
tridt is to get —

Just then. two drably clad men leap
from behind the champagne fountain.

Billy: Hey. where you guys takin' him?

Cop: Sorry. kid. we‘re taking him in.

Billy: But why?

Cop: You heard him kid. . ."The trick
is"...Prostitution. son. Hookers and all
that stuff. Terrible shame.

Billy: But he Just said trick!

Cop: We knew what he meant.

Soiled napkin in one hand. pen in the
other. Billy has one more chance..The
crowd is thinning out.

Billy: Mister. what's your name?

Man: Uhhh. . .Chris Waaasshhburm.

Billy: Didn't you used to play basketball
for North Carolina State? Can i have your
autograph?

CW: How do you spell that?

Billy: Spell what?

CW: waaasshhburrn.

wiy: W-A-S-H-B-U-R~N

CW: What's a "W"?

Billy: 23rd letter of the alphabet. last
time I looked.

CW: My soup only went up to 

Nearly two hours later. Washburn gives
Billy his napkin back. Billy scratches his
head. I

Billy: What's it say?

CW: Idon't know. I can't read.

Oh. where have you gone. Joe
DiMaggio.
