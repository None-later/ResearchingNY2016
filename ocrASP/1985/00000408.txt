The NFL draft

<5

27th vs. the pass. 5th vs. the rush. 25th
overall. One reason why they can't stop
anyone through the air is that they lack a
pure cornerback ~ they‘ve had a safety
playing either corner for the past ten
years. Last year. safety Dennis Smith had
to do it. if a cornerback is picked first. and
steps right in. Smith can go where he
belongs - back to safety. making the
secondary much better.

Miami Dolphins

The Dolphins will have a tough choice if
tailback Greg Allen of Florida State and
linebacker Jack Del Rio are on the board
when Miami chooses. The defensive line
had only 42 sacks but a rash of injuries
had a big hand in that. However. there's
no excuse for the run defense to be rank-
ed 22nd. Del Rio is cut from a Jack
Lambert-type of mold and would help.
but Shula can't pass on Allen. A
linebacker will be next.

San Francisco 49'ers
There are no drastic problems
anywhere. but a few positions need help.
At wide receiver. Freddie ‘ Solomon 
slowing down and Dwight Clark is slower

Generals’ Doug Flutleiwm anyone draft

than he was prior to his injury. Renaldo
Nehamiah hasn‘t proved he‘s dangerous.
so a speedy wide receiver should be first.
if Vance Johnson or Buster Rhymes is left.
either will be taken with Johnson being
first. on the list. The offensive line is
averaging 31 years old. so depth should
be added.

Seattle Seahawks_

Curt Warner's knee is said to be doing
fine. but insurance would be nice. Picking
late in the second round doesn't help. but
the need of a ﬂashy linebacker would be
possible. Throw the 24th-ranked rushing
statistic out the window - things will be
different with Warner back. ,A punter
should be picked late (NFL‘s worst in ‘84).

Washington Redskins
The 'Skins solved a major problem with
the acquisition of Rogers. but secondary
help is still a strong need. as they were
ranked 25th vs. the pass. They need a
quality safety and if Stanberry or Clark is
somehow left. they'll take him. Joe

Theismanu will turn 36 the day after the -

season opens and next year's number one
pick will be a quarterback. but don't be

.surprised if they take Doug Flutie in a _
. later round.» I. . D
