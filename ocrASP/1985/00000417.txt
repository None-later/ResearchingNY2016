seem to point to a resurgence of student
activism

According to Bruce Miroff. a SUNYA

‘ political science professor. protests over
issues such as dlvstiture in South Africa.
the appearance of Louis Farrakhan on

' campus. and the showing of Body Double
are “an initial sign of a resurgence of
political awareness."

President Reagan is one cause of this
new awareness. said Miroff. because his
policies are “the ntost extreme since the
l960’s. In the late sixties. students also
reacted to extreme government policies."
Activism is a force that has been “kindl-

definitely something going on" and cited
recent activities as a result of a “growing
restlessness and an awareness of Reagan's
policies as hypocritical and inconsistent

in recent years ‘led Kouns. there has
been a general feeling of apathy “in
response to the extremism of the sixties.
People saw confrontation :ts inc. cut
and they tended to move away front that.”

“We have now gone too far in that
direction." added Kouns. "We must learn
the limitations and mistakes of that move-
ment." he said.

Students are now “more organized and
communication links are better." said
Kouns. “The wide variety of tactics
available tro us make us more effective."
he added.
