Professor Steven Wasby of the Political
Science department will not be teaching at
SUNYA for the next two years due to a
punitive action by the University resulting
from a discrimination complaint filed
against him in late December.

The action was a result of a “grievance
for allegations of illegal discrimination"
which according to an Albany Times-
Union article was filed with the Affir-
mative Action Office on campus in late
December. ‘

Several political science students, who
asked not to be identified. said the women
who filed the complaint was a graduate
student and the complaint involved a
grievance for sexual harrassment.

Although the Director of Afﬁrmative
Action, Gloria DeSole refused to comment
on the speciﬁc case. she did say that her of-
fice handles complaints of discrimination
for race and ethnic origin. gender. disabili-
ty and age." She added that, “sexual har-
rassment is one of the allegations" that
would be handled through the department.

University ofﬁcials, however, refused to
comment on the nature of the grievance
claiming only that it was “illegal
discrimination.”

“Professor Wasby will not be on the
payroll next year." said Chair of the
Political Science Department Martin
Edelman. He explained that Wasby would
rpceive half of his pay the following year.
which he will be taking as a sabbatical.

“That is university policy," said
Edelman. “He is entitled to apply for a
year's sabbatical like any other
professor. ”

When Wasby was asked if the leave of
‘absence was due to any pressure from
students or the administration. he replied.
“The leave was approved by the

. University." I

Wasby alsosaid" that if any grievanc
hadjbeenlmade against him it "never
reached the formal stage."

When asked if Wasby's year away from
teaching without pay was a suspension,
Edclman said that was "not exactly ac-
curate." He did not however. explain why
the year was not a suspension and said
merely that "the conditions don't
technically fit President O’Leery’s descrip-
tion of suspension.” A

Edeiman emphasized that “this is not a
light result." adding that “the man is out
$50,000."

Wasby's annual salary. as quoted in the
Timcs~Union. is $50,392."

University ofﬁcials refused to comment on the nature of the greivancc against Wasby.

Although Edclman said there are no for-
mal conditions to Wasby's return in two
years. he did add that' “as a consequence,
there’s no longer a clean slate. if anything
else happened the roof could cave in."

One student claimed that one of the con-
ditionsof Wasby‘s leave was that he seek
psychiatric help. Edclman hesitantly
declined comment and suggested that
“you had better speak to Wasby about
that."

Wasby could not be reached to comment
on this statement. ‘

An agreementwas made that, according

--t0' Edelman, was satisfactory to the,

woman who filed the complaint. as well as
Wasby and the University.

Edelman stressed that the woman who
filed the complaint agreed to the subse-
quent conditions. saying, “no one forced
her to settie‘wi'th this." .

President Vincent O'Leary approved the
conditions of the agreement.

Edeiman explained that since the
grievance could be settled satisfactorily
through discussions between these people,
the process never reached more formal
stages of review.

DeSole said that there are plenty of good
reasons why someone would not take a
complaint all of the way through the for-

mat procedures. “it is time consuming and
dangerous." she said. adding that most
people would ask me to work on it “infor-
mally and much more subtly."

Edelman said he was very proud that the
University "took the allegations serious-
ly." adding. “it happened and wasn't
pushed under the rug, the University dealt
with it." :

A student who ftled a complaint against
Wasby last year said. “When i approached
Edelman about the problem last year. he
told me not to back out of it.”

in regard to Wasby's leavewithout pay.
she said. “i don't think that one year is
long enough. Obviously something is very
wrong if so many people are ﬁling
complaints."

Wasby said that he plans to do research
during the time that he is away. “i have a
lot of writing to do," he explained.

He added he will be working on a book

about civil rights litigation. involving.

schools. jobs. and housing. Wasby said.
According to information provided by
the University. Wasby previously taught at
Southern lllinois University from 1966 to
1978. He received his bachelor’s degree
from Antioch College and a master's and
'doetoratcdegree from the University of
Oregon. [3

announces

has doubled

By Bill Jacob
STAF} WRITER

Jenny Wilson. whose daughter.
Karen. has been missing for over one
month. announced Wednesday that the
reward being offered for her daughter's
return has been increased from the
original 35.000 to $10,000 the Albany
Times-Union reported Thursday.

During the press conference. Mrs.
Wilson once again appealed to the
public for any information which may
help police determine her daughter’s
location and asked for "anyone out
there who can help us to please come
forward."

Attempts by police in locating
Wilson. 22, have not produced any clues
as to her whereabouts. Wilson was last
seen at the Tanning Hut Salon on Cen-
tral Avenue, March 27.

Police said three witnesses reported
having seen a young woman ﬁtting
Wilson’s desription walking along
Fuller Road, but no clues have been
found in the area after police conducted
on extensive search.

Mark Foti, Wilson's boyfriend. join-
ed Mrs. Wilson at the press conference.
along with Assemblymember Samuel
Coleman (D-Spring Valley), who
employed Wilson as an intern, and
Henry Kirchner. Assistant Vice Presi-
dent for Student Affairs at SUNYA.

0f the $5,000 added to the original
reward. $1.000 is being pledged' by
University Auxiliary Services (UAS).
The rest of the reward comes from $50
donations by members of the state
assembly and senate and donations
given by friends of the Wilson family.
stationed at Plattsburgh Air Force Base,
where Wilson's father works, the Times-
Union reported.

Additional donations raised through
student fund-raising efforts. door-to-
door campaigns. and mail-in contribu-
tions will be used to nationally publicize
Wilson‘s disappearance through the
media and posters to be displayed
throughout the coutttry, Foti said.

Mrs. Wilson said that an effort will be
tnade to attract national coverage.
“We‘re trying to reach programs like 60
Minutes and 20/20 to see if they will
help us,“ site said.

The reward is being offered for “in-
formation leading to the arrest and con-
viction of the person or persons respon-
sible for Karen Wilson's disappearance,
and 'or the information that directly
leads to the finding of Karen,“ Mrs.
Wilson said.

Wilson is about 5'3” tall. She weighs
“5 bounds and has iigltt sandy browtt
hair and light hrowrt eyes. On the night
of her disappearance. she is believed to
