Sexual harassment tied to a

By Joyce Cohen

Sexual harrassment in the
workplace may seem a distant
problem for college student. but
many people enrolled at the
University are reporting incidents.
once they graduate and even in
summer jobs.

Debbie. a student at SUNYA,
recalled that upon applying for
her job during a telephone inter-
view, she was asked various ques-
tions regarding her physical ap-
pearance. “He asked me about
my qualifications and then
wanted to know if I was pretty."
The behavior continued through
the duration of her employment.
and in fact escalated to touching.
“He would put his arm around
me and say. iHoncy, do you
know how to make a pot of cof-

fee?‘ It made me feel like I was in- ‘

ferlor — low on the totem pole...l
didn’t complain because I didn't
want to cause trouble." ‘
Another SUNYA student. who
wished to remain anonymous.
recalls annoying harassment.
“From day one, I was constantly
being told how pretty I was. how
sexy I was. It was ﬂattering at

ﬁrst but it started to get really an- '

noying...it was also deﬁnitely in-
terfering with my Work. Finally.
the guy made one really rauncy
comment which setback to m
boss. She ﬁred himl" '

This is a relatively rare and
unusual end to sexual harass-

too many students to an apart-
ment." he said.

»_' ‘The University does not in-‘
terfére with a contract between
a student tenant and a
landlord." said Pogue. “For
students who choose to stay on
campus. we will house them.
Housing will’be at 103 per-
cent." he added.

“We were not consulted
about the Multari‘case." ex-
plained Pogue. adding that
“the city is under no obligation
to advise us of actions taken
against landlords. ’but only
those against students.

President O'Lcary was out
of town and could not be
reached for comment.

“We’re going to recommend
a very severe ﬁne of at least the
amount of the illegally received
rent". James D. Linnan,
special litigant assistant to the
Albany Corporation Counsel.
told the Times Union last week.
“In addition to the fine. we are
asking for jail time on each ac-
count.” he added.

“I think the grouper law is
unfair." said Multari. adding.
"not fair to landlords or
students. I don't care for me as
much. but for the kids who
were going to live in these

ment. Most victims ignore the
harasser for various reasons.
They don't want to be “trouble
makers:" they feel it's “normal
and to be cXpeeted" of men; and
many just don’t know the proper
avenues to take. At the extreme
end of the spectrum. many
women quit their jobs.

Inevitably. as women's employ-
ment opportunities increase. they
will encounter more instances of
sexual harassment. '

Tom. a student at SUNYA, en-
countered sexual harassment
from a male superior while in the
military. “I felt threatened by
both his physical presence and his
position of power. It started with
simple smart and overfricndly
comments. I didn't really feel
threatened at first. Then I began
to notice occasional physical
touching —- nothing too bad. just
tapping on my back or rubbing
my shoulders. I was always too
concerned with his inﬂuence and
position of power over me to do
anything about it...It ended when
he was transferred."

It is very apparent that sexual
harassment is alive and well in the
working world. today. Although
women are usually the subjects of
sexual harassment. men also ﬁnd

themselves in situations involving "

‘ both verbal and physical abuse.

“Because there are four
bedrooms in the apartment,
they knew. I am not blaming
the students; we knew about
it." she said.

“The lease has nothing to do
with the grouper law.” said
Mark Mishler. SA attorney.
“There is no law against four
persons on a lease. The law is
against four persons in an
apartment.” he added.‘

Mishler also said that
Jasmine See. a landlord who
was recently convicted on three
counts of violating the grouper
law and sentenced to 15 days in
jail and a maximum fine of
$250 for ech day each apart-
ments was rented illegally.

As a defense, Mishler said.
See claimed ignorance of ren-
ting to more than three people.
“The city has indicated that if
the landlord has not known
that there are four people. then
they are protected.” he said.

“Unwelcomcd sexual
vanccs. requests for sexual favors
and other verbal or physical con-
duct of a sexual nature constitute
sexual harassment when I) sub-
mission to such conduct is made

term or condition of an in-
dividual’s employment; 2) sub-

sions affecting such individual; or
3) such conduct has the purpose
or effect of unreasonably interfer-
ing with an individual's work per-
formance or creating an in-
timidating. hostile. or offensive
working environment."

According to a study by Loy
and Stewart there are four basic
types of sexual harassment. These
are verbal comments such as “Boy
do you look sexy today!.' verbal
negotiations like. ‘I can insure
your further advancement within
the company. Ms. Jones. if you
would be a little friendlier to me'
and manhandling, which includes
pinching and touching. as well as
physical assaults.

Forty-two percent of federal
employees have reported en-
countering sexual harassment.

four types being verbal com-
ments. followed by some form of
touching. Negotiation as well as
assault occur far less frequently.

they wouldn’t evict us. He ask-
ed who was not on the lease.
and after we told him. he left. I
didn't know the Multari's
would be arrested." Scheier
added.

“The Multari's are alright
landlords." explained Sheier.
“The house is in good condi-
tion and there are no problems
with the neighbors." He ex-
plained that there were three
deﬁnite bedrooms and no din-
ing room; he said that the front
room was converted into a
bedroom.

“We are not sure what we
are doing with rents." said
Mrs. Multari. “We currently
pay tenants' heat. but next year
the tenants will be paying
utilities." she said. adding "we
will not be in violation next
year."

"Neighbors dislike us
because we rent to students."
Mrs. Multari said. “We don’t
live there so they feel we don't
care. We do care. We have in-
.vestments involved." she
added. .

“instead of ﬁxing the pro-
blems with high rents. they are
causing higher rents." said

FRIDAY. MAYJ. I985 El ALBANY STUDENT PRESS 9

‘ Sexual harassment has clearly
been documented to show a cor-
relation to a power hierarchy. An
authority ﬁgure. or boss. by
deﬁnition has considerably more

. power than her/his subordinates.

making sexual harassment all .thc
more anxiety-provoking. Not
submitting to the “suggestions”
'of an employer might result in
losing a job. but. in the less fre-
quent cases of harassment among
people of equal status. it is usual-
ly males harassing female co-
workers.

Miro Bergman. a former
SUNYA student. now employed
as a supervisor at a prestigious
corporation. reported large
amounts of sexual harassment at
the corporate level. According to
Bergman. "When I see what's go-
ing on. I often ask the victim if
she would like me to speak to the
guy. or if she would rather take
care of it herself."

Unfortunately the reality of the
situation is that most victim's
don’t know where to turn or how
to cope with sexual harassment.

The effects of sexual harass-
ment may vary a great deal. Many
people report feelings ranging
from amusement and indifference
to a great deal of anxiety and
distress. One student remarked.
"It made me feel so humiliated
that someone could say those
things about me— it really hurt.”

pawer hierarchy

People usually report some degree
of fear — fear of losing their job.
fear of physical contact and
assault. For the most part, people
find sexual harassment is annoy-
ing and interferes with their work.

In cases where males are
harassed it is usually by females in
a superior position. However,
there are many differences in the
ways males and females interpret
sexual harassment.

According to a study by Gotck.
males interpret sexual gestures
from women more positively than
women do from men. They don't
report the distress and anxiety,
but since more men than women
are in positions of authority. men
probably don't encounter harass-
ment with the frequency or to the
extent that women do.

If you are the victim of sexual
harassment there are several
strategies you might consider.
First, tell the harasscr in no uncer-
tain terms that you are not in-
terested in the advances. If
harassment continues. make writ-
ten accounts of all incidents and
report to a superior. If the
harasser is your supervisor report '
to her supervisor. Sexual harass-
ment is illegal and civil law suits
can also be initiated.
