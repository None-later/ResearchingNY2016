children that they don’t have to train." any amy
even be willing to buy someone else’s children.
Condo explained that f‘one of the great ploys for
engaging children is to take pictures of them, either
naked pictures or pictures in” costume." ‘

in order to exploit the'child; the person may say,’ '

“do you want me to show these to your friends. or
do you want them to get out,", which will then force
the child to {engage in certain sexual activities
' against his or her will. according toCondo. V
“Child pornography in'many ways has to do with
- pedophiles and pedophile activities,” Condo add-
t ed. “There has been a real series of dressing kids up
if with makeup and doing their-hair," she said, which
suggests that it is okay for them to be sexual
objects. ' ' -‘
According to Condo, there are ﬁve types of
'pedophiles: j closetg’regressezd. ﬁxated. cottage and
gamma; ‘  ‘  

i- A closet pedophile collects pornography dealing
with children, and said Condo. these “porno collec-
tions are not just starting with violent pornography,
they might start with pictures of kids on the
beach." Pedophiles may use any of these types of
pictures to masturbate. she added. ‘ ~
_ Regressed and fixated pedophiles tend to have

Pedophiles are attracted to pre-pubcscent children

some sort of legitimate access to children. Regress-
ed pedophiles have limited access to children and at
Certain times they may even marry in order to gain
this type of access,‘ according to Condo, who added
that this ’person' will have control over his or her

. family.

Fixatcd'pe'dOphiles “gain access to large groups
of."children."‘- usually males. and will accomplish

‘ this by, getting into-“a profession which deals with

children. such as- a teacher. in order to have
legitimate authority over the children. she said.
Cottage pedophiles. according to Condo. “begin
keeping records of other pedophiles and then share
the material.” They create a type of network. she

V added.

The last type. commercial, are pedophiles who do
the buying. selling and exploiting of children, Con-
do said. -

According to Condo. “dealing with the problem
means instructing children what to look out for.
what is wrong and how to say no to anyone who
makes them feel uncomfortable."

“If we bury our heads in the sand and say that
this is an interrelated family problem. then we are
not facing the issue: it won't stop by itself." Condo
said. '

> About 140 students and faculty
members showed up Thursday
night at the seventh annual Stu-
dent Association Awards Dinner.
"it was a very good turn-out."
said Mike Miller. chair of the
Academic Affairs Committee. He
added that “the question the
whole time was if we would have
enough room."

The event. which was free.
honored faculty members in there
categories. Excellence in
Teaching. Excellence in Advise~
ment, and Administrator of the
Year.

John Sarkissian. a professor in
the Classics Department. Albert
Higgins, a professor in the
Department of Sociology, Donald
Him. a History professor. and
Robert Donnoliy. an instructor in
the Theatre Department were all
nominated for the award.

Higgins. who won the award.
said. “l've been teaching at this
school since l956. This is the first
time We ever been so honored.
As members of the Psychology
Department say. ‘your schedule
of reinforcement sucks'." he jok-
ed with Ihc audience ufter receiv-
ing a standing ovution

Nominated for Excellence in
Advisement were Kendall Blrr of
the History Department. Joseph

Zimmerman of the Political
Science Department and Joseph
Abdul Jarvis of EOP. Zimmer-

man received the award and told -

the audience that “it means much
more from students than from the
administration."

I‘You can get some of the most
far~reaehing advice in the
Rathskellar." said Miller. He

cited statistics found by the‘

Academic Affairs Committee in~
cluding. “Tthree quarters of all
students do not have extracur-
ricular contact with faculty. fore
graduating seniors the figure is St
percent," he said. .

The winner of the Ad-
ministrator of the Year Award
was Assistant Director of Student
Activities. Margaret Aldrich. “i
remember Guinness Day." recall-
ed Suzy Auletta. former SA Vice-
Prcsident. “when Peg was out
there with a garbage bag, picking
up Pepsi cups...lhul is the type of
administrator she is."

The cost of the event. accor-
ding to Miller was about $2.000.
“We doubled the size of thc peo—
ple attending. but the cost was
only slightly higher."hc said.
“We were funded by SA and got
donations from UAS tilltl the
class governments." he added.

“What's interesting about this
dinner." said Steve Russo. in
member of Ccntrul Council. “is

that last year‘s Academic Affairs
Committee was going to cancel it.
We showed that it was an impor-
tant event. and it went off really
well.“

“About 170 people signed up
for the event." said Miller. “with
about a three to one ration or
students to faculty."

“The cocktail hour went over
extremely well." Miller added.
"Dr. Pogue was great. asking
people their names and other
faculty members were doing the
same. It was a natural outgrowth
of the Student Faculty Dinner
help last March 19." he said.
Pogue is University Vice Presi-
dent of Student Affairs.

“The winners were selected
through student opinions. We im-
proved the questions from last
year," said Miller.

“Teaching awards are based
solely on teaching." Miller told
the audience. “Advisement
awards are based soley on advise-
ment and so on. ‘Univcrsity ser-
vice' and ‘publish or pcrish‘ are
words that have no meaning
here," he said.

“Next year I'd like to see the
event held in the llullroom instead
of the Patroon Room." said
Miller. who added that the event
wus a tremendous success and
that “with more people in atten-
dance. the importance of these
uwnrds would augment." “l
