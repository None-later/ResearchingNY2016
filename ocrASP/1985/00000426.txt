Farrakhan’s merits
To the Editor: ' I ' i

l was very disappointed by the ASP's in-
sensitive treatment of the Farrakhan issue

in its April 26 edition. With little excep- '

tion. the ASP sacriﬁced'journalistic in-
tegrity for the sake of controversy.

A newspaper should objectively bring
the story to the reader; not mold it and
shape it to fit "comfortably" into conver-
sation. indeed, Farrakhan is a man with a
great deal more to talk about than Chris-
tianity, Judaism and the state of lsrael.

l, as a part of SUNYA's black com-
munity. was outraged by the comparisons
made between Hitler. the Ku Klux Klan
and Farrakhan. V

Whether or not you agree with him. Far-
rakhan is a man whose hand you can
shake. Hitler gassed. burned and brutally
killed millions of Jews. The KKKLthe
south's “good ol’ boys," lynched. burned
and castrated thousands of black people.
Farrakhan is a man whyo speaks from a
pulpit and whose only weapon is a
microphone. How can a comparison be
made? .

Last Friday‘s edition suggested that Far-
rakhan take Martin Luther King, Jr.'s
pacifist approach. Hasn’t every successful
leader had his own way? For his people,
Farrakhan is a desperately needed strong,
black leader With merits of his own. For
black students on this campus such a sug-
gestion —- follow men who are “just like
MLK. Jr. — is a slap in the face. it is a
greatly resented attempt at choosing our
leaders for us. '

Martin Luther King. Jr. was a peace-
;vseeking. dedicated and nonviolent man.
He was gunned down in an act of racially-

motivated violence when he started getting:

"too close to his “dream.” it goes much

ivdeeper than‘ Lewish' students not; wanting ‘ -
' Farrakhan to speak here. .

‘ On the night of his speech Farrakhan
‘ was ﬂanked by security people. Whenever
fblack leaders have uniﬁed their peoplé to
'See “freedom at last." society has wished
to be “free of them." No exaggeration;
we've had Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey.

I

- Farrakhan has a deep understanding of
the oppression of his people and what it
takes ‘to break free. .Yes. many black

7 students went to hear him out -— they

know what he is about. Nevermind his
politics. Farrakhan belongs on this cam-
pusﬁ He had a message: “We shall
overcome.'.’ ~ 5

Double standard
To the Editor:
First. I must say that l neither agree

with, nor support, Minister Louis Far-
rakhan and i believe in Israel and its ex-

istence. Also, i am a caucasian.

Second. and the basis of this letter, i
would like to comment upon the attitude
and actions taken towards Mr. Farrakhan.

The statements quoted in the ASP‘from
one Mr. Mordechai Levy. leader of the
Jewish Defense Organization (JDO). that
"We do not protest him coming here to
SUNYA. we protest him as a human be-
ing." sounds very much like the attitudes
the Ku Klux Klan takes towards Blacks.
The rudeness and disrespect towards Mr.
Farrakhan’s right to speak was the exact
same action that members of RZA had
criticized the protestors against Rabbi

Kahane for doing. The only difference was ‘

that RZA was more violent in their loud
banging on the glass windows' and loud
chants of “Who do we want . . . Far-
rakhan.ihow do we want him . . . dead."
You can be sure that anyone wishing death
upon Kahane would have been branded an
anti-semetic racist. But not when RZA are
the protestors. they are doing it under the
guise of stopping racism. (Double Stan-
dard7?) But is not what they are doing
itself racist and exactly what the Ku Klux
Klan does behind the mask of white
supremacy? Yestt , ,1 .._ . '

The evidence to support this again
comes from Mr. Levy, when he says,
“Those who brought Farrakhan here will
be treated as enemies of the Jewish people
and will (be) punished necordinglyf" Con-
tinuing, Levy said. “Wehave the names,

1 phone numbers.,and addresses ofthose in-

FRIDA v, MA Y 3, I985 D ALBANY STUDENT PRESSP1‘9

volved and they will be punished." Are
they going to burn a Star of David on the
front lawns of those people much as the,
KKK burns a cross on the lawn of those
against white supremacy? Sure does sound
like it. _

Surely from Mr. Levy’s above mention-
ed statements it is apparent his comment,
“Louis Farrakhan is a klansman with
blackskin, there is no difference between
his ideas and that of the Klan," is what he
professes and probably practices. There is
no difference between the racism Mr. Levy
(and the RZA since they stated they sup-
port Levy) seeks to destroy and that which
he practices. Both are violent. extremist.
and show no respect for human life.

I support the.protest by -RZA, since that
is their right. but RZA should not use a
double standard in what they profess and
how they actll .

Misguided views .

To the Editor:

' In regard to the ASP article on Friday.
April 26-entitled, “Over 400 Gather in Fer-
vent Protest of Muslim Minister." 1 think
that the views of most of the protestors. as
well as the protest in general. was
misrepresented. ' '

Much too much of the aforementioned
article was spent in representing the' views.
.of one person from a radical Jewish
organization (JDO). I think it Would have
been a little bit more justifiedif in fact the'
J 00' had any part in organizing the protest
or even'if the'organization was invited to

’ attend. Theauthor of the article would
have been less biased if he had interviewed

‘ other members of the protest or at least
other unaffiliated vocal participants.“

The'protest on the whole: as'a peaceful

, Ans-stems or. “Death :. .0 transitions.

were" looked upon 'wi h- ‘sco‘rn and
dissipated quickly. Bangihg'upon the win-
dows of the LC's was effectively
prevented. Pacifism was the extent of the
protest, for not many wanted to violate the
“two wrongs don't'fnake a right" dictum
and advocate violence in thepresence of a

violence advocate (Farrakhan).
lam not accusing the author of lying but
i do in fact strongly suggest that there is
certainly much harm done when news is
presented in part and not in whole. Sins of
ommission are a plague and must be
eliminated along with lies, especially in the
scope of the media. Be careful so this
misrepresentation shall too. never happen
again! I -
Howard Mueller

Biased coverage

To the Editor:

The ASP's tremendously biased coverage
of the Farrakhan speech and protest needs
to be corrected. The informed reader 'of
Friday’s edition who was not at. either pro-
test (yes. there were two) and who is

. somehow unaware of Farrakhan's normal-

ly vitriolic rhetoric would form the impres—
sion that 400 bloodthirsty Jews were out to
prey on an angelic. benevolent black man
and his well meaning followers. Wrong.
Farrakhan. the most controversial figure
in the 1984 presidential election (and he
wasn't even running). whose remarks his
associate Jesse Jackson himself disavow-
ed, is in fact a man teeming with hatred for
members of all religions other than his
own, afﬁrmed by anti-semitic and anti-
christian comments. That he suddenly
denies the most scathing accusations
(“Judaism is a gutter religion' ') makes him
a two-faced liar too. That he “disagrees
with the State of lsrael" (an almost neutral
remark compared to his calling lsrael a
“criminal state") is a thinly veiled attempt
at disguising his anti-semitism as anti-
lsrael. . -‘

The protest rally the ASP described
resembles a lynch mob. This was hardly
the case. The JSC rally was calm, centered
around Jewish and Christian and black
and white speakers condemning. Far-
rakhan. The RZA rally was more emo-
tional. however violence was never sug-

. gested or desired. One person from outside

the, campus community ,gwas there who
made some maligning' remarks; he was
silenced by the people there and the leaders
of the rally.

The most unfortunate result of the event
was that Jew and black were pitted against
each other.
