Fifteen years ago the NY. State Section
l Cross Country meet was held at Albany
State. Big deal. right? Well, it is a big deal
because competing in that race was a high
school senior from Yorktown Heights,
Vinny Reda. Two weeks ago Vinny Rcda
returned to Albany State as the new sports
information director.

Reda finished 15th in the scctionals, but
more importantly that's when he decided
to come to this University.

“Coach Munsey congratulated meat the
end ofthe race." reflected Reda. “I said ‘I
want to come ltere. He recruited the star-
ting at that moment."

The bearded 33-year old SID continued
to reﬂect. “There were less trccs here then.
Those trees outside were five feet high."
said Reda as his brown eyes searched out
of the Rat window.

“You could see across campus to the
Adirondacks and on the other side the Cat-
‘skills.” continued Reda. “There was a
sense of we just plopped these buildings in-
to this barren plain. To me there was a
.sense of new growth. There was something
exciting about going to a place that made
its imprint in concrete."

The next fall Reda began his
undergraduate studies at the University.
Four years later he graduated as an English
major with film as a minor. in that same
year. 1974. Reda was named an All-
American in cross country.

“I considered Albany my home since I
first came to school here in l970," said
Reda. “I considered myself an Albanian. l
love the city. I love the area."

Aside from being a former student.
Reda brings an interesting mix of creden-
tials to the job. He's a free lance journalist
and a singer, having also done some
editing. copy reading and researching in
the past.

After graduating he worked at the Times
Record in Troy for six years as a beat
reporter and columnist. resigning in l98l.
Since then. he's been a free lancc'journalist
at the Albany Eagle. where ltc had a sports
column and now at the Times Union,
where he covers arts and entertainment
plus writing a column every week on runn-
ing for the sports section.

Reda worked with Bill Kennedy. an old
professor and close friend. on Oh Albany.
Since l977-78. he‘s done local theatre.
Lately. he sings at the Halfmoon cafe.

“The easiest way to describe the music l
sing is “it's a lot of Frank Sinatra," said
Rcda as he put down his Kronenbourg
beer. “He's an idol ofmy mature life. I do
a lot of songs he doesn't do. Some great
American songs of the 205 and 305 plus
new ones in the jazz world that I find
bright and original."

When Reda was in seventh grade he por-
trayed John the Baptist in a play. He
equates his present job as SID to assuming
the role of John the Baptist. This time not
spreading the news of Christ, but of
Albany State athletics.

“In terms of being the SID,.I enjoy tell-
ing people about these bright young people
doing tnarvclous things in both athletic
and educational ways." said Albany
State's John the Baptist.

Reda's job will be to alert the local news
media to the sporting events and happen-
ings of the University. Two other func-
tions will be press boxes and sports
brochures.

He plans to devote a lot of time to the
hometown angle. as he calls it. “A real
priority for me is to make sure that the
concept of SUNYA athletics and the
University as a whole is brought to the at-
tention of the entire state." said the new
SID. “For people who are doing well l
want people in their hometown to know
they are doing well in every way possible."

 

Reda appears to have jumped into his
job with plenty of enthusiasm for the
Universtiy. the athletes and the coaches.

“The coaches here are people of
character. The kind of people who put
winning and losing in perspective." said
the former collegiate athlete. “That’s
something l 'was always aware of. They're
people I admire."

One interesting change he'll have to deal
with is the emergence of women‘s sports
since his college days.

“It's really amazing. l would have
thought I had a certain bias against
women's sports in the sense that of it will
be a lower level." said Reda. “Whe i was
here. two girls throwing a ball around were'
freaks. Frisbee was fun and ok. but a ball
is sports. Women's sports are competitive-
ly as exciting as any one else and the level is
gonna go up even more."

“We as a department are very pleased to
have him," said Athletic director Bill
Moore; “He was an athlete here. is a well
regarded columnist, he's done private

Craig Parlato have turned in some quick
middle distance times, and Paul Manee
(jumps). Bruce Van Tassel (hurdles), Mike
Riggins (sprints) and John Reilly (sprints)

have been consistent scorers. Bob-

Munsey's Danes completed the dual meet
season with a 6-2 record. including a win
over their local rivals. RPI.

The indoor track season was highlighted
by Marc Mercurio's fifth place ﬁnish in
the weight throw at the NCAAs. The
senior also broke his own school record in
the event. by throwing 54’3". Teamwise
the year was a disapointment. The
tracksters placed third in the SUNYACs.
eighth at the state meet and ﬁnished with a
3-5 dual meet record. Ed McGill placed se-

 

cditoriai work. He has a varied
background and a good pulse of our
needs. We’re very pleased he fits in
nicely."

Reda, a former athlete at the school. is
familiar with many of the coaches. From
his college days he knows coache Ford.
Lewis. Sauers, Garcia. White, Munsey and
Palmer. The new ones he had to meet were
mostly women’s sports coaches.

“He was one of the greatest cross coun-
try athletes we’ve had‘here.” said football
coach Bob Ford. “We're fortunate to get
him with us. We were looking for someone
with ﬂexibility of hours and we need so-
meone to devote a lot of time to it. It
always helps to bleed purple and he bleeds
purple."

‘Reda feels it's a perfect job for him.
“it’s a great job to have while expanding
my journalism career. I can do those while
I have this job. It's a nice base for me here.
If there's been anything constant and
secure in my life, it has always been this
University." El

Freshman Curt Wiedman. :1 13'6" pole

The 1984 season was also an outstanding
one for the women’s cross country team.
For the first time in the history of Albany
State, the team qualified for the NCAAs
Division Iii tournament. held at Ohio
Weslyan University. An eighth-place finish
was quite respected for the i4-0‘team.

Highlights of the season included second
place finishes at the Easterns and the
NCAA qualiﬁers held at Hamilton Col-
lege. Junior Karen Kurthy and sophomore
Kim Pettichord also qualiﬁed individually
for the Nationals.

on Andy Seras." asked the 22
year old senior while bouncing a
lacrosse ball? “He sounded like
Mr. T." '

Not to worry. Al. For one
thing, at 5‘li" and 170 lbs.. with
deep blue eyes and not a strand of
gold around his neck, the Albany
goalie hardly fits the Mr. T mold.
And given head lacrosse coach
Rick Flanders’ description of
him. Superman isn’t the first per-
son which comes to mind either.
Clark Kent. maybe.

“Here‘s ‘Corny’ in a nutshell."

said Flanders. “He’s intense. and
rather unathletic at times. i saw
him play volleyball one time and I
though to myself. ‘You’ve got to
be kidding’."
t But Flanders goes on to add
another facet of Al's character. A
very important one. “He's a great
goalie.”

“Out of the four years Al's
been with the program he's been
the team's only goalie for three of
them." said Flanders. “And
that's been on a team where the
coaching weakness has been'with
the goalie position. l'd liken his
experience to that of '-a-student
cooped up in his room by himself
for four years and taking in-
dependent study courses."

Goalie COrnfi‘eld finishes up illustrious career

 

Great Dane goalie Al Cornfield scoops up the lacrosse ball.

one needs to excel at the position.

“His ability to run isn't the
greatest which doesn‘t allow him
to be too mobile around the
cage." says Flanders. “lfl was to
say to the team ‘O-K guys. imita-
tion time.’ every one of them
would do an impersonation of
Corny trying to get the ball out of
the goal." '

“But,” finishes assistant coach
Chuck Priore. “He gets the ball
out." »

“He’s got great reflexes." sayd
Flanders. “He works so hard at
the 'game, how to position

:himself. Goalie is such a specific
position and Al has been able to

use his plusses to more than cotn-
pensate for his minuses."
Lacrosse first became a part of

Al‘s life while an eighth grader at-
tending Boardman Junior High in
Oceanside along with present
teammates Brad Rabinowitz and
Al Hockheiser.

“I played goal from the beginn-
ing." s'ays Al,"Inain|y because
the team needed a goalie. i like
the position because it gives me
the chance to have a serious say in
the outcome of the game."

Before he can have that say.
however. come the rituals. About
seven of them. according to
Flanders.

.“Goalies.” says Flanders. with
strong conviction. “are not right
people. Al says he has to have five
minutes to himself before the
game. which is just fine with me
because he’s so hyper i want to

strangle him. Then he says he
wants someone to take four or
five shots on him rigltt before the
game but he also wants to do the
coin toss at the same time. We
still haven‘t been able to work
that one out."

Nor has the team been able to
work out its problems this season,
undefinable problems that ac-
count for the team's disappoin-
ting 3-9 record with one game
remaining.

"We're a team made up ofa lot
of returning seniors. all of whom
expected to have a good season.
the best since we've been here."
says’Al. “For some reason. our
individual talents never came
together.”

greater talents on the team is pro-
ven by his leadership in star-of-
the-game points.

- “Personally i'm having a pret-
ty good season." says Al. “But
I'd rather have a terrible season
personally, and be winning more
games. But it really boils down to
this; I wouldn’t want to play for
any other team in the country.
This is a team of good friends and
good workers win or lose I’d
rather be with them.”

Sorry to bring Superman into
this Al, but like the man of steel.
Cornfield's personality undergoes
changes. It changes dramatically
from one of intensity on the ﬁeld
to what Flanders describes as “an
honest. sincere. caring person
with a great work ethic." off of
it.

“I’d say that I do what I like to
do within the limits of practicali-
ty." says Cornﬁeld. For instance.
when I came to college my parents
didn't want me to play lacrosse.
they thought I should spend more
time on my studies. But I’ve
shown that I can play lacrosse and
have time to study."

it's been time well spent. as Al.
a'psychology major, has been ac-
cepted to several medical schools.

“I've wanted to be a doctor
since i was pretty young. around
ninth grade. I guess." says Cor-
nfield. “l thought it was amazing
that you .could cure people and
make things better and make a
living at it."

Many may regard his ability to
devote a considerable amount of
time to lacrosse. while
simultaneously reaching the high
academic standards necessary for
medical school acceptance, as
quite an accomplishment. Al
shrugs it off as being not unusual.

“A lot of people do what i
do." says Al. “On our team

Despite the recent losing streak of the Albany.
State men's tennis team. which has lost their last
four matches, they are enthusiastic about their up-
coming mateh against Hartwick today.

The Danes lost a tough match against Williams
Tuesday. 5-4. They were victorious in four of six
singles matches, but in losing all three doubles they
handed the match over to Williams.

Dave Grossman defeated Craig Hammond at
first singles. 6-4, 6-2. Mike Dcrmansky beat
Williams fourth singles player Clarey. 7-5, 6-4. At
fifth singles David Zobler defeated Peterson. 6-4.
6-7. 6-3. Mark Sanders was victorious at sixth
singles winning. 6-l. 6-4.

Jay Eisenberg and Tom Schmitz suffered losses
in second and third singles, respectively. Eisenbcrg
was overwhelmed by Tim Rivers of Williams losing,
6-l. 6-2. Schmitz also suffered a big loss against
Craig Callahan. 6-2, 6-0.

All three doubles teams. which consist of
Grossman and Schmitz, Eisenberg and Dermansky.
aItd Sanders and Zobler were defeated. The
deéiding match was the third doubles team of
Sanders and Zobler. They were nipped in the first
set, 7-6. but came back strong in the second set win-
ning. 6-3. Due to darkness the third set had to be
moved indoors. There was about a half an hour
delay in which Sanders and Zobler cooled off and
lost. 6-2.

“‘We were psyched after winning. but the delay
broke our rhythm." said Sanders.

The Danes played great despite the tough loss.
"Williams is a good team. They beat Amherst and
Amherst beat as easily." said Coach Bob Lewis,
“Our guys did a'flne job against them." .

The Danes-were crushed by'Colgate losing. 5-}

without even playing doubles. "We were blown off
the courts," said Sanders. “Part of the reason Ive
lost by such a big margin is van lag. After getting
honte late Tuesday night we got up the next morn-
ing to travel two more hours in the van to Colgate."

The only victory for Albany was first singles
player Dave Grosstnan. He defeated Allen Flowers,
6-l. 3-6. 6-4.

Eisenbcrg played a fine match against Dave Con-
isar of Colgate. despite losing. 6-1. 4-6. 7-5. At
sixth singles Sanders was defeated. 6-2. 6-3.
Schmitz. Dertnansky, and Zobler all lost com-
petitive matches at third. fourth. and fifthsinglcs.

It was a trying week for the Danes. playing two
tough schools in a row. however. their spirits are up
to make a come back against Hartwick Friday.
Albany beat Hartwick in the fall. but it will be a
tough match as they will be without their number
one singles player Grossman and their fifth singles
player Mitch Gerber.

"We've been on a losing streak, but hopefully
we'll come back against Hartwick Friday." said
Zobler. "We are psyched to win — we need a good
win to close out the season."

Despite tough breaks the team has accomplished
its' goals. They won the RPI tournament.
SUNYAC's for the sixth year in a row. and they
placed third in the ECAC tournament out of 30
teams. 

“I am disappointed though. that the team didn't
play up to its capabilities this spring."'said Coach
Lewis. “Perhaps it '5 due to academic pressure. lack
of innovation. or just tough competition. but We
