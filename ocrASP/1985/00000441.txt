COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE A new
recreational drug seems to be ap-
pearing on - college campuses.
researchers say. 7

_Use of "magic" mushrooms —
natural hallucinogenics with» ef-
fects similar to‘ but milder than
LS_D — is rising on the West
coast. in New York City and even
on British campuses. say resear-
chers at UCLA and Cal State-
Nbrthridge.

lBut national drug surveys are
missing what could be the beginn-
ing of a trend by asking the wrong
questions and mmisinterpreting
data. the researchers add. ‘

The study. prepared by UCLA

student John Thompson. Cal
State ethnobotanist William Em-
boden and UCLA psychologists
M. Douglas Anglin and Dennis
Fisher, said nearly 15 percent of
1.507 students surveyed at UCLA
and Cal State-Northridge admit-
ted to using mushrooms at least
once. ' .
A state Substance Abuse Ser-
vices study showed New York Ci-
ty high school students who had
tried hallucinogenics. including
mushrooms. increased from six
percent in 1978 to lo percent in
I983. .

“Our survey proved Vtwo
things." Fisher said. “First.
mushrooms are the major
hallucinogenic being used in our
sample. not LSD. And second.
national drug surveys are asking
questions in the wrong way and
misreporting the data."he added.

When mushroom users are ask-
ed',if they have used LSD or
anything similar. “yes”.
respondents are labeled LSD
users in other surveys. Fisher

said. Those who don't consider
mushrooms similar to LSD
answer “no” and are recorded as
non-users. “Either way. the
answers are misreported.",Fisher
said.

3 Most studies. Fisher claimed.
show hallucinogenics use is
stable, but don't show use varia-
tions for different kinds of
hallucinogens. The California
study. which asked specific ques-
tions about mushrooms, LSD and
other hallucinogenics, shows
most users have tried mushrooms.
but few have taken just LSD. he
claimed.

it’s not the ﬁrst inkling that
hallucinogens are coming back.

In 1983. Drug Enforcement
Administration spokesman Franz
Hirzy said falling prices were in-
creasing LSD’s popularity.

A recent Arizona State study
found LSD use had risen at four
of five campuses surveyed: North
Carolina. Arizona State. SUNY
and Penn. But the National In-
stitute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) is
skeptical.

“i haven’t heard about increas-
ed mushroom use at least on this
side of the country.“ said NIDA
Washington. DC. gspokeswoman
Dorin Czechowitz. “And i can't
say (the California) study is sup-
ported by any data in our
surveys," she added. '

But. so far. mushroom use
seems to be confined to small.
areas on both coasts. Anglin said.

.“The mushroom center seems
to be established in Washington
state.“ Fisher agreed. “The

Pacific Northwest has an ideal
wet. humid climate for growth.

there." _

The-new interest in mushrooms
could be cyclical. researcher
Anglin explained. “Don't ask me
why. but about every 20 years is a
cycle for drugs.“ he said. “it’s
like We had nostalgia for the 'SOs
'and now the ’60’s. People who
,didn't live through those times
find them interesting."

Anglin blames “media
hype"for generating interest in
