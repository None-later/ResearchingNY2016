According to Pelton. SA’s situation has
been “reevaluated by CONTEL represen-
tatives" and their problems are being dealt

with. Pelton added ’that the switch over'

from New York Telephones Centrcx i
system to the new CONTEL SLl¢XM
system Was the “smoothest cutover ever
seen.” Problems like informing people of
the new telephone numbers will go away
after the system has been functioning for a
while. he said. .
.According to Leo Neveu. SUNYA's
Controller, the university would save
If money because of the immediate efﬁcien-
cies of the new system and because of
“cost avoidances.“ like calls between the
campuses.

The original estimate of savings would
have to be “modified to" some extent."
said Neveu. because several enhancements
have been hade in‘the system allowing for
communication through University com-
putcr terminals, which were not included
in the original estimate. No new savings
analysis has been conducted as of yet, he
said., _ _

events. Most notably. WQBK‘s good-old
Party in the Park has found a permanent

September, local bands will rock the Plaza

Beneath this concrete extravaganza is a
showcase of modern art waiting to be
discovered. In the underground mega-
corridor that spans the length of the Plaza.
the walls are lined with a bizarre assort-
ment of abstract expressionist and other
exciting pieces of modern art. Attd late at

Ray Kinley. Democratic Commissioner
of the Board of Elections. defended the
decision to switch the polling place to the
nursing home. “l think under the set of
circumstances it had to be done this way."
said Kinley. "The people in the nursing
home must have preference. How are they
going to vote?"

“We don‘t want to disenfranchise the
elderly" said Gawley. “‘l just think it‘s
detrimental to put students and the elderly
in the same district."

"We realize that there should be a
special voting place for the elderly." said

The new telephone system also saves the V

,University money on long distance calls,
said Neveti. The, old system gave the
Uhlversityaccess to WATTS lines. which
provided discount rates for; long distance
calls within New. York State. Now the
University has access to WATTS'lines ser-

Neveu.

According to Neveu. the dormitories
were not included in the CONTEL system
because service for dormitory phones
would be .“signivicantly higher than what
students are now paying" New York
Telephone. University officials informed
quad board members about the rate dif-
ferences and made _the decision not to

' change the quad telephones in conjunction

with the quad boards,- said Neveu. I

There is the flexibility to “include the
dorms at a later date" if New York
Telephone’s rates increase enough to made
the CONTEL system economical. said
