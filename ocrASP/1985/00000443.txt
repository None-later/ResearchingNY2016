According to Pelton. SA’s situation has
been “reevaluated by CONTEL represen-
tatives" and their problems are being dealt

with. Pelton added that the switch over i‘

from New York Telephones Centrex~l
system to the new CONTEL SLl.—XM
system was the “smoothest cutover ever
seen." Problems like informing people of
the new telephone numbers will go away

after the system has been functioning for a V

while. he said. .
.Aecording to Leo Neveu. SUNYA’s
Controller. the university would save
I? money because of the immediate efﬁcien-
cies of the new system and because of
“cost avoidances." like calls between the
campuses.

The original estimate of savings would
have to be "modified to‘ some extent,"
said Neveu. because several enhancements
have been hade in the system allowing for
communication through University com-
puter terminals, which were not included
in the original estimate. Nonew savings
analysis has been conducted as of yet. he

alive with a variety of concerts and other
events. Most notably. WQBK's good-old
Party in the Park has found a permanent
home there. Every Thursday. into
September. local bands will rock the Plaza
for the benefit of-Easter Seals.

Beneath this concrete extravaganza is a
showcase of modern art waiting to be
discovered. in the underground mega-
corridor that spans the length of the Plaza.
the walls are lined with a bizarre assort~
tnent of abstract expressionist and other
exciting pieces of modern art. And late at
night. if the hallway is still open. you have
this quasi-museum all to yourself. If not
inspirational. at least it's an exciting and
eerie experience; Afterwards. you can

aIWuys sit on the ledge overlooking the

river and a sizable Verical drop down to the
highway.which the Plaza also affords.
Across the street from this experience is
the New York State Museum. It‘s a nifty
museum. Besides art (this spring it showed

Ray Kinley. Democratic Commissioner
of the Board of Elections. defended the
decision to switch the polling place to the
nursing home. “i think under the set of
circumstances it had to be done this way."
said Kinley. “The people in the nursing
home must have preference. How are they
going to vote?"

“We don‘t want to disenfranchise the
elderly" said Gawley. f‘l just think it‘s
detrimental to put students and the elderly
in the same district."

“We realize that there should be a
special voting place for the elderly." said
Ross Abelow. SA vice president. “but you

The new telephone system also saves the

,University money on long distance calls.
said Neveu’. The old system gave the
University access to WATTS lines. which
provided discount rates for long distance
calls within‘New York State. Now the
University has access to WATTS lines ser-

vicing the continental United States. said ‘

Neveu.

According to Neveu, the dormitories
were not included in the CONTEL system
because service for dormitory phones
would be .“signivicantly higher than what
students are now paying” New York
Telephone. University officials informed
quad board members about the rate dif-
ferences and made _the decision not to
change the quad telephones in conjunction
with the quad boards. said Neveu. p '

There is the flexibility to “include the
dorms at a later date" if New York
Telephone's rates increase enough to made
the CONTEL system economical. said
Neveu.

The installment of “tie lines" linking
the new system’and the dormitories in
order to get unlimited calls would cost
about $200 a month. said Neveu.

The last of our walking wonders is
Washington Park. You might spend more
time here this summer than attywhwerc
else. Briliantly designed and beautifully
landscaped. the park seems like a summer
paradise in a few square blocks. Besides
the basketball. tennis and handball courts.
sunny fields. playground and shady knolls.
that park features paddle-boat rides and
fishing in the lazy picturesque lake and old
fashioned boathouse. it‘s a good place to
run. if you‘re into that kind of torture.

lesser known attractions worth walking to.
