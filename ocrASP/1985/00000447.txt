Wilson's family, who live in Platt-

banded together to contribute to the
Find Karen Wilson Fund. According to
former SA Media Director Libby Post,

University Auxiliary Services (UAS)
donated $1,000. and Student Associa-

State Legislator Samuel Coleman, for
whom Wilson was interning at the time
of her disappearance. and various other
legislators donated $2,000 and the class
of '85 contributed approximately $2,000
for a walkie talkie system for the Don’t

SA President. Steve Gawley said.
“We will be platering the campus with
1.000 new Karen Wilson posters in the
hope _of heightening public awareness,
not only about Karen Wilson but about
womens safety issues in general."

Jim Williams, Director of Public
