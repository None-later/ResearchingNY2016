Ohio State’s students demand South 'Afric

it to OSU in May, when nearly 400
students and workers disruptd a trustees’
meeting by banging on a room divider,
chanting and pursuing trustees as they hur-
ried from the scene under police
protection. '
Police arrested one union member.
Jennings and the trustees changed their
minds soon thereafter.

A week later, the trustees signed a new
union contract. At its next meeting, on
June 7, the board agreed to divestiture by a
6-3 vote.

Nicholas thinks the trustees simply read
handwriting ‘on the ,wall. “i think they
ﬁgured that in a few years they’ll be forced

to divest (by a state law) anyway, and that I

time might not be as economically
beneﬁcial (as selling now),” Nicholas

speculated.

“Without the union, i don't think it
would have happene ,” said Stephanie
Gussler, a sophomore communications
major. “(lt) had the ﬁnancial resources.
the numbers, the negotiationg and legal ex-
pertise. It was essential.”

No trustees are willing to say the,union
pressure changed their mind, though a few
concede student pressure played a role.
“Basically, we (the trustees) were surprised
by the student protests." asserted Trustee
Joe Teasford. “Campuses are remarkably
placid these days,” he explained.“ “To me,
it was most refreshing that students were '
interested in something." .

in introducing the proposal‘to sell the
stocks, Jennings called apartheid “moral-
ly, socially, and economically bankrupt,"
and said OSU should not associate with it,

regardless of the profit loss on,the in-
vestments sold. ‘ ' ' '

that divestment over time would cause no
economic loss. In factI recent studies show

that universities that divest over time have '

made a profit."

“I'm a lawyerpand my first question
was fiduciary duty to-OSU,” 'Teasford
noted; “But‘l did a lot of reading and the
basic question,- of 1cou'rse,is the South
African government is evil."

Under the concept of fiduciary respon-
sibility, the managers of a public fund'ar'e

legally obligated to'manage the fund’- as ~

profitably aspossible. if a manager refuses
or fails to manage the'fund profitablyilie

or she can be ﬁred or penalized by a judge: -

Redman said divestiture would cost
OSU money and weaken the South

new, said Martone. "We have a strong commitment to
house as many people as possible so we assign over 100

According to ‘Martone the‘ alternativesvtoiover?

crowding are worse. -“The options of not providing ,7

freshmena guarantee for housing or putting a continu-

ing student on a waiting list are not acceptable," he
said: I , , ‘ .

Manone explained thatthis problem has been going

' on for 14 years and will probably happen againnext

year. “I personally think it is essential to guarantee r
freshman housing. Ifhey are in need to adjust to so
many things and this ivouid place an‘unnatural burden
on them." . ‘ .
However, said Martone. the new apartments that
will go up on Fuller Road, within 2 years‘ will help ease
the situation. “The extraAOO beds will really. help us
on ,"(he said. ~ ' 5 i V,   _

 Donise Cromwe’llr‘a' first year student on Indian ‘

Quad, said living in a triple is “okay in a way. but can
be hard at times." Sharing everything all the time can
be a problem, she explained. . '
ﬂower/er. Kirk Huttie'ston, a junior transfer student
living on Colonial Quad in a quadrupled room said it is
not as bad as he expected. "I received a letter saying
not to bring much stuff with me so i ﬁgured maybe I
would have room for an extra pair of socks," he said.
Huttleston explained he was going home this weekend
to get more ofhisthlngs- .
‘ According to Martone, there is no research which
shows that increased occupancy hurts a students’

. academics in any way. However, frosh Lynda Yacenda
'said. “It is tough to study because there is so much

noise all the time. " She explained that people are com-
ing in and out at all times and added that her suite had
only three desks for four people. '

One problem brought up by frosh Denise Cromwell

7 is getting out of a tripled rom. Cromwell explained that

the first person in the room who applied for housing
goes 'on a list with everyone else in the university who is
tripled. When your name comes up you have to pick

who moves but of the room, she said. :

“The problem arises if no one wants to move out,"
Cromwell said. She explained that if this happens, your
name is put back _on the waiting list and if it comes up
again the last person who applied for housing in the
room is asked to move out.

“You have the option of remaining tripled then but
you must pay for normal- occupancy," she said.
Cromwell added that she felt this policy was unfair.

Kristen Connolly, a new student on Dutch Quad
agreed, saying, “It's not so bad. Once you get used to
it, nobody wants to move." Connolly added that
“none of us have ever lived in a dorm before so we’re
like, 'that's how things are.’ "

According to Martone the real work is placed on the

'residential staff. “The more people there are the more

interpersonal problems there are." He explained that
meetings were held with students to explain exactly
what was going on.

Although increased occupancy provides many incon—
viences, according to Martone, in the long run the
university beneﬁts. “It is‘in our long term beneﬁt from
an economic standpoint to keep the buildings ﬁlled.” ‘
he said. Cl

Ros : "h Ha shanah Greetings

We are living in the Jewish month of Elul, when Gad opens gates for the whole
world to come closer to each other and to G-d. Pa
Hashanah,]we. sound the shofar (ram’s horn). remin ing each of us how far we have
ing out to usftoiawakelfrom our spiritual sleep, begging us to return to
at is I 0131 in the World. G-d looks at each of us more closely now. asking us to
search, ,to discover. to resolve, to heal the wounds of our own particular being,
while working together towards the betterment of all Creation.

May the blasts of the shofar heralding in the year 5 746 penetrate our innermost
being, and inspire 'us to renew our faith in G-d

as we prepare for Rosh

and the G-dliness inherent in each
