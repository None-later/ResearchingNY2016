' Rgsh Hg shanah Greetingg

We are living in the Jewish month of Elul. when G-d opens gates for the whole
world to come closer to each other and to G-d. Pa as we prepare for Rosh
Hashanahfwe‘ sound the shofar (ram’s horn), remin ing each of us how far we have
slip ed, ' ‘iriggout to us to awakesfrom our spiritual sleep, begging us to return to
all at is oly: in the World. _G-d looks at each of us more closely now. asking us to
search, .to discover; toresolve. to heal the wounds of our own particular being.
while working together towards the betterment of all Creation. .

May the blasts of the shofar heralding in the year 5746 penetrate our innermost
being, and inspireus to renew our faith in G-d and the G-dlmess inherent in each 3 r

, other.
