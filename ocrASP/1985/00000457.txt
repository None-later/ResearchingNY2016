Seattle, Wa.
(CPS) Last spring. when it decided to limit
its investments in companies that do
business in South Africa, the University of
Washington’s Board of Regents thought it
was ridding itself of a headache. ‘

All it really did was create a new one for »

itself.

While the board mufﬂed most students
dissatisfaction by promising to invest only
in companies which pledge to follow the
Sullivan Principles. it foung itself without
a way to tell if the companies that signed
the principles - a list of civil rights the
firms agree to respect in their South
African operations - are practicing what
they preach.

it’s a problem that more and more coi-
leges are facing this fall as they begin to
cave in to student and faculty pressure to
sever or moderate ties to apartheid in
South Africa.

The American Committee on Africa
claims 53 colleges have sold $206 million in
interests in companies with South African
operations since 1977. Eighteen schools
have sold off $62 million in the last year
ai0ne.

At least 100 colleges. instead of selling
their stocks, have sworn to invest only in
firms that pledge to uphold the Sullivan
Principles. according to a College Press
Service estimate.

“The easiest way for schools to (chorse
their South Africa) investments is juSL to
use the Sullivan ratings." contended David
Hauk of the investor Responsibility
Research Committee (lRRC). “Just say
‘anyone who hasn't signed. we won’t in-
vest in'."

But few svhools can trek to South Africa
themselves to see if the companies are
cbmplying with the principles they have
signed.

Many hire agencies to grade the com-
panies' performance. but some activists

dismiss the agencies’ objectivity and ac-
curacy. The problems in monitoring com-
pliance with the Sullivan Principles. they
conclude, make the principles useless.

But campus governors. left withouta
choice; usually hire an agency to monitOr
the companies in South Africa anyway.

Washington, as well as 85 to 90 other
colleges, hired “the lRRC working in con-
junction with the Arthur D. Little Con~
suiting ﬁrm in Boston," explained Robert
Mathane. UW’s treasurer.

“The lRRC provides a constant flow of
information," he said. “We use their list
to check companies in our portfolio.
You'll ﬁnd schools mostly are adopting
this system (of monitoring investments)."
Schools with investments of $25 million or

lesspay theilRRC $660 a year. and “it _

goes up according to the value of the port:
folio," Hauk said.

in return. the lRRC sends subscribing I
schools reports of how the companies that ‘
signed the principles are treating their ‘

workers. “We visit companies'in South

Africa." Hauk reported. “We talk to ‘

union ofﬁcials. inVestigate and compare

Hauk stressed the lRRC won’t rate com-
panies doing business in South Africa.
Colleges with questions about speciﬁc
companies ask Arthur D. Little. which will
formulatevanswers based on the informa-
tion gathered by the lRRC.

Leon Sullivan. who authored _ the
Sullivan Principles, also runs a group that
reports corporate behavior in South Africa
back to American colleges. '
