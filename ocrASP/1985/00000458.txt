“l think there is growing
evidence that the student debt
burden is affecting the lives and
consumer patterns of bor-
rowers." Mitch'em noted. “And
it also appears to be affecting the
number of students who don't go
on to grad school because they are
already so heavily in debt.”

Female, minority, and low in-
come students are hit the hardest,
he said, because they typically
borrow more to attend school,
and earn lower salaries when they
graduate.

taintedbyaiddebts;

’-andls'purchasincharssr out. “it can be shown that most

poor, and minority students never
earn their bachelor’s degrees; so
they are stuck with repaying aid
debts for an education they never
finished.”
" Mitchem, along with many
other aid experts, blames the
federal government’s increased
reliance on loans over grants :for
the problem. In the early 1970's.
nearly two-thirds of all student
aid money was awarded in direct,
non~repayable grants to students.
But today, nearly two-thirds of all
student aid money is loaned.
Besides increasing grant
money, the government should
also stop increasing loan limits,
Mitchem added, “because it
would only allow more students

to borrow more than they are a

capable of repaying. "

But the American Council on
Education disagrees. and recently
asked the House Postsecondary

raise Guaranteed Student Loan
annual limits. from $2500 to
$3000. ‘

“There’s a lot of concern over
student debt, but there is also a
lot of concern over the fact that
loan limits aren’t keeping pace
with college costs," explained
ACE policy analyst Scott Miller.

“A lot of people want the limits
doubled," he said. “We’re
recommending what we thinkis a
reasonable increase in limits. but
not one that is big enough to add
signiﬁcantly to the debt burden
problem."
