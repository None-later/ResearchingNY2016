"Frosh Will face.
new kinds 'of
stress this year

(CPS) Students entering school this fall
will encounter stresses they've never
dealt with before, and will probably en-
dure regular “academic calendar of
stress" periods before they finish col-
lege, a new University of Utah study
revealed.

“Students are away from home,

many for the first time, and dealing with
pressures and responsibilities they've
never had before,” explained study co-
author Neal Whitman, a researcher with
the University’s Department of Family
Planning. '
’ At the same time, though, students
experience less serious stress because
they have greater control over their lives
than their non-student peers in the real
world, according to the summary study
of over l50 major stress reports.

"Stress is directly related to how
much control you have over your life,”
said Whitman, “and let’s face it, a col-
lege student has a lot of control." Going
to college itself is a matter of choice.
You control your use of time, decide
what classes to t: re and how to study.”

Still, COIICSL .as plenty of pressures
and stresses, many of which affect
students at certain times and places in
their educations. Last spring a Michigan
State study reported that students - like
their counterparts with full-time jobs -
often become frustrated, apathetic and
burned~out.

Law and medical students, with more
intense schedules and greater focus on
jobs, tend to feel more pressures than
liberal arts majors, the Utah study said.
A recent Louisiana State study showed
that medical school often proves
“hazardous to the health of many
students" who are unable to handle the
stresses and pressures that come with the
degree.

“The job market is the most signifi-
cant trigger of stress for studen.s,” said
Whitman, “particularly for exiting and
professional students. And we have also

Tie lines which used to connect the
academic podium and uptown quads are
being reinstalled this month after the ser-
vice was cut off when the University in-
stalled a new phone system this past
summer.

' A second system, called the Centrex III,
has been leased from New York Telephone/
to make the hook-up possible. All podium
phones are run on a seperate machine
which was put into service June 7th, accor-
ding to Director of Telephone Systems
Gary Pelton.

Before June 7, the University had-

operated two systems one for the dorms
and one for administrative offices.
Because both systems were owned by New
York Telephone, tie-lines were readily
available.‘ .

Except for the lack of tie-lines, most
people agree the new system is convenient
and has many attractive features, such as
teleconferencing, forward, and ring-aga’in
capabilities.

According to Bill McCann, Chair of
Student Associations (SA) Central Coun-
cil.“ From SA’s point of view it is a big ex-
pense for us [not having tie-lines since the
summer]. it is imperative that we contact
students for meetings and events. There is
a definite need for free intra—campus calls
via tie-lines.”

“Centrex Iii will again tie the University

to the uptown dorms. However, there will
be a time message rate (tmr) to call the
downtown campus,” saidPelton. The use
of Centrex ill will hopefully alleviate the
anxieties facing SA, and other student
groups.
, The main reason for the telephone con-
version is money, According to Pelton,
“We’re saving enough money to more
than justify the transition. We are cost-
avoiding in addition to cost-saving,” he
said . '

The cost of the SLl-XN and the Centrex
"I is approximately $3.2 million. in addi-
tion, “the new telephone system has made
enhancements to our calling capabilities,"
said Pelton. -

Pelton said that the “students are not

system. It is mainly for university use.
Financially, it would have been a terrible
burden for them.”

The university faculty and staff have the
advantage to dial the downtown campus
via fiberoptic cables without charge. This
benefit shall only last until Centrex III is
utilized. Afterwhich, a time message rate.
of approximately 5.08 for the first five
minutes. and $.01 each additional minute,
will be in effect. The cables also permit full
motion video capabilities and
teleconferencing. 'Rita Levine, Director
of Operations for SA, feels that “the new
system is_better that the old. There is con-
cern, however, that the new system will be
expensive for SA until the tie~lines are put
in." At least ninety calls a week are made
to students, many of which live in the up-
town dorms, said Levine.

According to McCann, SA was op-
timistic about the new telephonesystem,
“the telephones live up to our expecta-

tions. Therqare more options for i'nterof-
ﬁce transferring and interoffice workings
with the new system." . ,

SUNY students have already established
opinions on the new telephone sytem. “i
think it’s ridiculous that we're unable to
call the dormitories from the Campus
Center. It used to be a big convenience. If
the line is busy students must dial 8
numb'ers instead of 4 to get through,” said
irene ‘Grinberg.

Steven Levin, aneeconomics major, said
that “many students find dialing 9 plus the
whole phone number a big hassle. Besides
that, l haven’t‘noticed any deterioration in
the quality of the service.”

Problems with the new telephones, con-m

tinuous ringing and poor transmission
have occurred, said Peltonpbut were iron-
ed out during the summer months to avoid
any problems when school opened.
“Significant problems, however.vhave not
occurred," he added.

Young helps lift NYPIRG projects off the ground

Young has return- 

ed to campus to act -

as the New York 
Public interest

Research Group’s (NYPIRG’s)
Project Coordinator (PC) for this
campus.

The position as PC was an ideal
opportunity for Young, who ex-
plained that “activism for me is
something that is very energizing.
The job can be draining and
simultaneously energizing. i don't
have to wait to live my life until
after work.”

Young said she feels her job as
PC is “ultimately going to be one
of assisting students in getting
projects off the ground."

“i will act as a resource and of-
fer my cxpericnce and help
students decide what they want to
do and how they should do it.
The chapter really belongs to the
students." Young added, “i'm
here to make sure they go through
the proper channels and make
sure the Albany chapter coor-
dinates with others. i will act as a
liaison between this campus and
other campuses across the state."

in the Albany Times-Union she
sent in an application to
NYPlRO's New York City had
quarters. After three interviews in
New York City, she was hired in
August as a part of the NYPiRO
stuff.

A week of training in New
York City and a week of training
at a camp in Peeksklll provided

“qty rpm.

    

various issues that NYPIRG deals
with, and various types of media
work. “This training will be part
of the experience I’ll share with
the students," she said.

Young has very strong views
about student activism. “1 think
it’s really important for students
to be active because they need to
take an active role in shaping the
world."

Apathy, in Young's opinion, is
a problem that exists but which
has been greatly overemphasized.
“There is a lot of activism as well
as apathy. The reason a lot of
students are apathetic is because
they don’t feel they can make a
difference," she said.

“Apathy,” she explained,
“comes from a sense of pur-
poselessness and if students are
taught the necessary skills they
can be changed from apathetic to
active.”

“‘Get involved in anything,”
Young urged students, “even if it
isn’t NYPIRG."

Young observed that students
are far too often viewed as one
part of society - the university
community. "issues such as
financial aid affect them as
students. while an issue like toxic
dumps effect them as citizens of
their community, and an issue
like apartheid effects them as
citizens of the world. Activism

places," she added.

According to Young, much of
the misunderstanding that crop-
ped up last year about NYPIRG
stems from the fact that people
misunderstand what it means to
be active. “Some people are so
leery about what it actually means
to be active, that they associate
this fear with NYPIRG," she
said.

in order to allay some of these
fears, Young feels reaching peo-
ple is essential. “The more we can
talk to people and tell them what
NYPIRG is really all about, that
apprehension dissipates. Most
people don’t understand that
NYPIRG is non-partisan and they
don’t understand the issues
represented by NYPIRG.”

Returning to SUNYA as an
employee of NYPIRG rather than
as a student at the University has
been interesting for Young, and
her past involvement with the
University has proved most
helpful to her. “Although i'm
not a student anymore, i am still
very much in touch with student
life and i am familiar with student
government, administrators,
faculty. it's beneficial to know
what goes on here at the Universi-
ty," she added.

Last year, Young acted as Stu-
dent Association's (SA’s) Media
Director and was resposlble for

‘ﬁonnwarisyr'vrrrrruavvvwimssr.nisvs>wt):Vyyvyi~,.ygti,r,,,;,;,;,

tions and speech writing for the
SA president.

'Her dedication to activism cer-
tainly did not end there. Young
was also widely involved in a
number of on- and off-campus
women's groups, including the
Women’s Studies Advisory Com-
mittee where she served on the
search committee for a new
Women’s Studies director.

In her sophomore and junior
years at SUNYA, Young par-
ticipated in the introduction to

Feminism Teaching Collective."

Her work with the Women’s Af-
ﬁnity Group included a civil
disobedience workshop and par-
ticipation at the Seneca Women’s
Peace Encampment.
0n campus, Young also con-
tributed to the preliminary studies
of the Women’s Safety Task
Force, which included the Don’t
Walk Alone Escort Service
among its suggestions. '
“For too long and in too many
ways students have not been
taken seriously and students
haven’t taken themselves serious-
ly," said Young. "Students have
a right and a responsibility to be
pro-active rather than reactive in
terms of how they relate to others
and their environment," she
added. '
“There is no speciﬁc point at

which you stop being a student
and start becoming part of the
world," she said, adding “it's im-
portant for students to see
. themselves as not just individuals
but as part of a large

community." . ‘

~ Young said she has noted many

differences between SA and
NYPIRG. “SA is concerned
about students as students on the
SUNY Albany campus whereas
NYPIRG is concerned with
students as citizens in the world.

Both are important organizations
to have on campus."

While Young has never
previously participated in
NYPIRG, she agrees with its pur-
pose for existence. “The most im-
portant thing to me is to be able
to make changes that are needed.
NYPIRG's philosophy is to
make; or try to make changes
when they see consumers and
citizens being taken advantage of

by government or business."

There are some aspects of
NYPIRG which Young feels need
attention. “Although NYPIRG
doesn't address all the issues i feel
are important they still make
some important changes
possible."

One area Young feels NYPIRG

- aren’t

should spend more time dealing
with is women’s issues. “As much
as i ,am disappointed that they
involved with women’s
issues, i really feel hopeful that
that can be changed because their
ideology isn’t concrete,” she add—
ed, “l’m hoping to add women’s
issues to the entire organization as
well as just in this chapter."
