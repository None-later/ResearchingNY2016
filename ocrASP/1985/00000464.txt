,One of the besteways for students to
cope with college stress is byorganizing
and planning their'tir'ne, the Utah's'tudy
suggested. “Doa little planning, get
organized, and take time to think about
what you: are? doing,” Whitman
recommended. g - ., . a ,  

Students should also eat. exercise.
sleep properly. and take time to talk
with family,, friends. and peers about.
the stresses they. feel. “And get involved
in helping other students,” Whitman
Suggested. “It’s a  irony. but the
students doing .the helping- whether it's.
tutoring, crisis counseling, or per-
ticipatin'g in group sessions- get the best
help themselves because they see that
stresses can be managed.”_ ‘ g '

I . A group of Yale students last year
even formed their own “Stress Busters"
massage service, which for $20 provided t

*“non‘és‘exu’al. "legitimate" bodyt

massages to help students relax and un-
wind during finals.”

And Boston University researchers
recently reported that students can have
clearer complexions if they lea'mto relax
and control stress, which they say causes

hormones. ~

directories totcome out in order to contact

old friendsI will have to wait until the end
of October, according to Gary Pelton of
the Telecommunications Office.

Pelton said. “this year we have issued a
second directory for administration lines

jfaculty and administrative lines should be
back nexttyear. Pelten said. “next year

we‘ll go back to a single-directory." The
