More than apples and honey.) , I
It is customary” to eat apples  in honey‘on Rosh
Hashana 'to express our wishes for a sweet New Year.

But we can't depend on godd wishes alone in a difficult
world where life isn't always all apples and honey.

Unlike the secular new year, Rosh Hashana has a unique
mood of its Own It is happy and festive. but without
frivolous partying and merry making. We take :Rosh Hashana
seriously. Rosh Hashana is the time for prayerful introspec-
tion. to become better ourselves for a better new year.

That is the message of the Shofar-the' ram's horn that is
blown on Rosh Hashana. According to the great Maimonides.
"The Sounding of the Shofar is a.Divine commandment V "
which carries a message. The'shofar calls ‘...Awaken you
sleepers from. your sleep. and‘arise. Search your deeds. repent
and remember your Creator....do not forget the Truth in pass-
ing vanities...wasting time-without accomplishment...search
your souls and improve your ways.-..Everything hangs in
balance...Even a single Mitzva can save a person and the
whole world..."

We may all hear the Shofar on Rosh Hashana-but are we
listening?

Best wishes for a very sweet and happy New Year.
Rabbi Moshe Chanowitz

A new Student Association Central

Council investigative subcommittee Will,

turn its first efforts to examining SA's
Transportation Committee, it was an:

meeting. -

nounced at Wednesday night's Council

The. internal Affairs committee's Sub- ‘
committee on investigationerversight .

and Analysis (10A) has been the subject of
a small “memo-war" within SA, accor-

ding to Internal Affairs Chair Steve Russo,

who came up with the ideafor 10A. '-
Russo said that after‘h'e and Internal Af-
fairsf-Vice Chair Nate Charhey announced
the subcommittee at the August Council
meeting,'he recieved a memo from SA’s‘

‘ Executive Branch‘expressing concem' that

lOA would exercise a judicial function. In
addition. the memo stated, r “Should a‘
report‘defame or slander an ofﬁcerin any

matter without proper evidence, 'we are' '

prepared to take the members of your sub-
committee to the Civil Court.” ‘

“I think they’re (the Executive Branch)
afraid-that in the wrong hands the subcom-
mittee could tee off at them, [with] per-
sonal attacks." said Russo.

The [CA will not exercise any judicial
function. , Russo maintained, because the
subcommittee is going to be issuing reports
only. “If anyone thinks we're all wet
they’ll pan the report," he said. “No one

. can get impeached because of it, _no one

can basically do anything."

“The concern of some members of SA
was that the committee did not need to be
formed,” said SA President Steve Gawley.

The reference to civil court, he said,‘was
included in the ﬁrst memo because of wor-
ries over possible liable or slander. “If you
issue a report on some individual’s office
and you don’t back it up, you’ve got pro-

  
investigative. 

  

Stove Russo ‘
' blems," he stated. ,
However, Oawley said, thesubcommit-

' tee could be beneﬁcial if it is careful to‘.
consider its impact. “I think it will help ex- '

amine some of our policies."

; “‘l think it's a good service that they can
"provide, what we did was fully delineate
our concerns," Gawley added.’

“All the subcommittee can do is report
to Internal and Council," Charney stated.
Charny will chair the new subcommittee,
Russo said. r

Transportation policy was chosen as the
ﬁrst topic, Russo said. because of cortcerns
that there have beenabuses‘ of the SA van
in “1} past: “There is a transportation
policy '..hich covers the van, rented cars,
things like that - but it’s very muddled,"
he added. ' ‘

Future topics of investigation, Russo
said, may include Election Regulations
and the SA Budget Process. V

'ticlpate in SARC. “Sometimes we don't »

know what‘ SA is doing’f about cultural, i
and political issues like '21.’ she said. ' '

Having a Fuerza‘ Latina delegate at
SARC meetings will insure that the Coali-
tion addresses issues concerning

. Hispanicsr added Pion.

The general student population at
SUNYA will also be encouraged to par-

’ ticipate in SARC by voluntarily adding

their nam to a telephone list.
“We're not demanding a Strong com-

. mitment’f from students who sign the list.

said Gawley, noting that those who sign up _

' will be kept informed about protests of

“broad-based issues like (SUNYA's)
alcohol policy which could be the most
pertinent issue of the semester."

Members of the SA ad-hoc Committee ‘

for Student Empowerment created by
Gawley for recruitment purposes will go
door-to-do‘oron the five quads.September
- 29 and 30.:soliciting student participation. 1

*-SARC representatives “will try- to
mobilize students in opposition to‘policies
of the University and the City govern-

 ment,“ said Gawley, But, Gawleycaution-
ed, student activism doesn’t-necessarily in-

volve antagonism. “We reserve the right to
intellectually protest," he said. '

Currently. SA'has a good relationship
with City and University ofﬁcials. said
Gawley. The City has addressed our con-
cerns over polling places and the ‘Grouper
Law'," he' stressed.

According to Mark _ Pearlstein. a
member of the Committee for Student
Empowerment. the sign up at the year's
ﬁrst quad board meetings was “higher
than anything ever done before." Pearls-
tein said that he felt SARC could attract
more than 2,000 students. “We are a force
to be heard." he said.

“Not everybody reads the ASP or the
Student Voice or talks to people in SA at
the same time. This is a way to keep them

. informed before the issues come up,” said

CI p Pearistein.

 "This is-ha'hging together better than we
thought." said Gawley, adding that he
hopes the organization is going to be

f‘ around for many years.

New dorms

SFront Page '

of living in’the‘ dormitories, reported .the
Times-Union article. ‘

According to Poguc, another decision to
be made by the facility planning committee
concerns ground-breaking. “We would
like to involve the campus in the celebra-
tion of ground-breaking.” he said.
“Alumni House is the only new thing built
in the 13 years I’ve been here, and that.
isn’t even on University property," he
added. ‘

“It will be a happy occassion, to say the
least, to break ground,” Pogue said.

“llm really happy we'll have extra
dorms. Any extra living space for students
is a positive thing," said Abelow.

Gawley stressed that “the facility is go-
ing to be a big bonus for‘us in our efforts
to lessen some of the burden of over-
crowding in downtown areas." [I]
