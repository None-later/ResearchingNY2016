single-lancd'track, which will run along the
perimeter.

The Bubble will be in full use by the spr-
ing semester. according to William Moore.
Director of Athletics. “It remains to be
seen how ‘many intercollegiate athletics can
go at once," said Moore, adding that this
type of multi-purposc bubble is fairly
unique.

Similar bubbles, said Moore, usually
house only one sport. such as "swimming or
tennis. The extent of the Bubblc's
capabilities are still questionable, said
Moore, especially when baseball. lacrosse,
and tennis might all be being played at
once.

The roof of the arena will be made of a
heavy-duty. white, vinyl—nylon fabric. The
curved shape of the Bubble and the in-
sulated roof will prevent the collection of
snow on the structure.

According to Stevens. the bubble will be
kept up by a fall-safe inflation system.
Two water proofcd blowers and a heating
system will maintain the pressure in the
bubble and keep the roof in place.

At the bottom of the roof , which covers
the entire arena. anchors will be installed
to keep the vinyl-nylon in place during
high winds. added Stevens. 13
