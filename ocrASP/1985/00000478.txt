New York State students who
default on their state-guaranteed
student loans may soon be finding
themselves handing over their tax -
refunds to the Higher Education
Services Corporation (HESC) as
part of new collection procedures
being instituted.

in recent months the federal
government has also announced
plans to have the internal
Revenue Service hold back tax
refunds if federal loans are not
repaid. Recent data from the US.
Department of Education in-
dicate that New York's percen-
tage increase in defaults has been
only half that of the national
average, which is 40 percent.

According to HESC, the drop
is the result of new methods of
notification about student loans
nearing default and more ag-
gressive collection programs. The
plan to withhold state tax refunds
is the latest innovation.

Arlene Olinsky, a HESC Pro-
gram Research Specialist said
surveys were sent out last year to

   
 
   
 

 

D FRIDA y, SEPTEMBER 20; 1985

HESC’s newloan collection program pays on 

students who have either
graduated or dropped out of col-
lege in an attempt to find out why
students fail to pay their loans.

“The primary cause, although
it seems pretty obvious,” she
said, is that many students have a
hard time ﬁnding jobs after
graduation, and therefore are
unemployed.

As a result of the survey, Olin-
sky said, HESC has determined
that “defaulters are much more
likely not to be employed when
their loans come due," and that
defaulters have borrowed less
(money) in total than repayers, on
the average." >

The survey also found the
defaulters have attended school
for a fewer number of years,
which makes it harder for them to
find jobs. said Olinsky.

The rise in number of

.defaulters .in recent years. she

said, was not necessarily unex-
pected. “The reason why the
number of defaulters have grown,
is that, obviously, there have been
more loans made as the' years
have gone on."

Lolans made frotn the

 

 

Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL)
program'in ﬁscal 1980 totaled
$875.6 million, but by 1984-85
,that ﬁgure went to $987.2 million,
Olinsky saidg Defaults'for 1980‘
were around the 56.3 million
mark, with that ﬁgure rising to
$l57.5 million in 1984-85 against,
collectins of only $359 million.
Donald Whitlock, director of
Financial Aid at SUNYA said
that about 1,200 students a year
borrow on the National Direct
Student Loan (NDSL) program
and- about 5.500 on the GSL
program; '
“The number of loans since
l981-82 has decreased," he said,
“because of changes imposed by

'the Reagan administration.

However, since the initial decline
in 1982-83, GSL remains fairly
constant at about 5,500 [students]
per year.” '
‘ . He added that ‘fwhile the ‘
number of loans remains constant
because of a restrictive economie
means test, the amount of loans
(in dollars) has declined
somewhat.”

The University, Whitlock said,
will not be directly affected by the

defaulters, but, “a student in
default may not receive additional
aid and therefore may be unable
to attend, which may thus effect
enrollment. ’ "

Collection of outstanding loans
is not the responsibility of HESC
which, according to Olinsky, does
not send threatening notices to
defaulters. “Before we even pur-
chase the loan that is in default-
from the banklor lender,” she
said, “the bank muist form a
series of procedures for collection
which is known as “due
dil'igence’."

The bank must contact the bor-
rower to make sure that the per
son knows how much their loan
was. what amounts‘ payments
should be and what the conse-
quences of failure to pay would
be, Olinsky said. There are also
certain legitimate deferments the'
bank can make and unemploy.
ment is one of them, she added.

if repayment has not begun.
HESC purchases the loans from
the bank and tries to contact the
student, Olinsky said. “Aside
from that," she explained, “a
state employee who is in default

can voluntarily take a reduction
out of his pay." About 450 bor-
rowers are participating in the
state payroll deduction program,
she added.

if a judgement is rendered
against a defaulter in court,- said
Olinsky, then HESCis entitled to
that person’s state income tax re-
fund, something which the
Education Department has
already been enforcing, she
added. i

“if they’re having a state'in-
come tax refund, they are ob-
viously employed and they have
an obligation — they have to
repay," she said.

Onthe basis of the survey
results. said Olinsky, HESC also
made certain recommendations to
the Federal govemméht about
allowing longer deferment
periods for people who are
unemployed.

HESC itself is plannin addi-
tional actions to prevent‘dgfaults,
such as alerting students Who are
leaving school about themobliga-
tions to repay the loan thgpugh a
