Catholic students recalled the tnow-destroyed Chapel House at e on

memorial service Wednesday nIg t.

Catholic council designed

CURRY UPS

to increase student 

By David Werthelm
murmur ASSISTANT

The University’s Catholic community at
Chapel House has formed a formal “Com-
muntiy Council” to help SUNYA’s large
Roman Catholic student population with
both other Chapel House groups and the
National Catholic Student Coalition.

“Both (Sister Nancy Langheart) and
myself felt that we would like to have more
student involvement," said Father Jack
Molyn, a Chapel House board member
who help form the council. “The students
have said the same thing to us." he added.

_ “Basically we are very interested in hav~
ing more input on decision-making," said
Langhart.

According to Molyn, Roman Catholic
students represent approximately 35 per-
cent of the SUNYA student body.

“Although we do not have a parish, we
do have quite an active community and
this is the basis for the community," said
Langhart.

The idea for a community council came
about last October. “Nancy and I . . .l
sound like Reagan when I say that. . .
discussed the forming of a council for
students last October. But it was Mike
Racz that helped us start one," said
Molyn.

Racz, a SUNYA student. attended the
National Catholic Student Coalition
meeting in Florida in January 1985. “The
second meeting will be this January and
will be in New Orleans. It would be to our

September council meeting.

The meeting dealt with the issues ,of
writing a constitution for the club in order
to gain Student Association recognition
and possibly funding also.”_ .1...

According to the minutes of the
meeting, the council decided to maintain
four groups. Those include a Constitution
committee. a Service Projects and Peace
and Justice committee, an Education Pro-
grams committe and a Social Committee. .

“We’re brand new here." explain '
Molyn, referring to his and Langhart’s re-.
cent association with Chapel House, ad-i
ding that “we want the students to have a;
series of groups to be involved in. We're;
here to serve them, and this is what will
serve them.” i

The Roman Catholic branch of Chapel
House is currently the only christian group I
to have a student committee. The‘
Episcopalian and Baptist groups do not?
have similar organizations. .

“What would happen last year." said I
Molyn, “is that Nancy and i would send 1'
around a bunch of sign-up sheets in order iv
to determine student preference. We .
would hold an event and be unsure of how .~
many kids would show up. Now we have a
better idea of attendance.”

“No more freezing brownies or running
out to buy more. Now the students will

help us to help them." Molyn said. D

Do any of the following situa-
tions sound;familiar? You arrive
at your off-campus apartment on
September 'to. find that the
landlord has failedto make any
of the repairs s/he promised when
the lease was signed. or, you ar-

r l v e o n ,

look closely at '

the apartment The
for the first Law

time and realize »
that (take your choice) there are
no closets. no windows, no locks
or no shower. Or, youespend your
first nightin the apartment only
to realize that that quaint little
bar downstairs, the Lamp Post, is
in fact one of the most crowded
and noisy night spots in Albany.

If any of these stories sound
familiar, to you, you may be
among. the students asking,
“How can I get out of my lease?"
This is a common quesion in the
Student Legal Services office at
thegibeginning of each academic
year. This article will present
some general answers to this ques-
ti ' ., Remember that every situa-
ti _ is unique and that a brief ar-

ticle cannot answer specific ques-

tions. If you are having a problem
with-your apartment or a dispute
with your landlord you should
contact an attorney.

There is no automatic or easy
way to get out ‘of a lease. This is
why it is so important to inspect
an“ Eapartment “liHi‘efully before
signing a lease, and to have the
landlord put in writing all pro-
mises regarding repairs.

“The best way to get out of a

lease, although it is rarely
available as animation, is if the
landlord agrees to release you
from your obligations. The par-
ties to a contract, such asa lease,
are always free to 'modify or’te'r-
minate the agreement, butthis re-
quires the consent of all parties. If.
you want to get out of your lease
the ﬁrst step is to speak to the
landlord and attempt to reach an r
agreement. Any agreement you
reach should be put in writing. . _
If the landlord won’t agree to
release you from the lease, New
York State law allows a tenant to
vacate an apartment without in-
curring any additional obligations
if theepartment is uninihabitable.
In order to make use of this law,
called “constructive eviction,"

’ the apartment must be totally

uninhabitable. This law is
generally not available as an
option.

Another possible way to get out
of a lease is to “assign” your

lease to someone else. This means '

that another person takes over
your rights and obligations under
the lease. Sometimes landlords
agree to assignments. If your
landlord refuses to consent, you
might still have a right under New
York state law to assign the lease.
The law regarding assignments is
complex and you should consult
an attorney in this type of
situation.

A “sub—lease" is similar to an
assignment, except that you re-
main responsible under the lease
and can be held liable by your
landlord if the sublessee fails to

'pay the rent. As with
