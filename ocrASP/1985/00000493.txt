Now, if wrds, wrods,
worrds or wo ords fail you, this
typewriter won't. The new
Smith Corona with Spell-Right
dictionary. It has an exclusive
electronic correction system
that actually detects mistakes
before you do. Or better yet,
before someone else does.
Advanced, yes. But it’s as sim-
ple as...

Beep! You’ve just mis-
spelled a word. While you type,
your spelling is constantly
checked against a built-in elec-
tronic dictionary. You’re warned
with a beep the instant you
misspell or mistype a word. Can
you outspell Spell—Right?
Unlikely. It’s programmed with
35,000 words, 4 times the
average vocabulary.

The Find feature zeros
in on the mistake anywhere on
the line. If you've made several
mistakes, it ﬁnds them, too!

WordEraser'M lifts the
whole word off. Just touch once

for one word. Twice for two.
WordEraser correction even
lets you type in the new word
while it erases the old.

There are more futuris-
tic features, too. Automatic
Relocate, Auto Return, Auto
Centering, Express Backspace,
and Automatic Underline.

Also, Dual Pitch, Pro-
grammable Margins, Tabs and

electronic end-of—page warning.

With optional Messenger
module, it even becomes a 10
cps letter— quality printer when
you hook it up to your computer.
There’s one more fea-
ture you’ll like. The price. This
advanced portable is incredibly
affordable, which makes Spell-
Right more than just a techno-
logical breakthrough. It makes
Smith Corona the w“ '
smartest typewriter
you can buy.
