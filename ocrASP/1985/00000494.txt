College Sports: Out of Bounds

The dishonesty underlying much of big-
time college sports threatens the integ—
rity of higher education. Finally,college
presidents have stepped in to assert con-
trol. The cover story describes the
abuses—and the cleanup measures. Two
companion articles show that honesty can
pay: one explains how Notre Dame wins
fairly; the other proﬁles former Oklaho-
ma basketball star Wayman Tisdale.

Photojournalism: An Eye for the Moment
Photojournalists serve two masters: art and journalism.
Their images include timely news pictures and timeless
feature photos. In a portfolio of student photojournal-
ism. assembled by Newsweex ON CAMPUS Photo
Editor Nia Krikellas, the subjects range from women
football players to a man dying of cancer. Page 24

Hampshire College Goes Its Own Way

No grades, no credits, no ﬁxed academic programs—that‘s the
Hampshire College way. When the school ﬁrst admitted
students in 1970. this approach got mixed notices. But these
days, thanks to an emphasis on “entrepreneurship,” educators
see a model in Hampshire, the college where being nontradi-

tional is already a tradition.

‘It’s Time to Get Out and Raise a Little Hell’
Eleanor Smeal, once again the president of the National Organi-
zation for Women. vows to carry her cause to the streets——and the
campuses. But she knows it will be hard to get her message across to
students. a majority of whom supported Ronald Reagan. In an
. interview, Smeal contends that most college women have not yet felt
‘ ' - ' the sting ofdiscrimination. Page 41

Paying for School With Good Looks

Working your way through college at $2,500 a day
doesn't sound like a bad deal. But the life ofa student-
model is often more strenuous than glamorous, and
getting :1ij is usually harder than doing one. Still.
opportunities exist all over the country—you may

even be discovered on campus.

Arts and Entertainment: A Geek Baring Gifts

Now in his fourth season on “Night Court." Harry Anderson is
turning the geek and the con man into an art form. Scottish rock trio
The Blue Nile offers an evocative debut album. CBS's “Hometown”
is Yuppie television. Garrison Keillor takes us back to “the little
town that time forgot“—Lake Wobegon. Minn. Wayne Wang‘s new
ﬁlm tenderly dissects a Chinese-American family. Page 52
