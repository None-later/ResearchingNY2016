Crackdown on Drinking
I\vouldliketocommendNEWSWEEKON
CAMPUS for the excellent and informative
report on the problem ofdrinking on college
campuses (LIFE/STYLE). Your statistics did

The Vermont State Legislature has re-
cently voted down a raise in the drinking
age. It‘s nice to know that some states have
the guts to oppose unfair federal govern-
ment restrictions.

It‘s good to know that some colleges and
universities are getting tough and laying
down harsh drinking laws because so many
young people lose their lives each year as a
result oi‘drunken driving. More often than
not it isn't the drunken driver who‘s fatally
injured but the sober victim; too many
young people don‘t know when to stop

’ drinking arid their friends don‘t know how

to stop them from driving. Articles like

yours may make them think before they
drink and drive.

Ifa ntan can risk his life for his country
arid vote on who runs it, he should be able to
enjoy it glass of wine with dinner. If the
drinking age is raised to 21. their I say, raise
the draft attd voting age along with it.

Society needs to revamp its attitude to-
ward alcohol and treat it with the respect it
deserves. The emphasis should be on being
responsible. Ii' art 18-year-old can be pros-

South Carolina sophomore Kathcrinc
Morgan‘s logic is faulty: students do Itot
ltandlcalcohol responsibly and they do Itot
view the issues of marriage, abortion and
drinking with equal gravity. Drinking and .
getting drunk has never been tut issue of

‘ responsibility with students. Rather. it is It ‘

hobby. a kick viewed with about as much I.
sobriety as at weekly bowling icttgttc. Utttil I

the consumption ofalcohol is taken serious-
ly by students and discarded as an inalicn- I
able rite of passage to adulthood, the 2i- *
year-old drinking age is smart, possibly .

lifesaving, legislation.

Education and drinking certainly don’t
mix. Furthermore, you don't have to drink
to be a man, as ProfessorRada has proven to
us. Keep up the good work, Professor Radai

Thank you for “Crackdown on Drink-
ing.“ I especially enjoyed the picture of
Professor Rada. ls he the only decent pro-
fessor in UCLA or is he the only brave one?

Your article missed the point by repre-
senting the student life-style through an ig-
Itorant few who show poor judgment. An
important repercussion ofraising thedrink-

Our social life will be restricted to movies,
dry fraternities and all-ages clubs teeming

The Unappreciated R.A.’s
I appreciated Bob Garrison‘s “Let's Hear
It for R.A.‘s" (MY’I‘URN). For more than 20
years I have done pastoral work among
students, and I'm convinced that R.A.‘s are
the most valuable and least appreciated
among those who educate (“lead forth“) at
the college level. They have to live “in the
trenches" and face the early signs ofdcpres-
siort, shame and failure. They also have
access to those teachablc moments when
freedom is granted and cart shape the emer-
gcncc of self-governing community. The
successes ofAmcrican residential campuses
depend more on these people and their su-
pervisors than most outsiders can imagine.

I‘m glad that It major magazine took the
lime arid space to present this article be-
cause so many people don't understand the
situations that R.A.‘s deal with dttily.
