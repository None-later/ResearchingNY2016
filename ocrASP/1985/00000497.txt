readers to know that in 1980 Prof. Sheila

Manes and I introduced a course on the

1960s in American history. More than 100

students enrolled to learn why America

nearly came apart during the turbulent dec-
ade of the 19605 and its aftermath.

South African Divestment
The recent student demonstrations
against apartheid in South Africa and the
divestment drive by the universities reek of
hypocrisy (BUSINESS). If the students are
concerned about human rights. why aren't
they demonstrating in front of the Soviet
Embassy dnd protesting against the Soviet
noncompliance with the Helsinki accords?
RON M. KAGAN

Long Beacln Calif.

Divestment by itselfdoes not guarantee
that sanctions will be taken against South
Africa. The stocks that American colleges
sell will be bought by others who may not
care about oppression. The alternative is
reinvestment in corporations that will abide
by the Sullivan principles and train blacks
to move up in the hierarchy.

Bennett on Federal Aid
it is interesting that William J. Bennett
espouses “stereo divestiture, automobile di-
vestiture and three-weeks-at-the-bcach di-
Vcslilurc"(N/\‘I‘IONAI. AFFAIRS). But where
is he looking when federally assisted stu-
dents are working 40-plus hours per week
during the summer and working part time
during the school year as well?

it‘s reassuring to be told that a four-year
degree is meaningless. With optimism like
that in the Department of Education. all
college students should quit school and go
flip burgers. Or maybe as graduating high-
school seniors we should have "knocked on
the door of some big company." I've often
heard ofopenings for engineers. architects.
computer programmers and teachers wail-
ing for unskilled 18~year-olds.
