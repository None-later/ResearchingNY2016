about one ofthe ﬁttest athletes in the nation,
that certainly adds to his admissions fold-
er,“ understates John Blackburn of the
University of Virginia. A lesser player.
Blackburn admits, "wouldn't have as much
to contribute to the university.“

The tag of war over athletic admissions
can be gentle and friendly, or it can be
extremely ﬁerce. “There are institutions
where the head coaches have the ability to
simply designate people and tell the uni-
versity they‘re going to be admitted,“ says
the College Board‘s Hargadon. “At some.
if the admissions ofﬁce decides someone
isn‘t eligible and the coach still wants him,
the coach can take it to the president and
the president might overrule the admis-
sions office.“ Ed Wall, dean of admission
and ﬁnancial aid at the University of
Southern California from 1982-84, con-
ﬁrms the end-around play. At USC, Wall
claims, the president can make special dis-
pensation for alumni or trustee children,
kids who might represent heavy ﬁnancial
contributions or athletes. Wall says he re—
calls about eight “presidential admits“ in
his ﬁrst year at USC and about 15 in his
second, perhaps half ofthem athletes with
GPA‘s below 2.0.

Even the Ivy League is not immune,
reports former Princeton admissions dean
James Wickenden. About 10 years ago, he
says, some of the schools in the league
(which is in fact an athletic alliance dating
back only to I954) appeared to be dipping
deeper into the academic pool to get good
athletes—and started winning more. Ivy
admissions directors now have access to
each other‘s applications. And the Council
of Ivy Group Presidents has reafﬁrmed the
league's founding principle of maintaining
no double standard for athletes.

According to Richard Cashwell. direc-
tor of admissions at the University of

North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the inher-

ent conflict is simple: admissions people
tend to want straight-A students, and
those are usually not the best athletes. Says
Indiana's Robert Magee: “We see sortie
weird transcripts, and those kids get irt
someplace.“ That is a nightmare for any
coach, even one who truly believes in hold-
ing tight to a decent academic standard: an
athlete rejected by his school will be ad-
mitted by a rival institution and come back
to beat his team in the last 10 seconds.
Hargadon thinks there must be a book
circulating among coaches that lists 1,000
explanations of why an athletic recruit has
not performed well academically. “They
try and have you in tears,“ says Hargadon.

“That was the fun part—to see
what they would come up with.“
Coach P. J. Carlesimo, who is
trying to build a basketball pro-
gram at Seton Hall that can be
competitive in the powerhouse
Big East conference, sees the
problem clearly. "You're trying
to tnarry two pools," he says.
“You‘ve got your pool of talented
enough players, and you‘ve got
your pool of acceptable students.
They don‘t overlap a real lot. We
can recruit better students, but
we can‘t win playing them."

The NCAA is trying to merge
the two poolsa little more smooth-
ly by encouraging prospective col-
lege athletes to become accept-
able students while still in high
school. Two years ago the associ-
ation passed a controversial rule,
known its Proposition 48, that
would require athletes to show a
2.0 scholastic average in a speciﬁed curricu-
lum of college-prep courses; acing phys ed
and “bachelor living“ wouldn‘t count.
Proposition 48 also calls for student-ath-
letes to earn a combined score of at least 700
on the SAT or 15 on the American College
’l‘csting program exam. Any student who
did not meet those criteria would be ineligi-
ble to play as a freshman. Black colleges——
presidents as well as coaches—protested
the new rule hotly as unfair to black stu-
dents. In 1982, for example, the average
combined score for all black students taking
the SAT was 707 (the average for all stu-
dents is j ust below 900). Some NCAA mem-
bers may propose modiﬁcations, which are
to take effect for the 1986-87 aca-
demic year, without changing the
intent of the rule.

There is also growing senti-
ment, within the commission and
among presidents and coaches
generally, for a return to the days
when freshmen were not eligible at
all for varsity teams. Theoretical-
ly, this would allow freshmen ath-
letes to spend a year acting, more
or less, like other students. They
would have time to get adjusted to
college life rind to devote to their
studies. It might also help improve
graduation rates, another touchy
problem with college athletics.
One recent study conducted for
the NCAA found that of college
athletes entering school in 1975,
42 percent graduated within ﬁve
years. That ﬁgure scents not so bad
compared with the 50 percent ﬁve-
year graduation rate for the stri-
dent population at large, but there
is a trick in it. Most students who
do not graduate either drop out or
flunk out in the first year or two.
