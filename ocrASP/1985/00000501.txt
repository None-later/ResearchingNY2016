school for ﬁve years—until their eligibility
runs out—and are still nowhere near
graduation.

The study also included some other trou-
bling facts. Only about one-quarter of black
male athletes graduated, for instance, and
some single-college rates for basketball
players, many of them black, were abysmal.
At Memphis State, in fact, only 4 of 38
scholarship basketball players have gradu-
ated since 1973, none of them black. “Most
of the players play four years and come out
with about 60 credits that don’t ﬁt any kind
of degree pattern," says Prof. Jerry N.
Boone, a former Memphis State vice presi-
dent. “This is the norm."

The issue of exploitation came into focus
at Memphis State last spring, when a
federal grand jury investigating gambling
and bookmaking in Memphis started look-
ing into the Colonial Country Club. The

club's members include basketball coach
Dana Kirk (who supplements his income
by doing waterbed commercials on Mem-
phis television), former athletic director
Billy (Spook) Murphy and several mem-
bers of the enthusiastic Golden Tiger
booster club—from which the university
disassociated itself last May. Everyone

concerned denies any wrongdoing. But ru-
mors of various illegalities have become so
commonplace that Memphis State has
hired a former FBI agent to conduct his
own investigation as an “adviser to the
president."

No one has been charged, but the sit-
uation has produced some unhealthy
strains. Local black leaders are particularly
appalled because Memphis State’s basket—
ball program has been built largely on the
labors of black athletes from the city’s
streets. "They are taking our kids and
using them," complains Maxine Smith, ex-
ecutive secretary of the Memphis NAACP,
which proposed a resolution at last sum-
mer‘s national NAACP convention calling
for a task force to monitor the problems of
black college athletes. Although Smith
charges that the university "just doesn’t
care," Memphis State has taken at least

 

 

 

 

 

 

Waymau ﬂuid at ham with hispamm: ‘You don’t have to give dirtyfor dirty’

ll Winning team

onor and fortune can come to a univer-
ll sity any number ofways. For the Univer-
sity of Oklahoma, it came recently in a
smiling 6-footu9 package named Wayrnan
Tisdale. A three-time AlI‘Ameriean and
member of the Olympic gold-medal basket-
ball team, Tisdale carried the Sooners to the
upper reaches of the NCAA rankings and at
the same time helped make football-crazy
nLl L I A' I. I L II 'III’ 1 r
tant in an era of grand-jury headlines, he
managed toaccomplish thntwith charmand
grace and no hint of scandal. “Wayman
exempliﬁes what college sports are all
about." says coach Billy Tubbs, "working
hard. doing your very best and having fun.”

Tisdale's success need not be measured
only in games won and postseason awards.
In 1981-82, just before “Mr. T“ arrived, the
school grossed $278,000 in ticket sales onan

 

average attendance of 7,466 per game. Last
season’s gross was $762,000; the average
crowd Was 11,510—in an arena that seats
only 10,800.

Obviously a ﬁgure of stature at Norman,
Tisdale enjoyed the campus social life. But
he roomed with his brother and nearly every
weekend went home to Tulsa to visit his
high-school sweetheart and play guitar at
the Baptist church where his father is minis-
ter. According to his mother, Deborah, not
one of the more than 200 schools that re-
cniited Wayman oﬁ'ered more than an edu-
cation and a chance to play. Any recruiter
who had planned to oﬁ'er more would have
been quickly dissuaded. The family prac-
tices the religious ideals preached by the
Rev. LouisTisdale, who insists that “sport is
s rt. It's good to win, but you don't have to
give dirty fordirty."

 

In truth,Tisdale was probably sold on 0U
long before coach Billy Tubbs knocked on
his door; his older brother William, a high-
school star who injured his knee as a fresh-
man, was one of Tubbs’s ﬁrst recruits. As
Reverend Tisdale puts it, William and Way~
man are “best friends, best brothers, best
everything.” Tubbs. for his part. was en-
tranced by Wayman the ﬁrst time he saw the
youngster play. “I knew he would be really
good forour program, bothas aplayer and as
a person," Tubbs says.

A nd also as a. student. An honor student in
high school, Tisdale maintained about a
2.7 GPA at 0U. Tubbs believes he could
easily have pulled a 3.5 had it not been
for basketball. “An athlete has a number
of constraints," Tisdale explains. “There's
pressure to perform, and the good college
players are expected to perform every night.
Then you're expected to be a normal stu-
dent, but you have twice as much work as
other students.” Tisdale handled the load
with such ease that some 0U fans were
surprised—as well as disappointed—when
he decided to Ieavea year early to turn pro.
The NBA was elated. The Indiana Pacers
snatched Tisdale with the second pickin the
draft and began negotiating a contract that
should be worth millions. Still, the decision
did not come easily for Tisdale. His parents
reportedly wanted him to ﬁnish school ﬁrst,
but the family has rallied behind his deci-
sion. “William encouraged me to do what
I wanted," Wayman says of his brother
and conﬁdant. And his older brother Wel-
don, who went to Yale on a scholarship,
has signed on'as Wayman’s manager. “I
wouldn’t encourage anyone to drop out,"
says Waymsn, who insists that he hasn’t.
“I‘m going to get my degree. It‘ll be written
right into my contract."
