some steps. Former vice president Boone ts
cond ting a study of the school‘s football
and b etball players who didn‘t graduate
and didn't make it to the pros; he hopes to
develop a system to help future athletes
before they drop out. “An institution owes
something to an unsuccessful athlete that it
doesn‘t necessarily owe to an unsuccessful
student,“ Boone says, "in that the athlete
has performed for the university and helped
raise millions ofdollars "

Syracuse University Tim Green, an
All-American defensive tackle and a
Rhodes-scholarship candidate, has an idea
that might help. He points out that many

as well, want to be pro athletes but have
little interest in being students. Rather
than turning them away—or making a
farce of their educational experience—
Green suggests establishing a separate vo-

cational curriculum for those who are, In
effect, studying for a professional athletic
career. “Universities should recognize peo-
ple who have athletic gifts and establish
appropriate courses of study, practical
courses that will meet the needs of those
students," says Green. Such a curriculum,
as he envisions it, would provide some
basic ﬁnancial-management training as
well as some preparation for life after a pro
career has ended. It would lead to a certiﬁ-
cate of completion, not a bachelor's degree,
so as not to compromise the academic
integrity of the institution. As many as 20
to 30 percent of college athletes might opt
for such a curriculum, Green
estimates. The rest would pur-
sue a normal college educa-
tion, “which, believe it or
not," says Green, “is what
most of us want."

For one reason or another,
many athletes aren't getting it.
The Center for the Study of
Sport in Society at Boston‘s
Northeastern University has
developed an innovative ap-
proach to provide a second
chance forathletes who did not
get an education—and to make
sure future student-athletes
have their priorities straight.
The center‘s University Degree
Completion Program encour-
ages athletes playing for pro
teams in the Boston area to ﬁn-
ish up at Northeastern. During the center's
ﬁrst year of operation, 45 members of the
New England Patriots, Boston
Bruins and Boston Red Sox en-
rolled in special transitional
Northeastern courses to begin
work toward completing their
degrees. The courses were held
at the ofﬁce, as it were—at Sul-
livan Stadium, Boston Garden
and Fenway Park.

The athletes were also at-
tracted by the opportunity to
participate in another of the
center‘s efforts—an outreach
program for junior-high- and
high-school students. Pro ath-
letes spoke, in both large and
small groups. to the awed kids,
counseling them about the pro-
hibitive odds against making it
to the big time. "Many young-
sters, believing they can be the
next Dr. J but not Dr. James,
ignore their studies while pur-
suing the dream ofbecoming a
sports star." says center direc-
tor Richard Lupchick. “The
truth is that the odds are better

says, “that they had not had the help and
guidance they should have had. "

This summer the center announced the

any of its own former athletes who have
attended on scholarship since l975 and
have not graduated. It is an amnesty of sorts
that applies equally to the millionaire pro
and the dropout bus driver. And it is re-
markable in that it acknowledges some un-
ﬁnished business on the part of both the
athlete and the university.

That unﬁnished academic business un-
derlies much of the integrity crisis in col-
lege sports. Potential for abuse can be
limited when athletes are admitted and
educated as students, when responsible
adults place humane values above com-
petitive pressures and when institutions do

generated dollars. It can be done; some
schools still manage to play it straight—
and win. But it seems to be getting harder
all the time.
