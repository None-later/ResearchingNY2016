n campus, Karen Williams looks
0 much like any other student, with

baggy clothes and no makeup. But
unlike most. she rarely gets to go on vaca-
tion or to attend a fraternity party, and
she has never been troubled with weight
problems like the dreaded “freshman 10."
On the other hand, when she
works to pay her college ex-
penses, she can earn up to
$2,500 a day.

Williams, 19, isa top fashion
model—u “Face of the '80s“
ﬁnalist last year—one of hun-
dreds of college students who
pay their tuition through this
glamorous but demanding,
even nerve-racking, job. Some
are famous. like Brooke Shields
and Jennifer Beals, but most
student-models are the boys
and girls in the next seat in his-
toryclass.

While some models are en-
ticed by the glamour and the
travel, primarin they go for the
money. “How many places can
you work two hours a week and
make $250?“ asks Mike Beaty,
head of a Dallas modeling
agency and a former college
model himself. Understand-
ably, some of their classmates
find this annoying. “My friends
tease me all the time," says
Keith Maley, 19, who attends
Brooklyn College. "I work an
hourund makeas much as they
make in a week." Says Boston
College junior Tracy Fitzpat-
rick. 2|, who has modeled for
Ralph Lauren and Wendy's:
“If it weren‘t for modeling, l
wouldn'thavebeenabletogoto
school." Tracy and her twin,
Tara. a sophomore at the State
University ofNew York in l’ur-
chase. often appear together in
Seventeen.

Schoolwork, of course. lim-
its models' time and income.
“I‘m deﬁnitely at a ﬁnancial
loss, but [college is] like an
investment," says Williams.
Womenureparticulnrlytempt-
ed to quit school, since the col-
lege years usually oil‘cr them
their peak modeling opportu~
nities. “I'm 21, and I'm one of
the vets," says Jacki Adams. a \

and under contract to Elizabeth Arden.
Having lost a small fortune in bookings last
year, she is taking some time offfrom NYU
but plans to return. Male models can usual—
ly work longer, and Ken Batt, 22, one oflast
year'sJordache jeans men, warns that “a lot

school have never gone back." Still, he
skipped a semester from St. Joseph's Uni-
versity in Philadelphia to build his port-
folio in Europe, where fashion maga-
zines abound.

New York is the modeling capital of the
world, but work is available in nearly every
city in the country. Models often move to
New York during vacations and do catalogs
in their college towns during the school
year. Each summer in New York, Batt saves
enough to cover tuition at St. Joe‘s and
during the academic year works in Philadel-
phia. For two years Williams commuted
from Brown in Providence,
R.I., to New York. “I know
every single route," she says.
This year should be easier be-
cause she is taking her junior
year at Columbia.

utside New York the
0 work often pays less

and looks less glamor-
ous. Models at H“. Images in
Denver usually earn $75 an
hour posing and not as much
when serving as hosts at con-
ventions, dinner parties and
beneﬁts. But it is easier to break
into the business. “There are
enough girls in New York,"
says Denver model Valerie
Butler, 20, who majors in for-
eign languages and commer-
cial art at Metro State College.
College models, many of whom
are athletes, make up half of
Beaty's Dallas agency. One is
Henry Barnes, a junior major-
ing in interior design and archi<
tectural engineering at North
Texas State. At 22, he usually
earns $100 an hour modeling
for everything from Ebony
magazine to K mart catalogs.
There’s no shortage of business
in Texas: “You have to turn
down bookings all the time,“
Barnes says.

There are, however, trade-
offs. The schedule is unpredict—
able, so most college models
elect to miss classes only ifajob
offers an exotic trip or a lot of
money. “Two hours‘ work in
New York isn‘t worth it if
you're going to miss classes,"
says Batt. But for a job that
meant a week in San Diego, the
international-relations major
got his teachers‘ blessing (he
has a 4.0 grade~point average)
and popped his books in his
suitcase. Agencies push their
star models to work steadily. If
college models ignore bookings
because they're taking ﬁnals,
