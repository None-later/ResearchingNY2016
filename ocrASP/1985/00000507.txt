0n the face of it, photojournalism means just
what it says—photography in the service of jour-
nalism. Most basically, this means news pictures:
the explosion of the dirigible Hindenburg in
1937 or the John F. Kennedy assassination in
1963. But just as journalism is more than break-
ing news, photojournalism is more than action
photography. A feature picture, like a feature
story, can be interesting without being about a
major event: people in the park on the first warm
day of spring. NEWSWEEK ON CAMPUS can-

Center in New York
City maintains a hospice
where terminally ill patients
come to spend their ﬁnal
days. For five months beginning
last September, David Ren-
tas, a photojournalism major at
the Parsons.Sch'ool of De-
sign, took pictures at the hos-
pice for his senior thesis. Part
of his work focused on Murray
Perline, a New York City
printer, who was in and out of
the facility twice during the
last months of his life. Rentas
photographed Perline a
number of times over a four-
month period; Perline died
from prostate cancer last Janu-
ary at the age of 87. "When
he came into the hospice, Mur-
ray was hopping—he would
jump all around and kid," says
Rentas. “At the end, he
couldn't recognize you. It was
painful.“ Despite the emo-
tional strain of working with the
seriously ill, and the under
standable bureaucratic con-
straints taken to protect the
patients, Rentas found taking
pictures at the hospice to be
extremely rewarding: “I like
what they do at the hospice.
That's why I wanted very much
to do this project. They let
