minute: you put down. say, $4,000 against
a $40,000 apartment—the same apart-
ment you would consider renting for, say,
$650 per month. As a renter, it would cost
you (in most cities) two months‘ rent
($1,300), one month as security deposit
($650), and 10 percent of a year’s rent in
brokerage fees ($780), for a grand total of
$2,730 before you even walk in the door.

Now, if you can swing the $4,000
down payment (and, face it, $4,000 isn‘t
that much more than $2,730), you can
probably arrange financing that would
keep your monthly payments at about
$420 (with a 14 percent mortgage). plus
anywhere from $100 to $350 in monthly
maintenance charges (a large portion of
which is deductible). Of course, it’s not as
simple as all this (nothing ever is), but you
get the idea. if you‘re interested in buying
some equity with your living allowance,
opening yourselfupforsubstantiaitax sav-
ings, and making sure your rent money
doesn‘t go out the window (never to be
seen again), talk to your parents, a lawyer,
or a real estate broker about buying an
apartment in the area you're planning to
live.

CASE IN POINT

The idea of moving out of New Orleans
was something Keith Horil, 22, had resigned
himself to before he graduated from Tulane
last May. A computer science major, Horil
realized the high-tech prospects in his home-
town were less promising than in other high
technology centers.

“I lived at home during college, ” Horil
explains, "and on top of all that l was just
ready to go, just to get out of the house. "

He accepted the first job offered to
him—as a telecommunications trouble-
shooter for Northern Telecom in Dallas—
after an internship with Hewlett Packard in
New Orleans did not lead to e promised job
with the Colorado Springs division of the
company. The Northern Telecom offer
came via Tulane's on-campus recruiting
effort.

80 two weeks alter graduation (the
company was anxious for him to start as
soon as possible), Horil hired a moving van
and shuffled off to Dallas. Northern
Telecom put him up in a hotel while he
began his apartment search.

"The first dayl went out and looked on
my own, "‘he remembers, "and / got really
upset when I didn't find anything I liked. "
Discouraged, he turned to a real estate
agent recommended by his flrm’s person-
nel office and his luck, he thought, suddenly
changed.

"The next day the agent showed me
an apartment i really liked. "he says, "and!
just on the spur of the moment said / 'd take
it, which is the wrong thing to do. it’s a little
bit too far from where / work.

 

Special Advertising supplement

“Agents will tell you anything and it ’s a
good idea to check out what they say. [This
agent told him a 40 minute drive to work
would take him no longer than 20 minutes]
Drive the commute yourself. And take your
time; don't take the first thing that looks
good to you, look at a few apartments you
like before choosing. "

Horil ran into another sticky problem
before he finally got settled. “I overextend-
ed myself on my credit card, " he tells. "/ 'd
had a card for some time and was used to
using one, but there are so many things you
need when you go from your parents'
house to your own. You spend a lot.

“i tried to be kind of smart about it; /
had my credit limit raised before / left New
Orleans, but / went way beyond it anyway.
You really should be conservative in your
first few months. until you settle ln. Don 't be
too anxious—that was one of my faults.
Take a little time and think before you do
anything. "
