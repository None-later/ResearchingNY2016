Not Weird—Just Different

With no grades or course credits, Hampshire students help create their own education.

rade-point averages do not exist at
G Hampshire College. for two very

good reasons. First, there are no
grades at Hampshire. And second, the
School doesn't give credits for courses
completed. There also aren’t any freshmen
or sophomores or juniors or seniors. A
student graduates by passing a series of
“examinations,” which really aren't tests
in the blue-book or multiple-choice sense.
If all this sounds confusing and weird.
well, it is and it isn‘t. Hampshire has
students and faculty and courses and
learning, but they combine in a way that
doesn't happen on other college campuses
The school has been described as experi-
mental, alternative and nontraditional. “I
prefer distinctive." says Adele Simmons,
president of the college. “It implies that we
have a clear sense of what we are, that we
are different and that we are going to be
this way for a while."

Hampshire was born unique. Located in
the lovely Connecticut River valley a few
miles south of Amherst. Mass, it was
created by a consortium of four neighbor-
ing schools—Smith, Mt. Holyoke, Am-
herst and the University of Massachusetts.
Back in 1958, even before the “troubles” of
the '60s, they laid plans to meet the "cri-
sis" in higher education by setting up a
new sort of campus where students would
take responsibility for building their own
academic programs and scholars would
break out of their rigid, departmental cub<
byholing. This dream did not start coming
true until 1965, when a wealthy Amherst
alumnus donated $6 million. In 1970—at a
time when student rebellion resounded
around the country—Hampshire accepted
its ﬁrst class. Although the i958 schema
was modiﬁed somewhat, the twin hall-
marks of Hampshire—self-motivated stu-
dents and interdisciplinary curricula—
were still intact. “When we were brand
new, there was a ﬂush of freshness." says
David Smith, codean of the Humanities
and Arts school and one of the ﬁrst
faculty to arrive. “This was a virtually
Utopian place."

Not everybody was quite that thrilled.
Many scholars judged the academic pro-
gram too permissive, and the liberal bent
of the students and faculty reinforced
the widespread belief that “Camp Hump"
was a frivolous. almost completely anor-
chie place. Now. in the age of Reagan,
freewheeling Hampshire has regained its
momentum. School ofﬁcials have crafti-
ly emphasized the opportunities for “en-
