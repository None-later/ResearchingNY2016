The Blue Nile: Unorthodox m usic from on unorthodox Scottish trio

‘I-Iakes From
The Stakes’

No doubt about it—the three
musicians who make up The
Blue Nile are Scottish. Just lis-
ten to lead singer Paul Buchan-
an talk about the shock of visit-
ing New York for the ﬁrst time:
“We‘ve been doin' our hakes
from the stakes [hicks from the
sticks] number," he says in a
thick burr. Hakes or not, Bu-
chanan and bandmates Robert
Bell and Paul Moore have clear-
ly arrived. Their debut album.
“A Walk Across the Rooftops,"
impressed critics when it was
released in Britain last year—
nnd the record seems likely to
do the same now that it‘s been
picked up by an American label.

Buchanan, Bell and Moore
ﬁrst got together as students at
Glasgow University back in
1981. None had much musical
experience. “We just sort of
messed about for a wee while."
says Buchanan. The trio’s inex-
perience. and attendant lack of
preconceptions, may explain
the distinctiveness of its intro-
spective synth-pop sound. As a
singer. Buchanan isn‘t afraid to
push himself to the edge of his
vocal range in order to make an
emotional point; though he
sometimes risks sounding uma-
teurish, he always hits the evoc-
ative note he's after. As arrang-
crs, the three musicians are
imaginative as well as eclectic.
The instrumentation on “A
Walk Across the Rooftops“

simple one-ﬁnger piano and

spare percussion on the slow,
moody title track to a driving
mixture of guitar, bass, synthe-
sizers and strings on the roman-
tic “Tinseltown in the Rain.”
“It‘s like mixing paints,“ says
keyboardist Moore, a former
ﬁne-arts student.

For all their obvious talent,
Buchanan, Bell and Moore are
surprisingly little known—even
back homein the UK. Says Bu'
chanan, “I‘ve had my own al-
bum recommended to me by
someone I knew at school." In
part, their continuing obscurity
is their own fault; unlike most
professional bands, The Blue
Nile had the audacity to record
an album without ever playing
in front of a live audience, and
they have no plans to start tour-
ing in the near future. And it
hasn‘t helped that Linn Prod-
ucts, the British company for
whom they recorded “A Walk
Across the Rooftops" two years
ago, was an electronics ﬁrm
with no record-marketing expe‘
rience. Then. again, obscurity
has its advantages. For one
thing, it has allowed The Blue
Nile to escape the usually ines-
capable pressure to record hits.
“We don't want people to think.
‘That‘s a great bass line' or
'Thnt's really commercial'.“
says Buchanan. The fact is, the
three musicians often don‘t
know where they‘re going with
a song until they get there. “We
work on it," says bassist and
keyboardist Bell, “until we
reach the feeling wc‘ve chosen."
A risky exploration]. perhaps,
but one that paid all.

TV for Yuppies
About Yuppies

Sure, you could say the new
CBS series “Hometown” is
“The Big Chill on the Little
Screen” or “The Return of the
Return of the Secaucus Seven."
After all, with its photogenic
septet of l9605 college churns
who reunite in the 19805, the
show is unquestionably about
and aimed at Yuppies.

Whyshouidn'titbe? Thefact
is, Julie and Dinah Kirgo. the
sisters who created the show,
are themselves young urban
professionals. Their profession
just happens to be television
production. Julie, 34, is mar-
ried; Dinah, 32, is not. Julie
went to Harvard; Dinah didn‘t
attend college. Among other
things, they both worked as sto-
ry editors on “One Day at a
Time," which enjoyed a suc-
cessful run, and as writers on
"Reggie," which did not.

Nearly everyone assumes
that the idea for "Hometown"
was ripped 011' from "The Big
Chill." In fact, it had been kick-
ing around various Kirgo
households since 1978. Back
then the sisters wanted to do a
half-hour sitcom about what J u-
lie describes as “seven charac-
ters who had grown up in the
‘60s and were coping with the
'705.” Now the characters are
