t: ping with the '808, and the
show is an hourlong comedy-
drama. “It‘s about peoplestrug-
gling with the choices that are
there for them and the conﬂicts
that come out ofthose choices,“
says Dinah. Though “Home-
town" occasionally falls back
on an annoying cliché or stereo-
type, it remains essentially
fresh, thanks to an earnest
group of performers (including
Jane Kaczmarek and John Bed-
ford-Lloyd) and a low-key ap-
proach. Perhaps best of all, un-
like “Big Chill" and “Secaucus
Seven," "Hometown" lasts
more than a single weekend.

Keillor: His himtetowrt—Xort of

Lake Wobegon:
Lovely to Visit

lf Lake Wobegon, Minn.,
didn‘t exist (which it doesn‘t),
somebody would have had to
invent it (which. fortunately. he
did). The somebody in question
is Garrison Keillor, humorist
‘t of American Public
superb weekly show,
“A Prairie Home Companion."
Since 1974. when a magazine
assignment on the Grand Ole
Opi‘y rekindled his love for
live radio, Keillor has broad-
cast a sweet-tempered variety
programthatchronicles“thelit-
tle town that time forgot, that
the decades ciuniot improve," a
place where “all the women are
strong. all the men are good-
looking and all the children are
aboveaverage."

  
  
 

It’s worth saying one more
t' Lake Wobegon does not

' except in the imagination
of Keillor and in the hearts of his
listeners. Reading Keillor‘s new
book "Lake Wobegon Days”
(Viking. $17. 95), you may need
to remind yourselfofthis. After
all, his explanation of why the
town doesn‘t appear on any map
is so plausible: two of the four
teams working on the infamous
Coleman Survey of 1866 moved
a little faster than scheduled,
while the other two moved a
little slower—thus creating a
small overlap at the state‘s
center, which the legislature
simply eliminated. In any case,
by ﬂeshing out his weekly radio
monologues, Keillor has cre—
ated a sharp, touching and al-
most believablealbum oflifeina
Midwestern small town. There
areneat portraitsofLake Wobe-
gon regulars: Senator K. Thor-
valdson, the kindly but, some-
what bewildered old gentleman
whose ﬁrst name really is Sena-
tor (his mother thought it
had a nice ring to it); the duck-
hunting brothers ofthe Sons of
Knute lodge who use decoys
14 feet long (which should look
just right, they ﬁgure. to mer-
g' rs ﬂying high overhead);
Wally (Old Hard Hands) Bun-
sen, who was almost the greatest
ballplayer ever, and the narra-
tor,inlurgepartKeillorhimself,
a shy, gangly kid whose family
belongs to an impossibly con-
tentious fund' entalist sect
known as the Sanctiﬁed Breth-
ren: “They broke up at every
opportunity  by the time I
came along, there were dozens
oftiny Brethren groups, none of
which were speaking to any of
theothers.

All this could be mushy going
in the hands of a le .killful
storyteller. Fortunate y, Keil-
lor knows just when to season
the story 'th the kind of hu-
man emotions that aren't neces-
sarily sunny. The people of
Lake Wobegon can sometimes
be unkind. hypocr cal and pet-
ty. but Keillor believes—and
makes us belie that at heart
they are good. it a neat trick:
we see onrselvc. in them, not
just the way we'd like to be. but
the way we probably are most of
the time. This is a hopeful.
heartening book; Lake Wobe-
gon is a lovely place to visit.

Wang in San Francisco: Humor that ’s sen timeuta! but not maudli'n

 



Chinese Food,

Chinese Culture

It‘s not that ﬁlmmaker
Wayne Wang doesn’t like Chi-
nese food, it's just that he has a
limit. Having named his latest
movie "Dim Sum" after the ap-
petizer-style Chinese cuisine, he
has found himself eating count-
less dim-sum lunches while pro-
mating the movie. I‘I love Chi-
nese food,“ Wang says, “and I
need to eat a bowl of rice ev-
ery couple of days. But enough
isenough."

Food is a key element in
Wang's enchanting new ﬁlm.
The Chinese-American family
at the center of “Dim Sum" is
divided between two cultures,
and Chinese food is one of the
few things that unite them. Ger-
aldineTam is an English-speak-
inggradstudentwhoexistscom-
fortably in white America. Her
mother speaks Chinese and

clings to the ways of her native
land. Gliding back and forth
between the two is Geraldine’s
uncle. He admires his niece‘s
adaptability, but he also wor-
ries about the great Chinese
recipes that will be lost when her
mother dies. “No more Duck
Won Tonl” he cries. “No more
Shark‘s Fin Soupl No morel"
Wang’s ﬁrst movie was the
underground hit “Chan Is M iss-
ing," made three years ago on
a minuscule $23,000 budget.
Turning down oﬁ‘ers from major
studios, he opted to make “Dim
Sum" instead, for a somewhat
more comfortable $450,000.
Now a naturalized American
citizen, Wang was born in Hong
Kong 36 years ago and ﬁrst
came to the States to attend
college. His father was a fan
of American movies and in-
troduced Wang to Frank Cap-
ra's ﬁlms, from which the
young director seems to have
learned a lot. Both “Chan ls
iss' g" and “Dim
Sum' manage to be
sentimental, charm-
ing and funny—with-
o t becoming maud-
lin. Sensibility isn’t
the only thing Wang
acquired from Hol-
lywood. Old movies
also provided him
with a ﬁrst name—
choseii by his father
to honor one of the
g old man‘s favorite ac-
tors: John Wayne.
