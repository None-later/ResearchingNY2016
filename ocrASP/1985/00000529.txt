Although the SUNY Board of
Trustees fufilled a long term goal
of student activists when it voted
to divest its stock holdings in cor-
porations that do business ' in
South Africa 'last Tuesday, the
change of policy may have been
supported by some trustees “for
all the wrong reasons." according
to Jane McAlevey, President of

' the Student Association of the

State University (SASU).

Concern about the declining

value of' South African-related
stocks may have played a.vital
role in the final vote. McAievey
Said, rather than objections to the
South , African government’s
policy of apartheid- a strict
separation of races with civil
rights reserved only for whites.
The board voted 9—4 in favor of
divesting the SUNY endowment
fund within the next year, while
reserving the right to rescind the
divestment resolution if positive
changes in South Africa warrant
the revocation. _
“We came to a majority con-
sensus, if not-a unanimous con-
sensus, because there are a great
many opinionslori‘this board in
question," Board 'of Trustees
Chairman Donald M. Blinken
said at the meeting. '

decision to divest, including those

Opponents of the divestment
proposal made their statementsat
the board meeting first, saying

that divestment would not help
blacks gain freedom in South.
Africa. US. economic interests in
the country should instead be us-
ed. as political leverage in
negotiating for their rights. it Was
also stated that the board could
not fully understand the situation
in South Africa and should follow
the anti-divestment recommenda-
tions of the Ford Foundation.

American corporations are'ac-

trustee who voted against divest-

meeting, he said,“My guess is

Karen Wilson search: six months and counting

By Mark Kobrlnsky

September 27 was not marked by any
ceremony-on campus. in fact the day pass-
ed' by much as any other Friday. The dif-
ference was that it‘markcd the six month
anniversary of SUNYA student Karen
Wilson’s disappearance.

Both University and state police are con-
tinuing the investigation and have ruled
out the possibility that Wilson left volun-
tarily. according to Director ‘of Public
Safety James Williams. .

Police have determined, Williams ex-
plained, that Wilson had only $3.34 in
cash with her when she disappeared, and
that she left behind plane tickets for a
planned Spring Break trip to Florida.

Wilson also‘had a major credit card in
her poasession when she disappeared,
Williams said. but the card has not been
used since then.

“To our complete satisfaction. we feel
that Karen did not runaway. She was a
good student. very close with her parents.
roommate and friends. and had no pro-
blems," said Williams.

The investigation is being handled by of-
ﬁcials at the Public Safety Division at
SUNYA and the New York State Police
Bureau of Criminal investigation
(ECU-Troop 0. According to Williams,
“This is still an active investigation. We
can't disclose what we‘re doing now, but it
involves several officers of this department

and members of the New York State
Police."

Public Saftey continues to receive
telephone calls from people claiming they
have seen Wilson. even though the
telephone calls have diminished con-
siderably, Williams said, each logical and
plausible lead is investigated. '

Calls from across the nation have been
reaching the two agencies involved.
“Recently. a call came in. with informa-
tion that Karen was seen working as a
waitress at a truck stop in Harrisburgh.
Pennsylvania. The Department 'acted
quickly. and interviewed the woman.
Although there was an uncanny
resemblance, the lead turned out to be
negative," said Williams.

(CPS) College students. particularly
entering freshmen, are more lonely than
virtually all other social groups except
single parents. alcoholics and some high
school students, according to a resear-
cher at the University of Nebraska~
Lincoln:

“We have been very surprised to learn
that college students are one of the more
lonely groups of people we've surveyed
over the years." said John Woodward,
UNL professor of human development.
who has given his loneliness test to
thousands of people —— including over
400 students ‘— over the past 20 years.

After asking respondents how they
feel and behave in specific social sltua~
tions. Woodward related them on what
he called his “loneliness index."
"ironically. what we have found is that

of all people — rate very high in the
loneliness index. while the elderly ——
who you would expect to feel lonely ——
are the lowest group on the loneliness in-
dex," he reported.

The only lonelier people than entering
freshmen, he said, are alcoholics. single
parents. rural high school students and
female. inner-city high schoolers. “We
believe that students are lonely for it
good many reasons." Woodward ex-
plained. “Most of them have been
uprooted from their family support
systems. their life-long friends. and are
