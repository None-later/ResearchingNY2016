Accessible ' mini-bus needed to

~ By Lisa thzolo

Disabled students who are fac-
ed with the possibility of becom~
ing virtual prisoners on the up-
town campus have formed a task
force to raise money to buy a ban-
dicapped accessible mini-bus.

According to Nancy Belowich.
Director of Disabled Student Af-
fairs. the current mini-bus was
purchased in l977/but has not
been in working dondition since
September of this .year. The
estimated cost of the new van is
$20,000. 

The task force is composed of
volunteer students and faculty
members. Letters were sent by
Belowich, Robert Pipia, Universi-
ty Action for the Disabled (UAD)
President. and lwrin Weinstein.
Student Community Committee
co-chair. to people who are active
in SUNY affairs. About 36 people
are currently members of the task
force. but anyone is welcome to

join and Pipia said he expects
more people to sign up.

The task force will raise money
through various fund raising ac-
tivities. Donations will be
solicited from Alumni. parents of
disabled students attending the
university, and local sponsors.

A common question, Belowich
said. is; why the university is not

buying the new van. The universi-‘ .

ty spends money for handicapped
students on a regular basis and it
is not economically possible to
meet every need. said Beiowich.
adding that . UAD wants to
demonstrate that they are able to
help themselves. -

“Wears; proud that they (the
university)'do so much for us
already. They’ll do as much as
they can toIheIlp us pay for the
new van." said Belowich.

The van. Pipia said. “serves the
same purpose for us as the off
campus bus does for non-disabled

r mobilizefhandicapped students

students. The disabled studsents
have a great need to go to the
malls. Stuyvesant Plaza. the train
station, or the hospital
everyday.” ' I

The van “represents equality.
opportunity. and independence
for the handicapped." added
B'elowich. “SI.  - j .v .'

task force members will_;work

Africa and urge SUNY to divest;
It was “the biggest demonstra-
tion on campus in the last eight
years." said Student Assocation
President Steve G'awley.

The rally, sponsored by SA’s
Minority Affairs Office and the
Student Association of the State
University (SASU). .was part of
South African v-Awareness Day'
and occurred the night before the
SUNY Board Iof Trustees voted to
divest its. endowment fund of
companies which do' business in
South Africa.

Minority Affairs Chair Paco
Duarte said he felt the rally was
an example of student effec-
tiveness. “ I think that students
played a major role in the deci-
sion (to divest)- not only because
of the rally. but because they have
been working at it for ten years
and because two weeks prior to
the event three students served '
time in jail,” said Duarte.

American companies who do
blisiness with South. Africa.
Duane said that they are suppor-
ting “a policy of oppression" and
are “making a profit at the ex-
pense of lives.” ‘

the group was established in 1912
to“pursue the struggle in South
Africa through non-violent
