marketing instead of just learning
about it can do so through the
SUNYA chapter of the American
Marketing Association (AMA).

AMA is a nationwide organiza-
tion with Over 300‘chapters in col-
leges and universities across‘the
country. The SUNYA chapter
was started three years ago by
marketing professor William
Danko. the groupfs advisor who
was approached by students in-
terested in getting hands on ex-
perience in marketing._ Interest
has greatly increased, and there
are now over 100 members active
in the organization.

AMA is SA recognized. but not.
funded.

The organization gives its

.members the chance to get ex-

perience in marketing and related
topics said President Dave Jakob.
Right now there are about eight
projects under way, each headed
by a project coordinatror, allow-
ing members a chance to do
marketing for companies and in-
dividuals, he said.

For example, he said, in their '
Bi-Annual Market Trends
Survey, members study Albany _
businesses, how attitudes change
in the public, how changes in
business affect consumers. He ex-
plained that they then get in touch
With companies with their ﬁn-
dings. "It is “valid marketing '
research," said Jakobs.

In another project, said -»
Danko, an independent client
