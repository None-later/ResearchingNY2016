events, or understanding the disciplines of the '

Music event planned

The SUNYA Music Council. an SA funded stu-
dent group, will be presenting a young artists con-
cert series. According to group secretary Stacy
Kern. the first such event will take place on
November 6 in the Performing Arts Center.

“The ﬁrst will be Gary Schocker.” explained
Kern. “who is a flutist from New York City."

“Gary is the winner of a competition. the prize of
which is. international recitals. He has performed
already with the Philadelphia Philharmonic.”

Said Kern. the Music Council will feature several
events this year, including noontime concerts. a
music marathon concert, and other events.

1 Water policy altered

An extensive midday demand for water at the
Rathskellar snack bar has necessitated a change in
water policy. At certain times of the day. water will
no longer be sold.

According to snack bar manager Rod Wojnar.
“so many students were requesting water that it
became unfair for students waiting for sodas."

“The problem is that the water is at room
temperature. and we were using twice as much ice
for the water as opposed to the sodas. We were run-
ning short of ice by 12 noon."

Wojnar said that the water policy applies to busy
daytime hours only. The policy went into effect last
week.

School spirit rallied

A pep rally was held last Friday, September 20 at
the small fountain in front of the Campus Center.

According to Jaclyn Bernstein, President of the
Class of 1987. around 300 people clad in Albany
paraphernalia attended the rally. She said that most
of the fall sports were represented.

The program included an introduction of the
players and a show by the cheerleaders and kick
line. Balloons and fall sports schedules were given
out.

The rally's success was evident when 2100 fans at—
tended the football game at Heritage Park against
R.P.I. on Saturday.

Gloria causes damage

Hurricane Gloria did not cause any major pro-
blems on campus according to Dennis Stevens.
Assistant Vice President for Facilities.

Stevens said that minor damage occurred on cot-
onial Quad when the wind caused insulation to
blow off of a roof.

According to Stevens some short-circuits occur~
red in underground power lines that supply power
to the lights near Alumni House. “We were suc-
cessful in rerouting the line so we didn’t lose
power.” he said.

The only other damage reported on campus was
some minor leaking.

SUNYA sees the light.

Many of the light fixtures on campus and in the
student ghetto have recently been upgraded or will
be upgraded in the next year. ‘

According to Dennis Stevens." Assistant'IVice'

President for Facilities. the exterior lights on Alum-
ni Quad have been converted to high pressure
sodium. The project was finished last week.

On the uptown campus the lights on perimieter .

road will be converted to high pressure sodium. The
contract was rewarded to LaCoste Electrical Con-
struction and Maintenance for a bid of 324.346.

Additional relamping and updating of lighting is
scheduled to occur on the podium. quads, and
walkways uptown during the fall and spring. accor-
ding to Stevens.

Over the summer Niagra-Mohawk and the City

of Albany installed new lighting in the Pine Hills
area. “We were instrumental in having these lights
installed." said Stevens. He explained that the
University helped to'identify areas in need of
lighting.

'walked

By Karen E. Beck

STAFF WRITER

SUNYA student Gary Palmer
into Dutch Quad
Flagroom last Wednesday expec~
ting some answers from Universi-

.ty President Vincent O'Leary

about how much money had been

I appropriated to upgrade the

university’s computers last

summer.

Palmer_ said he left the
flagroom feeling “reassured that
the problem was being worked on
in such detailwhen I was under
the impression thatlittleatteution
was being given to it.”

Palmer attended the first of
“Conversations with the Presi-
dent," a serit : of informal ques-
tion and answer sessions with
O'Leary. Students ' were
nominated to attend the forum by
their Residence Directors.
“Tonight has been a valuable
opportunity for me to speak
directly with students." com~
mented O’Leary. “it has always
been important to me to deal with
students directly."

Frank Pogue. Vice President
for Student Affairs said he felt
“that things went well. The ques-
tions were those I had expected:
alcohol. South Africa. and in-
creased occupancy." _ .

The 21 year old drinking age
was an issue which students
discussed amongst themselves as
well as. with administrators at the
forum. O'Leary. Pogue and John

, Martone. Director of Residential

Life. contributed useful insight to

students anticipations about
changes that will come after
December 1.

Martone explained in detail
about such changes. explaining
changes for non-alcoholic pro-

cases of alcohol abuse. "We will
be educating students about the
impact and abuse of alcohol while
enforcing a law." as well.

In addition to the 21 drinking
age, Martone also fielded ques-
tions about . mandatory meal
plans. increased occupancy and
the reservation of space for
freshmen on all of the quads.

“OILcary had a hold on things
and he was good at taking a stand
on certain issues.“ said Palmer.
“He referred specific issues to the
appropriate administrator." he
a .

In response to a question about
student aid and the possibilities of

financial cutbacks, O’Leary urg-
ed students to communicate with
Congressional members. “This
can be a student’s most powerful
tool. It really works." he said.

. Apartheid and SUNY Central‘s
recent financial divestment from
South Africa were also discussed
,in detail. O'Leary commented
that theyrolc of students in the
decision to divest “did have some
impact.” but that “many other
factors were involved."

“I think we need to-learn how
to deal with the role of students in
any involvement in issues." said
Pogue. “They can and do raise
serious questions about equality
and justice." he added.

About 20 students were invited
to hear and f participate in

“Conversations with .-the Presi--

dent." I think I'd like to see more
students attend. but too many
would make it impossible to hen;
die." said Pogue. “Much of
education is in being able to see
education take place.” he said.
“It's important for the president
to hear students and speak direct-
ly with them." Pogue added. V

Pogue lhimself raised, some
questions and points. about
academic dishonesty.- Students
wereeager to comment on the
subject and relate past ex-
periences with classroom cheating
to the administrators. “Students
have becon concerned about what
goes on in the classrooms in terms
of cheating. We now have to
decide how we can work to reduce
cheating.

Wednesday’s forum was the
first of several “Conversations
with the President" scheduled for
this semester.

“Students did a very good job
of asking significant questions.
and raising significant issues."
said Martcne.

“It was an interesting oppor-
tunity to see how he’d react to my
problem.“ said Palmer. The
whole idea of "Conversations"
was great." he said. adding “I
only wish that the administrators
had presented themselves a little
less formally."

The President will meet with
students again on Monday. 0c-
tober 7 in the Campus Center
Assembly Hall from 11 cm. to
noon. Ofﬁcers from the Off-
Campus Association will be pre-
sent. D
