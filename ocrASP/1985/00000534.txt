On September 26 the “Implementation
of 21 " committee held a meeting to discuss
the course of action they will be taking.
“The heart of the discussion," said phil
Botwinick, a Central Council Represen-
tative and committee member, “is still the
intent of the law.”

Botwinick explained that the committee
members see the law as having different in-
tents. “As a student, I see it as a way to cut
out high school drinking, however. not
everyone feelsw this way," he said. Bot-
winick added that some committee
members feel that certain policies such as a
possible “dry campus” will make students
who have alcohol problems more
recognizable and treatable.

“No specific motions
or proposals were
voted on yet.”

The committee is planning to hold a
hearing so that students can voive their
opinions. “The main focus of our meeting
.(on September 26) was to put ﬁnishing
touches on the open student meeting we
are planning," said James Doellefeld,
Director of Campus Lile and chair of the
implementation committee.

“The masin concern of students is not to
have the campus turned into a police area.

“We are planniong to take an advertise-

and the Student Voice.” Doellefeld said.

students as well, he added.

Perkins and Alan Berkowitz. an assis-
tant professor of psychology at both
colleges, recently completed a ﬁve-year
study of drinking patterns on the cam-
pus. The two professors said they
surveyed drinking habits of students on

Christopher D. Smithers Foundation.

The purpose of the study. Perkins
said. was to discover whether changing
social patterns were actually affecting
the drinking habits of women. When the
first survey was taken in 1979. campus
women drank an average of about two
times a week, Perkins said. In the 1984
survey. campus women were drinking
an average of three times a week, he
said. The men were drinking about the
same amount over the ﬁve year period,
about three to four times a week.

However, Perkins said. women
students are still consuming less alcohol
than males do. Women have an average
of four drinks at a party. for example,
while men have an average of six drinks,
he said.

“In the past she’d be less likely to go
out and have a drink with the guy."
Perkins said, “but when she gets there.
she’s still not likely to be drinking as

people drank, how often they drank.
and how often they got .into social.

drinking.

The study found that about 20 per-
cent of the men were heavy drinkers,
while only four percent of the wome
were in that category. - _ , . -

students at the colleges abstained from
alcohol. a result consistent with other
studies of campuses in the Northeast,
Perkins said.

The first two surveys in the study, in
1979 and 1982. were taken when the
state’s legal drinking age was 18. The
1984 survey was taken after the legal
drinking age was raised to 19, Perkins
said.

The state drinking age will rise to 21
on December 1. Perkins said he did not
think that will affect the amount of
alcohol consumedon campus, becaii '
