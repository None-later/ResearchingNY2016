ten psychologists chosen from aoss th
United States and Canada ‘ testiny
September ll before a commission which
may propose national legislation aimed at
reducing pornography in the United
States.

The committee, called the Attorney
General’s Commission on Pornography
was formed by US. Attorney General Ed-
win Meese to find out how pornography
affects criminal behavior and to suggest
legislation dealing with the problem, ac-
cording to Psychology Department chair
Donald Byrne, one of the attendees from
SUNYA. The hearing was held in
Houston, Texas.

Byrne explained that the hearing was
one of six scheduled to take place. “The
hearings will be held in different cities in
the U.S. and will cover different aspects of
pornography," he said.

Nine psychologists from the United
States and one from Canada were chosen.
explained Byrne. “Among the
psychologists picked you could hear a wide
range of opinions and conclusions,“ he
said. Byrne added that they were con-
tradicting opinions represented.

The main focus was to find out what an-
tisocial effects of pornography are. Byrne
said. “However, I went into the prosocial
effects as well. Things such as sex educa-
tion and sex therapy can improve
behavior,” he said.

According to Byrne. one thing that
' became very apparent at the hearing is how
much individuals differ in their responses
to pornography. "Some kind of content
for certain kinds of people can have cer-
tain effects," he explained.

The hearing also pointed out the differ-
ing opinions among pornography experts

Two profs from SUNYA were among ten chosen to testify

psychologists see its effects in different
ways," he said.

One psychologist at the convention
testiﬁed that pornography has a positive

"effect on society. 'Byrne said, “Richard

Green. from SUNY-Stony Brook, discuss-
ed his feeling that pornography is good for
people, even for sexcriminals. " According
to Byrne, Green reasoned that if there

wasn’t pornography, there would be in-
creased occurences of rape and child
molesting.

The opinion that pornography has a
negative effect on society also was express-
ed at the hearing. “Another professor has
done research to show that exposure to
pornography in large doses has a very
negative effect on social behavior," Byrne
said.

 

This study, showed that ' dfe n V '
attitudes toward wiihien'werE"‘shoc\5:t:;
posure to poriibg'iiiﬁhy. ‘T‘Both men and
women thought‘WapeWI‘aEa less «serious
crime” after viewing ‘ pornographic
materials, Byrne added.- ' I

According to the other attendee from
SUNYA, Kathryn Kelley, one problem
with the meet current research is that “the
studies always involve college students in a
lab situation. It is hard to drag people off
the street." Kelley is an associate professor
of psychology at the University.

The hearing met with the intent of pass-
inglegislation, Byrne said. “We' are trying
to question previous Work and the exact ef-
fects to decide "whether legislation is a
necessity.” Byrne said. V

The idea of legislation isa complor one.

added Byrne. "If you assume that there‘

should be legislation it is still difficult

because you can’t just talk about'sex but,

the content of it." .
Byrne further explained that individuals

_ differ on how they respond to sexual ag-

gression. “You cannot makes law that is
just for certain people," he' said. .,
Byrne 'and Kelley were chosen forthis
hearing on the basis of research and work
they have done. “It was a narrowing down
process. and the names that were most fre-
quently recommended by top people-in the
ﬁeld, were chosen," Byrne said. ' El
