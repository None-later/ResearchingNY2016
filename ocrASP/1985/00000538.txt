Newriding ciUb doing more,

thansimpiy horsin g around

By Olivia Abel

Following a growing equestrian trend ‘

among area colleges, SUNYA has
established its first Riding Club. which will
compete Inlercollcgiatcly in a Northeastern
league. ' -
Members of the new club are very op-
timistic about its success, according to
Audrey McCaughin. the Riding Club’s
founder. who'als‘o helped to establish

' similar organizations at Union College in

Schnectady, Siena College in Loudenville,
and Marist College in Pou’ghkeepsie.

“The clubs at Union and Siena have
taken off very well and there seems to bc a
lot of enthusiam here.” said McCaughin.

According to .McCaughin, the Riding
Club. will hopefully compete in a Nor-
theastern league. whose‘ members include
Skidmore College and ' St. Lawrence
College. . r '

The season will kick off October I9 at
Humber Collr;ge_in Toronto.

More experienced members of the club
will participate on the intercollegiate team.
although the club is open to everyone. ac-
cording to a flycr-handed out at the club's
interest meeting last Thursday. which over
45 people attended. ' g

The Riding Club will operate out of
Ballbay Farm in Altamont. Students can
sign up for onchqur lessons once a week

or once every'two,'wecks.; 3 ‘~ . .
. Each. lesson-will cost [810, according to
McCaughiny- which 7is ‘a-ylisc'oum .for club
members. The farm nominally-charges the
public szo‘fro: alone hour result.”
'A B allbayrFarm will arrange for transpor-
tation to and from the stable for all thosc‘
in the club...but. they are. encouraging
students to set up their own carpools if
possible. McCaughin is ra'f‘ full-time

starting her-Master's degree atgthc time."

Shane added that, “even. motivated
sophomores apply to our programs. it all
depends on the individuals maturity and
his/her academic program.

Students. Passonno said. should “try to
slay the entire year and get used to the
culture." Forthosc ‘who are unsure, more
than half of the programs offered leave it
to the participanlon whether or not to stay
for either a” semester or a full year.

Stephen-Kelley, a senior French major.
applied to stay with a family in Grenoble
for only a semester. Once he was in the
program, he turned his semester into a
year. ' .

“My sense is that in April a few of the
trustees, “who were probably leaning
towards dIvestment just for the sake of
unity- which is how the board-operates a
lot- just kind of let it go by." McAlevcy
said. “The bottom line Is we changed their
vote and we affected change." she added.

SASU used a Business Week cover story
concerning the declining value of stocks
linked to' South Africa In its efforts.
Copies ‘of the article. MoAlevey said. were
distributed to all the'truslees.“Jusl from a
timid standpoint. they were making a poor
Investment. because the effects of the
divestment movement right now on big
corporations that are in South Attica Is
that the yield on their stock ha: been

declining since April.” McAlcvoysald.

McCaughin said her responsibilities with
the club will be twolfold. “Number one.
I’ll be a coach, but l’m‘also the team coor-
dinator. l'm going to working through the

gracident as an adviser to the club.

“basically the sameas Albany tuition —
minus the air rmx.’ You must register on
your home campus and'all' ﬁnancial aid
like Regents scholarships are applicable.

,Givlrcvich added that in her program the
cost “was not a negative aspect because
they supplied you with your original funds
. as a 'comfortablepllowance."

The meetings are open to all and provide
a chance for interested students to ques-
tion former participants who ‘freally want
to talk to new students," said Passonno.

All the students said they would
definitely go again. For a new student
thinking of travelling abroad. “just be
ppm-minded and be willing to accept dif-
ferent things," said Kelley. [I

“i think that there were definitely some
trustees who were completely inﬂuenced
by the fiscal argument." she said.“l felt
that it was so critical at this point that any
kind of argument at all that would help put
those trustees over was worth
introducing."

The distribution of the Business Week
article had no effect on the trustees' deci-
sion. Wales said. “i think that cvcryone's
mind was made up; regardless. Anyonc’s
articles would have done no good." he
said.

The resolution to divest calls for on Im-
mcrliutc moratorium on n variety of in-
vestments in South Africa and gives the ln-
vestmcnt Committee one year In which to
sell SUNY's holdings In South African
assets. “I think that was the fastest we
could possibly hope for," she said, noting
