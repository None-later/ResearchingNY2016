at every truck stop and military base across
the nation," said Williams.

The last report of Wilson’s appearance
in the Albany area was on March 27, 1985
at 8:30 pm. She was last seen on the nor-
thwest corner between Washington
Avenue and Fuller Road, according to
Williams. This report was given by a
“credible” citizen who didn’t know her
personally, he added.

On March 27 at 6:00 pm. Wilson was
reported to have purchased some shirts at
Colonie Center, and paid by check. said
Williams. Wilson had an appointment at
an Albany Tanning Hut at 7:00 pm. and
“We are reasonably sure that she showed
up," said Williams.

Wilson reportedly left the Tanning Hut
around 7:20 pm. "We think she walked
from the Tanning Hut to Washington
avenue.‘ Five or six people think they saw
her walking south on Fuller Road to the
campus. From there she seems ‘to have
walked off the face of the earth’," said
Williams.

The investigation began on March 28
with the efforts of four detectives from the
Public Safety Division and about 50 from
the BCI. “There were so many people to
interview, and not enough men from our
department to do it alone. We needed a lit-
tle assistance. Due to the Spring Recess,
friends of Wilson were called up, and some
were interviewed by Florida police," said

Williams. “There is no need for such a
large detail now, however, if such was
needed, it could be done again ‘— in under
two hours,” he added.

ThepUniversity Police Deparment inter-
viewed 35 customers who were at the Tan-
ning Hut on March 27. A few remember
seeing someone resembling Wilson.
However, the witnesses did not know her
personally, which reduced the number of
leads. ‘,
Wilson’s parents have been active in the
search for their daughter. Jennie Wilson,
Karen's mother. said that “because Karen
is of legal age, it is hard to ﬁnd an agency
that will accept this case." ' _

However. Mrs. Wilson added, three
agencies did accept the case. The agencies
are: Child Seekers, located in Vermont,
Services for the Mlssing,.located-.'ln'New
Jersey, and Family and Friends of Violent
Crime Victims, located in Seattle,
Washington. ' ‘V ' ‘

According to Mrs. Wilson, in June the
Plattsburgh Air Baseiheld’a fund, raising
weekend in Karen’s, honor ‘called ‘The
Karen Wilson Weekend’. “Over the

'weekend there :was a‘walkathon, rides-'_for

children, and an auction. There was an

awareness program for parents to inform

them of the dangers of abduction," said
Mrs. Wilson. “We raised $6,500 for the
reward fund and expenses.” 'she added.

“People come over to our home, and

ask for posters when going on vacation.
