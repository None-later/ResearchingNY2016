The hockey program at Albany State
took a giantstride last week toward its
ultimate goal of ‘ becoming financially
recoghized‘by the, athletic department.

Sparked'j by the persistence of team-V
president‘Paul E'ssner and Head-coach
Bruce Pomako'y. the Albany State hockey
team was granted“ acceptance into the
Eastern Division of the Inercollegiate
Hockey League (lCHL). " l" ' '

The D'anes' schedule will thus include
Division III opponents such as Cortland.
Binghamton,‘ and Broome. Community
College. Fomakoy and Essner are also try-
ing to schedule games against two Western
Divsion opponents, St. Bonaventure and
Buffalo State, but those plans are still in
the works ‘_ ‘ - _ . . ‘

“Technically, we are a clubbecause our
orin funding comes from SA. (Student
Association)," said Pomakoy,’ who took
over thelreigns in January...‘fBut .we think
of ourselves as Divsioh Ill. because we will
now be playing Divison. ill teams.”

The hockey team had' no help from ‘the
athletic department in attaining admission
into the league. in fact, Athletic Director
Dr. WilliamlMoore was unaware of the
club’s acceptance; “They are a very en-
thusiastic bunch," said Dr.’ Moore. “1'
would be willing to sit down and talk to
them.” ‘ ' ’ '

it was Essner__who-~was the most am-
bitious. in June, he was on the phone with '
the'president of the Mohawk Valley Com-
munity College hockey team trying to ar-
range a game forthis season.

“He told me that they couldn’t ﬁt our
team on the schedule because they.just.got ‘
accepted‘into theilCHL." recalledEssrier.
“i ﬁgured if they got in, we could also.”

After numerous’ phone calls to Ralph
Galonte. the League Commissioner,
Essner and Pemakoy.were invited-to the .:

I measure of doubt. “it is difﬁcult for a

annUal league meeting September 21 at the
Ramada Inn in Buffalo. “We made a
speech and did ‘a'y‘so‘ng and dance," said.
Pomakoy. “Asitturned out weVWerc more
organized than some of the other teams."
While Dr. Moore said, that he'would be.
willing to discuss the possibility of athletic
funding, he added that the the club would
have to follow the normal procedures.
whichfcan take up to three years. ‘ "g ,
“We want to talk to' Dr. 'Moore .to_
discuss some . kind of timetable,” ‘said
Pomakoy. “Wewould love to work out of
the athletic building.” ‘ ~ -
While Moore said he would be open to
discuss the matter. he also expressed a

team to operate without a facility,” said
Dr. Moore. “it’s not insurmountable,
though." , . _

two years. But it appears that the Danes
have also improved with. the competition.
“Honestly,-the strength of the competition
is not a problem". said Pomakoy.
"They're very competitive but'So are we.
We have some pretty good looking
freshmen.”. ' .

tices a week for conditioning purposes.
