Perhaps there is no better feeling than to
win, when winning is unexpected. in all of
sports competition the thrill of being the
underdog, yet coming out successful has
proved to capture more excitement and
emotion than winning expectantiy.

The Albany netmen have been experien-
cing this'in the past week with successful
tennis play in both the Great Dane Classic
and the ECAC tournament. not to men-
tion a victory over stego wedged
inbetween.

The Great Dane Classic, an elimination
type tournament hosted by Albany. When
the final set had been played. Albany had
placed an impressive fourth, out of 16.
teams from Divisions i, ii, and ill. Con~
cot'dia College. from Bronxvilie, N.Y..
took first place, last year's defending
champions. Rochester came in second and
the University of Vermont came in third
just ahead of Albany.

,“We did even better than i expected.
against the tough teams we faced. and the
team as a whole played well." said Head
Coach Bob Lewis.

Junior Dave Zobler. number four
singles player for the netmen this year who
made it to the quarterfinals of the Classic
until facing a tough loss to Vermont by a
score of 6-3. 6-3. said. “The team looked
sharp. and l'm sure that as the season goes
on we will improve . . . especially in our
doubles play."

Zobler's defeat came from the number
one seeded player in the tournament who
went on to lose in the semi-finals to Army.

A victory over Oswego. a league team.

came to the Great Danes last week. thus
boosting the season winning record to ﬁve
wins and one loss, the only loss coming
from Army in the opener. Albany defeated
Oswego SVz-3V2. The half point came
because the last point of the number two
doubles match was split.

Perhaps the biggest victory this week
came to freshman Bob} Siracuse and
sophomore Ben Gibson. These days, when
youth seems to ﬂourish in tennis. this
doubles team epitomized that winning
standard.

The ECAC tournament, which includes
Division ii and ill tennis teams. hosted by
the Danes was held indoors in Aibany due
to the outskirting storms of hurricane
Gloria.

And that's just how this doubles team of
Siraeuse and Gibson took their matches:
like a hurricane, wreaking havov on their
opponents. in the semi-final play the team
upset the number one seed University of
Vermont duo. 7-5. 7-5. The team then
moved on to finals action and continued
playing well. but finally lost in close inat-
ches 6-3, 6-4 to Miliersville University of
Pennsylvania. who went on to win the
tournament.

On the whole, Albany came in third
place out of 27 teams finishing behind
Mlllersvllle and Vermont.

“i knew we could do well because we‘d
been playing good together against other
teams this season." said Slracute. “We
were needed third before the tournament.
and we went in positively, played loose and
came up with some good victories." 2 F
