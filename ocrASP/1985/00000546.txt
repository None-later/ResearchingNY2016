Consider r
these points:

- The CDX H
is a metal  'P -' l »

 

This metal particle produces the
highest magnetic moment of any tape
we tested. Nearl twice as high as any
conventional  bias tape—even

higher t an pure metal, until
now the industry champ (see
Graph IH). To you, that trans-
lates into more head room.
‘ch means you can accur-
ately reproduce even the most
sudden bursts of high energy

tape that can CDX”. Wording matches sound that comes with the

be recorded
and played at . - ~
the high bias setting.  -~ 

- The CDX H comes extre" ely close to
matching (see Graph 1) the capability of
today’s most challenging sound source
—the Com act Disc.

- The CD)? H outperforms leading high
bias tapes hands down. Fact is, we
corn ared (see Graph H) the CDX H to
TD SA~X and Maxell XLH-S. The re-
sult? When it comes to hi h energy re-
cording, no one can matc our levels.
That's right. No one.

A bona fide breakthrough in metal
chemistry. The development of a super
alloy. One which lets us turn iron, the
most magnetic material there is, into a
super-small particle only 12 millionths of
an inch long.

So, we spent two years desi ting our
new five-screw cassette from t e ground

assures t at the CDX 1 works as great
as it sounds. In fact, we guarantee it
for life.

The Memorex CDX H can record criti-

better than the best conventional high

duce music without saturating at a 3-5
dB higher input level (see Graph IV).

Now you can record at higher levels
to minimize hiss, and still capture the
loud passages, the peaks, the crescen-
dos—without distortion or loss of high
notes. In fact, you can almost capture
