isolated ripples ol‘ dissent. barely
noticeable over the past few years,
quickly built into a wave of protest
that crashed noisily on tlte public
consciousness in 198’s. There were

protests and demonstrations on
more than 100 university and college
catnpttses in virtttally every region of
the country.

Many thottgltt student activism
was buried forever under mounds of
designer clothes and heaps of hype
about the virtues of Yuppiedom.
However. it has resurfaced with

fall far short of those of the Sixties.
But others point ottt that the activism
seems to be growing at a much

The real question is whether the
campus protest movement will
grow, fade or take a new direction
this academic year.

come to believe what everyone else
said about students being apathetic.
We were wrong.“

llls news editor, Diana Elliot, has a
similar perspective. "1 don't know
why. bill this is the ﬁrst year there
have been really large protests. Stu‘
dents i know are now more aware ol~
politics and issues than just a year or
two before," she says.

While the large campuses on the

't and West Coasts, like Columbia,
Harvard. Rutgers. Cornell. Berkeley
and UCLA have captured much ol‘the
news coverage of the resurgent stu-
dent movement. the activism has
spread nationwide.

Protests. rallies and sit-ins were
held this year in areas like Wyoming
and Nebraska. on campuses where
protest groups like Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS) could
hardly organize a chapter in the late
Sixties, let alone stage a demonstra~
tion.

in more conscrvativ ~ areas of the
country, student activism. while
growing in presence, is still viewed
with skepticism. "Liberals are still
seen by many as far-out. weird.
bearded oafs.“ says Ellen Williams of
the University of Texas Daily ’l'exrm.

Nevertheless rallies at the Austin
campus organized by the Black Stir
dent Alliance attracted over 500 peo-
ple last spring. in March. 2.000 lini-
versity of Texas students paraded to
the state capitol to protest increased
tuition lees.

the other campuses that got involved
this year in anti-apartheid demon
strations.

Karey Murakami. who has report-
ed on student protests for The .‘llt’clti-
gm: Daily at Amt Arbor. speculates
that students have been moved to ac-
tion over a long list ol‘grievances.

“Most students got pretty tired of
hearing how conservative they had
become. This created a backlash."
said Murakami. adding, "World
events have been quite a catalyst to
action. The police violence in South
Africa. the CIA mining the Nicara-
guan harbors . . . these things didn‘t
go unnoticed by students."

At UCLA. where hundreds of stu-
dents camped out on campus for
weeks in a makeshift ‘Mandela City‘
(named for South African political
prisoner Nelson Mandela). Sociolo-
gy Professor Maurice Zeitlin sug~
gests that today‘s protests are taking
place because the South Africa issue
was tailor-made for sparking the new
rebellion. “This issue invites an ab-
solute moral choice. and that's cru-
cial in ottr culture." he explains.
"You need an issue that involves stu-

dent self-interest. but not only that.
You also need moral outrage."

"The large. highly visible move-
ment you see now is not a rebirth."

lumbia protest and now a staffer at
the American Committee on Africa
(ACOA). "it was always there. at
least in root form.“

Williams at the Daily Texan claims

that the November Presidential elec-
tion got students thinking about po
litical issues. "The University Repub~
licans were able to sign tip about 800
people. and the Young Democrats
pulled together just as many"

The big qttestion now facing stu~
dent activists is whether or not they
will be able to sustain their move-
tnent. One presumably ne ‘ ry in-
gredient for success is the ability to
win victories.

On this score the activists can
claim some progress. They take
credit for helping to pressure Con-
gress to moderate White House poli~
cy on Central America. and making
the arms race and nuclear policy sub-
jects of acceptable living room dis
cttssion in Middle America.

A more tangible result is the grow
ing list ol‘universiti s and municipal
and state governments that are with
drawing investment funds t'rom
South Africa.

Yet doubt remains regarding the
future ol'the movement. Mcli-tridge.
for one, isn't making any bets. “lly
