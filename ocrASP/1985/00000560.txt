Wristbands may keep bars open after  

By David Kase
STAFF WRITER

Students who will be affected
.by the 21 year old drinking age
may still be able to socialize at
local bars through the use of
wristbands or hand stamps. Stu-
dent Action Committee Chair
Larry Hartman said at Wednes-
day’s Central Council meeting.

According to Hartman.
Washington‘s Tavern (WT's) on
Western‘ Avenue has already
agreed to implement this policy.

Other social alternatives are
also being investigated in order to
provide students with activities
after the 21-year-old drinking age
goes into effect on December l.

“Wristbands or handstamps
are used in bars in other states to
differentiate those people of
age." said Hartman.

Students often go to the bars
just to socialize and they should
be able to do so. and perhaps

have a soda instead." he added.

This policy will "prevent some
bars from having to close up as a
result of reduced clientele." Hart-
man noted.

According to the Enforcement
Bureau of the Alcoholic Beverage
Control Board. the plan is legal.
said Hartman.

“Hot Box" Ready

Academic Affairs Chair
Michelle Legendre announced
that an academic Hot Box has
been placed in the Student
Associaion (SA) office next to the
front desk.

“it is for people who have com-
plaints about professors, ad-
ministrators, faculty, academic
policy or programs.” explained
Legendre.

“if you have a complaint. just
fill out the form. place it in the
box and it will be investigated “by
the Academic Affairs Commit—
tee,” said Legendre. She added

that all complaints will be kept
conﬁdential.

Legendre is also in charge of
the SA Test Bank. which current-
ly has 106 tests on ﬁle, she said.

“The test bank needs to be ex-
panded and receive more publici-
ty so that everybody knows about
it," Legendre said.

“A limited time offer will be in
effect. Students who bring in old
tests will recieve the same number
of others printed test pages for
free and get back your old test
also," said Legendre.

The list of exams on file will be
distributed to all Resident
Assistants (RA's) and posters will
be put up on campus. said
Legendre.

Van Campaign

in other Council business. the
Student Community Committee
is raising money for a new van for
the disabled.

Central Council Chair Bill Me-

Cann said. “The disabled van is
not in running condition. in light
of the increased awareness of pro-

blems and difficulties facing the..

disabled students.the need for a
new van was brought to our
attention."

The task force was. set up by
‘University Action for the Disabl-
ed (UAD) to raise money for the
handicapped vehicle. Presently,
the task force is in the process of
raising money and the chances of
getting a new vehicle before the
end of the semester are extremely
likely, explained McCann.
_ Student Community Commit-
tee Co-Chair Lynn Livanos is en-
thusiastic about the van project.
“We look forward to working
closely with the administration
and the University Community to
reach our goal," said Livanos.
“Anybody interested in helping
should come down to our weekly
meetings Thursdays at 8 p.m. in

has to be done and they, will live
with it and try to work with it."

“The deﬁcit will gradually
work it’s way down during the
course of the year.” said Schwart-
zman. “The ‘Budget Cutback/ln-
come Line Reduction' plan
should reduce the deficit by at
least one half.” he added.

The deficit this year-in com
parison to previous deﬁcits is a lot
smaller. “We’re not here to make
money,” said Gawley, “if we had

. a surplus of the samezsize. that

wouldn't beright either.”

Approximately 9,200 students
pay a student activity fee each
year and SA works with a budget
of about $1,000,000.

“There’s never a point in time
when we have that much
money," said Scwartzman.
“because it is not remitted to us
from student accounts and
because student groups are always
spending money.” . ..

“Each group will be affected
differently by the budget cut."
said Schwartzman. “Some of the
larger groups will be losing
thousands of dollars whereas a
smaller group may lose $50. This
550 may seem like a greater loss to
the smaller group because of the
size of their organizational
budget.” he added.

“1 feel'that the budget cuts
won’t hurt the groups as bad as
might have been expected." said
SA’s Programming Director Bet-
ty Ginzburg. “The programming
ofﬁce has known about the
budget cuts for a while and is now
preparing for any changes that
may result because of them." she
said. '

“Because of the 21 drinking
age." said Ginzburg. “groups
will have to look for creative,
non-alcoholic programming
ideas." anyway. “While the
budget cuts may have more im-
pact on smaller groups." said
Ginzburg. “imaginative program-
ming should put them back on
mp1.

“Groups both made and spent
more money last year. By work-
ing closely with the controller's
of fice, we will be monitoring how
groups are spending most of their
money." said Ginzburg.

“1 can’t see how the budget cut
will affect the radio station. it‘s
just something we'll have to live
with.” said Jon Cosin, General
Manager of WCDB.

“The only problem 1 can
foresee is with the broadcast of
sports events like basketball and
football games. Also. we'll have
to cut back on some equipment
we were planning on purchasing
this year. But most of the money
we needed we got. SA is letting us
take the 5 percent from any part
of the budget we want.” said
Cosln. Cl

evaluations_of'SUNYA faculty. and the
result of theevaluations will be compiled
for students ‘to consult - before pre-

Legendre, Chair of the Academic Affairs
Committee of Central Council.

“SCATE (Student Course and Teacher
Evaluation) hasn't been done in years‘. not
since 1975." said Legendre, adding. “it
takes a lot of effort." v

The last survey. called ACT ill (Assess-
ment of courses and teachers). was dif-
ﬁcult to use as it was just statistics. and no

- narrative. It was very hard to follow,”

shew said. . .

“The main reason we’re doing this is to
help people select courses. especially for
gen ea [general education requirements]
and because of the' ‘W' policy." said
Legendre. “it will be great working along
side with peer advisement." She added.

“We're going todistribute the findings
widely." said Legendre. “A couple of
thousand dollars has been set aside in the
SA budget for it.” she added.

“We will be working with (Associate)
Vice President for Academic Affairs
Harry Hamilton and Pat Terenzini, special
assistant to President O’Leary." Legendre
added that the SCATE project is being
coordinated with the SUNYA
administration. ' .

“A couple of years ago, the University

Senate passed a bill that required all.
courses to be monitored and we'll be work-., .

ing with them," said Legendre. “The!
resulting book will be either very cheap or
free," shesaid. _ i ~

Currently. both SUNY-Buffalo and
SUNY-Binghamton have SCATE's. accor~
ding to‘Legendre. “Buffalo has a whole
course on how. to do SCATE,” she;said,

ing a member of the University Senate
Council on promotions, this is deﬁnitely a
fact,” he said.

“i think that SCATE offers students an
excellent opportunity to evaluate and pro-
perly select courses at SUNY by looking at
the judgements and comments of their“
peers." said McCann.

“in light of the ‘W’," he continued.
“students have less time to decide on
whether to drop a course. SCATE

An estimated sum of money that could
be as much as $5,000 is.sitting unused
while the weight room it was intended to
renovate remains unchanged.

The money was raised through a series
of fundraisers last spring for the “Ed
Kelly Memorial Fund.”

Kelly. ‘11 member of the Class of '85
dred on January 24, 1985. from a cerebral
hemorrhage. He was a business major and
played on the lacrosse and rugby teams. 1

According to Eric Sehwartzman. Con-
troller of Student AssOCiation (SA). the
1 money‘ raised for the Ed Keliy' Memorial
Fund was deposited into a fund that has
since beenclosed out.

The balance of money. estimated by
Schwartzman. to be $5.000 was then
transfered to a University account- to be as-

Ed Keliymemorial funds left unused

ed toward improving the weight room in
the University Gym and renaming the
weight roomrin memory of Kelly..

However. no changes have been made in
the weight room as of yet.

According to Ehysical Education
Facilities Coordinator Dennis Elkin,
former SA president Rich Schaffer was in
charge of the memorial fund. Schaffer
dedicated a plaque to Kelly at the 1985
commencement exercises which now hangs
in the weight room. .

Schaffer was also working with
Athletics Director Bill Moore to begin
preparations for the improvement of the
room. ~

Current SA Pesident Steve Gawley said
he is not in charge of the account and
doesn’t know who is responsible for seeing

that the money is properly channeled into
the weight room. “Rich Schaffer was in
charge of that last year," he said.

According to Moore, he is “definitely
aware" _that the money is there waiting to
be put to use and that “eventually there
will be an expanded room." The sum of
money. which he estimated to be only
$1.600 will be used to expand and add new
equipment to the weight room.

it is only about one month into the year
and the project just hasn’t had time to be
started. said Moore.

When it does begin. he said. he will
receive recommendations from Charles
Priore and Edward Zaloom. who are in
charge of the free weights program, about
the exact improvements that are to be
made. They “will get going,” be said. but
“there hasn’t been enough time yet. " D
