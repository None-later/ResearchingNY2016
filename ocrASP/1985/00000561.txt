ASRC receives grant

The Atmospheric Sciences Research Center
(ASRC) has been awarded a $3.5 million grant by
the Federal government to investigate the death of
forests in the eastern United States.

The ASRC will coordinate its research with other
atmospheric scientists and forest specialists through
the East to evaluate the effect ‘of atmosphere con-
taminants on forests.

The project. funded‘by the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency, will use ASRC‘s Whiteface Moun-
tain Field Station to collect data about the Adiron-
dacks, where thin soil levels have difﬁculty
neutralizing acid rain. ‘ ‘_ ‘ ,

A federal court in Philadelphia recently ruled
that Temple University must let military recruiters
on campus, despite the fact that the military pro-
hibits homosexuality. '

Military wins battle

According to Temple University officials,
Philadelphia's anti-dcscrimination laws forced the
school to bar the military. However, U.S. district
court judge James Giles said in his decision that
military rules supercede local laws.

Last year. SUNYA’s Student Association sought I

to deny military recruiters a table in the Campus
Center, but was overruled by the university
administration.

What a bargain!

SUNYA students riding the bus from the uptown
campus to Crossgates Mail will no longer be paying
a two zone fare of 80 cents.

The Capital District Transit Authority (CDTA)
has removed the existing zone boundary at the in-
tersection of Washington Avenue and Fuller Road,
which reduces the fare to Crossgatcs by twenty

‘ cents.

‘On April I, 1985. CDTA increased its base fare
by ten cents. The reduction of the fare to
Crossgates is part of phase two of CDTA’s rate
restructuring program. '

Study the ‘non-West"

(Intercollegiate Press} 7 Bowdoin College recently
adopted a “non~west‘em” studies requirement to

 

replace a four-year old Foreign Studies
requirement. ' ; i

As ammended, the requirement reads: ‘fStudents
must take twp courses with major focus on a
culture or society of Asia, Africa, Latin America,
or Russia. ' The requirement is intended to in-
tro'duce students to cultures fundamentally dif-
ferent from their own.” , I‘ -

Debate about the requirement concerned both
the effectiveness of the proposal in. achieving its
aim, and the desirability of these aims themselves.

RZA aims at summit

The November l9summit meeting in Geneva bet— '
ween Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev will
encompass mainly weapon issues. but there will
probably be pressure from President Reagan about
Soviet jewry as well. V ' t

The Revisionist Zionist Alternative '(RZA) feels
President Reagan will make this issue amajor one
at the bargaining table. ‘ ‘He (Reagan) says thatthis
is a major concern that must be dealt with," said
RZA President Robin Berloff. ‘ . 1

During the Festival of Sukkot. petitions about
the summit are being distributed. On November
10, RZA will participate in a rally on The Soviet
Consulate in New York. Other activites protesting
decreasing Soviet Jewish immigration will take
place throughout this semester. said Berloff.

U. of Arizona divests

(Intercollegiate Press) - Arizona’s Board of Regents
has voted to sell its stock In companies that do
business in South Africa, making the University of

"Arizona the 17th college to approve divestiture

since April, when-major student protests of campus
investment in the segragationist country broke out.

But the University of Vermont and South Illinois
University trustees eschewed total divestiture, op-
ting in votes last week to invest only in firms that
sign the Sullivan Principles, the business civil rights
code.

Anti-apartheid Florida students, meanwhile, pro-
tested a new prohibition of camping on campus.
Officials conceded the rule was aimed at stopping
sit-ins, but added that it won’t apply to students
camping out for tickets to the Gator Growl, the bi,g,,I

As the University prepares to-
upgrade the current mainframe
computer system, on-ca’mpus
computer user'rooms have been
relocated to‘provlde better access
for students. '

A mainframe is a large‘scale
computer system designed for use
with many desk-top terminals.
One of Albany’s mainframes, the
Sperry 1100-83, is over 20 years
old. . ‘
The computer terminals in the
user rooms were moved this fall
to create more space as well as to
accomodate student needs. The
15 computer terminals and 5 IBM
microcomputers were relocated
from C822. to LC 15 and LCD 27.

“The main reason for changing
the rooms.” said Leif Hartmark.
acting Director of the Computing
Center, “was to try and improve
the service and allow students
greater access to the computers.”

Hartmark said he felt that the
microcomputers weren't getting
enough use in CS 22 in the Com-
puting Center and by relocating
them to a more accomodating
area, students would be ' more
likely to use them. Although the
user terminals have always been
in demand. they are now being
“heavily used” in the new room.

' The old user room,_ CS 22. is
now a professional consulting of-
ﬁce, said Patricia M. Panzl,
Associate Director of User Ser-
vices. “The Consulting Office is a
more visible and more obvious
place for students and faculty to

get help,” she said.

Pleased with the recent reloca—
tions, Panzl thinks LC 15 will be
better equipped to suit student
needs. The room is more like a
classroom, she said, adding. “it
teaches students hands-on in-
struction by allowing an up-

midnight. “The theme is black

ding that parent's should try to
dress in black and white for the
dance.

Parent's Weekend continues on
Sunday with two brunches, one at
9:45 in the CC'cafeterla, and one
at 10:30 in the Ballroom. “There
was originally going to be three,"
Pearlman said. “but lack of ticket
sales forced us to cut it to two."

Gerhard’s eviction is only the
second one Gebhardt said he
knows of, although there may be
more students who found housing
without contacting OCHO. he
added. “Even though two sounds
small, I don't know how many
other people are out there.“
Gebhardt stated. ,

Both Martonc and Pogue said
they had not been netifled of the
city’s action despite a long stan-
ding agreement that Pogue would
be notified of pending evictions.
“I don't know if the student has
been evicted by the landlord or
the city." said Pogue.

According to Albany Bureau of
Code Enforcement Director Mike
Alvaro, “294 Quail Street was a
Bead example of SUNY and the
city and the landlord working
together" because the student is

questions while doing the pro-

‘blems themselves."

There have been few problems
with this new computer set-apt
according to Panzl. “We hope to
encourage more students to use

. the tenninals.“ she said.

Most of: the students who use
the computer terminals are taking

,study and can be beneﬁcial to

alrriost any major. she said.

Funding for the relocation of
the user rooms was provided by
thew Student Computing Access
Program (SCAP). The program
was established by the New York
Legislature, making it mandatory
for SUNY students to pay a $25
fee added to their tuition. I

10-year-old machine, Hartmark
said. “The new computer, a
Sperry 1100-91, has double the
speed. powerI and capacity," he
said. The upgrading should begin
to take place sometime this
month, Hartmark said.

The new mainframe will be
funded by the state. The method
of payment has not yet been
disclosed. although Albany hopes

to purchase a new machine in-
stead of leasing one, Hartmark
said. The upgrading should be
completed with two years and an
actual new system should be in
place within five years, he said.
When asked how long the en-
tire process of buying and
upgrading new equipment would
take, Hartman said, “I don’t
really know. There’s always a de-
mand that exceeds the supply."
