Politics, technology, both effect

implementation of M‘Stari Wars’ I

By James S. Thompson ‘

Avoiding the controversies sur-
rounding his topic Tuesdoy night,
Physics Professor Dr. Keith
Rntcliffe gave an, instructicinal
lecture on the Strategic Defense
lnitiatve, better known to its
critics as “Star Wars." ,

Star Wars is a part of President
Reagan’s military arms build-up
which has been assailed by critics
as a dangerous escalation of the
arms race. The idea is to construct
a system that would destroy in-
coming nuclear missiles, but op-
ponents say it is impossible to
create a reliable anti-missile
system.

Star Wars has evoked much
response from Moscow whether
positive or negative. Ratcliffe
said, “The mere consideration of '
such a plan has drawn more atten-
tion from the Soviets than any
previous projects.”

Ratcliffe stated that for a plan
to be successful it must satisfy
three requirements: operation, in-
vulnerability and relatively low
cost. The advances beTng made in
the field of nuclear weapons has
provided pin point accuracy, he
said. explaining that a missile
launched 3,000 miles away will
miss its target by no more than
l50 meters. This fact forces a
defense system to be that much
better.

“Strategic Defense Initiative.
or SDI. represents a good ap-
proach to helping along a
diplomatic solution. It is an en-
couragement for negotiations, if
nothing else." Rntcliffe told his
audience. Star Wars is not a blue
print waiting to be built. but dif-
ferent defenses under considera-
tion, he added.

being given time to find another
place to live.

Gerhard said the city may have
been tipped off to the Grouper
Law violation by summer sublet—
tcrs who put four names on the
mailbox and one of whom got in-
to a minor fight with the
neighbors. “All they (Alvaro's
ofﬁce) would tell us was that they
had a complaint." he said.

Alvaro said the city’s policy

Contrary to popular belief,
Star Wars is not a single system,
but rather it is three different and
separate options. The most that
comes to the minds of most peo-
ple, he said, is the beam weapons.
These weapons, Ratcliffe explain-
ed, would use lasers, streams of

electrons, X-rays or magnetic
beams to destroy attacking
missiles.

Although beam weapons would
be an effective defense since it
does not involve nuclear material,
itis neither cheap nor invincible.

Current funding for Star Wars
is for research only, Ratcliffe
said. “The goal is to have enough
research done by l992 to be able
to make a decision as to deploy-
ment or termination." he
explained.

Another idea being studied is
the Kinetic Eneigy method, in
which an ordinary rocket would

was to give the University time to
build extra dorms by only in-
vestigating housing when com-
plaints have been ﬁled. “We get
about three calls a day,” he said,
adding that complaints are down
"substantially" from last year.

“I have l25 places I could
move on tomorrow . . . we are
working on a complaint basis,"
Alvaro stated. explaining that
most complaints were about
noise, trash, and parking.

be ﬁred at its target and the colli-
sion would create fatal damage to
a nuclear missile.~With current
technology, though, the system
'vVould fail because the rockets do
not travel much faster than the
missiles themselves, and therefore

I I the intercept time is much too

long. '

Another plan is called the Rail
Gun system, which ﬁres projec-
tiles at a target. The system is in-
suffiient, however, for the'same
reason as the Kinetic Approach —
lack of acceleration. ' ‘

“People working on Star Wars
are still in‘ the gadget phase,” said
Ratcllffe. "The problems do not
lie in the physics but the computer
software." because In opera'tion
the system' would use computers
to perform'all of the necessary
functions. He added, "We dc-
pcnd on computers to detect
missiles, track them. choose
targets, determine fake warheads,
launch and assess kills."

The nature of an attack would
take less than half an hour from

boost phase, where the missiles '

engines warm up. to-re-entry
from space. A defense system
would have to destroy the majori-
ty of these targets in the boost
phase, and therefore time is
everything, he said.

There is no time for the judge- '

ment of a president or general,
said Ratcliffc, taking the decision
to use out of human hands.
“There is absolutely no room for

human reaction in the event of a.

nuclear war," said Dr. Ratcliffe.
adding, “another fact is a com:
putcr must be able to perform
under the circumstances of 'a
nuclear attack, where some of its
functions may be disabled." El

As for Gerhard, who says the
landlord knew and accepted four
checks each month for the rent,
he’s not sure where he'll be living
in the next few weeks. “I don’t
know, I was supposed to be out
already —- I'm not sure where I'm!
going to go.” ‘

“We knew that we were break—
ing the law but we made the deci-
sion at long time ago.” he said,
adding, “we figured we wouldn’t
get caught. " El

” *ICAC' hopes programs "have "

students runningvtdaspo'lts

By Jim Avery.  '- ' . gr

To breathcmew life into SUNYA's
athletics, changes will have to bc made in
the intercollegiate Athletics' committee

(ICAC). according to it's new. chair Mark ‘

Rivers. .
ICAC’has primarily been a budgetary
committee dividing ‘élrn'bst 250,000 I , .

year, between SUNYA’s athlétfd  _

The money comes out of the student activi-

ty fee, but the committee has [a history of

deﬁcit spending. -' . I ’
“It’s the studentsi money that's going

into the 'ICAC programs." said Rivers. “it ‘

should be thechair who plays an impor-
tant part in what happens to-the money,
from budgets to planning, at every level,”
he added. _ , v , .

Rivers has 'dchlopcd a wide-ranging
plan addressing both monetary concerns

and increasing school spirit. “The students _

should get the. most out of what they pay

in,” he said. adding that hc'hop'cs to see,

the two endsof his goals feed off one
another, building momentum as the year
progresses. ‘ >

The central  of ‘Rivers’ plan is the'

formation of a booster club to support the
Danes. and raising money independently
through various methods. The booster
club would then put that money into
athletics through an ongoing fund.

“it could fund sports which might not
otherwise get the money. Hockey is a club
— we'd like to turn it into an inter-
collegiate," said Rivers. adding that “fur-

ther on down the line, we might decide to ,

light up the football field so we can play
‘night games. With this fund the money
would be there.” ‘

Rivers has designed a new athleticlogo.
and he said he hopes to market it on sweat-
shirts, mugs and banners. Proﬁts will be
added to the lCAC’s fund.

Promotion is another of Rivers concerns
as he hopes to hold some events off-
cnmpus, increasing ICAC’s visibility

By Hillary Flnk

'Students have been “very enthusiastic”
about signing up for the new Student Ad-
vocacy and Rights Coalition (SARC), ac-
cording to one of the group’s organizers.
in fact. students are joining in numbers far
exceeding what was originally hoped for.

Phil Botwinick, the SARC coordinator
for State Quad, said. “On Monday,
September 30, on dinner lines we had
several people running table sign-ups for
SARC. The students were very responsive:
in fact. most students were more than will-

ing to sign up once we told them we would '

be informing them about important stu-
dent issues." '

SARC organizers “started with an
original goal of 2.000. We' now have at
least 2,900, and it’s still moving,"- said
Steve Gawley. Student Association presi-
dent and the person responsible for getting
SARC organized and underway. He add-
ed. “thc response has been fantastic. It’s
signiﬁcant having all of these people sign
up and giving permission to call them."

SARC started with a two day recruit-
ment drive which was extended to u~full
week because the response was so strong.
They wanted to make sure they got to
every door on all five quads, and will most
likely be tabling in the Campus Center to
reach off-campus students, as well.

According to Jeff Rosen, the coor-
dinator for Colonial Quad. “about 95 per--
cent of studctns who were asked to sign up
said yes." SARC, he said, “Is a good idea
and a good we ,to keep people Informed."

Dutch Quud‘ coordinator John Glar-
russo added, “Almost everyone who we
approached didn't have any problem with
signing or becoming Involved. They were
really happy an effort was made to unify
the student body. No one had any animosi-
ty or minded our going door—to-door.” Of
the students who said no, he said; he

through media coverage. “I want to use »
Heritage Park to reach out into the com-
munity. This in ‘turn  . bring more .
students in,". hé'said. Riv‘msald it might

be possible to holda lacrosse doubleheader
‘ in‘ the park in the near future.‘

Besides taking events eff-campus,
Rivers would like to bring special events
onto campus, including championship
wrestling. According“ to Rivers, exhibitions
by the Harlem Globetrotters. and guest
speakers like George: Steinbrcnncr and
Howard Cosell are being considered.

“We wgnt to make people aware thitt we
are one of the ﬁnest Division ill' schools. in

the country,” Rivers said, adding that

“Unlike many schools, SUNYA is com-
mitted to building.” As proff of our
school’s athletic abilities. Rivers cited that
Coach Munsey had just celebrated his
200th victory track meet in cross country.

“No matter what we do, Albany will
never be a Division I team. It's a matter of
making the most of it,"_ said Rivers.
“Other Division 111 schools make athletics
an important part of campus life," he
added. ‘

According to Rivers, ICAC is not just
athletics. but entertaihnient. and this in-
cludes halftime shows with bands or an
organized tug of war contest. “Sports will
be playing an increasing role. Things will
be shifting, especially with the 21 year old
drinking age," he said.

When asked about the “Bubble,” amini
sports arena to be built near the gym.
Rivers said “The .bubble will definitely
spark more interest. The main thing it will
do is free up space" in the gym. The hub-
ble, which will provide temporary indoor
room for the teams until the ﬁeldhousc is
completed in 1988 will be ready for use in
the spring ’86 season. _

Overall, Rivers is expecting a good yepr,
and a new commitment to a growing
athletic department. His main goal is “to
get more students out there." CI

SA RC popular with students

thinks it's “just bechase they’re scared of
getting in trouble with their name on a list,
even though it was stressed that they
wouldn't get in trouble — especially with
two to three thousand names. At most. so
far, ﬁve refused to sign.” '

Larry Hartman, a member of the SARC
steering committee and a chair of the SA ‘
Student Action Committee, said, “SARC
is an information network to give students '
news before it happens. it is a good idea as
far as getting students more involved in
what’s happening and so any student can
feel comfortable getting involved with
SAID!

Not only are students signed up. but
campus groups have designated represen-
tatives that sit on the SARC Board, said
Gawlcy. The number of groups

“If a studént issue arises that would un-

is cur obligation as well as responsibility to
educate students to these issues," said
Botwinick.
. Oiarrusso added that one of the issues
that SARC could become involved with is
the alcohol policy. "More than half of the
people who signed up were concerned with
the alcohol policy. They are willing to rally
to be able to drink on campus. They said
just to give them a call."
