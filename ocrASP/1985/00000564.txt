The Music Department sponsors six different ensembles.

Ensembles right on key when
Students seek muS‘ical outlets

By Caryn Mlske
_ STAFF WRITER
“Join a. music department
ensemble” read the most recent
leaflet plastered across the
podium and although most
students have seen the signs,
many are probably unsure about
what comprises an ensemble”
The music department sponsors
six different ensembles, and while
students can get credit for par-

‘ ticipating, Prof. David Janower,

'.who runs both the University
Chorale and Chamber Singers,
pointed, out. ‘ ‘a large majority, of
the students join the ensembles
without receiving credit." _ ‘

He went on to discuss the dif-
ferences between the two choral
ensembles he organizes. “Any
university should provide a place
where students, regardless of
talent, can get together and sing,"

said Janowcr. This function is

provided by the University
Chorale, which has 100 members
and does not base membership on
auditions.

\ “As long as one attends the
two meetings per week, you're
in," commented Janower. The
ensemble is comprised of
students, faculty. staff and
townspeople and presents two on
campus concerts per year.

The Chamber Singers, on the
other hand. is a select group of
students who perform while tour-
ing, presenting “to 20 concerts
per year. Students must audition
in order to gain membership,
which enables the group to re-
main small, Janowcr said. Ap-
proximately 20 students belong,
and as Janowcr pointed out, “We
sing without accompanicment. so
its beneficial for the group to be
small and portable and therefore
cheap to transport."

The Chamber Singers not only
present their services for official
university and state functions. but
this year Will present a concert In
Massachusetts and offer their
talents to nursing homes and
hospitals. The biggest production
is their Christmas show, which
features a Madrigal Dinner and Is

ministration. It will be more In our favor."
"Representatives will be giving calls when an im-
portant issue arises. If we feel there's a need that
students be informed on issues. and if necessary, to
mobilize students to react and swiftly and forcefully

scenery, costume and dance in the
Campus Center Ballroom.

The Chamber Singers, as a
group, are often paid for their
performances. Janower said,
although they do present some
concerts free of charge. Since the,
University‘Music Department has
an insufficient budgia‘t' 't‘d‘fully

‘fund the ensemble, any monies

made by the groups are used for
expenses, Janowcr added.
Members also run a coffee shop
which sells donuts and candy bars
to raise extra money.
_-.lcnnifcr,$gui:glia, a sophomore
in the Chamber Singers, explain-
ed, “I joined the group'becausc I
enjoy singing and like the positive
atmosphere one has in a small

"ensemble." Contrary to popular

belief, not everyone in the ensem-
ble is a music major. Sgucglia is a
prospective business majorwho,
when asked is all the hard work
was worth one credit, replied,
“No. We meet twice a week for
one hour and forty minutes. Then
i still have to practice on my own
from three to ﬁve hours a week.
You really have to enjoy making
music.~ I do it for enjoyment and
enrichment." .

‘ Penni Newman, (a junior, has
been interested in singing since
high school. “It must become se-
cond nature for the group to
work together_as a whole." she
said. Another student humorous-
ly added, “it’s a superb contrast
to the rigors of academics, and it
sure beats tennisl”

The Symphonic Band, under
the direction of Professor Henry

‘Carr, does not require auditions

and has approximately 50
members. They present four on-
campus concerts 3 year. Con-
versely, the University Communi-
ty Orchestra, which is composed
of both students and community
members is audition only.
However, director Nathan Got-
tschalk, emphasized, “We are
always looking for new par-
ticipants. There are many
students who are not music ma-
jors but have been well trained in
playing an instrument. This gives
students an opportunity to keep

up their talent."

The 50 members present two
performances each semester, with
the first concert scheduled for Do-
tobcr 29 at 8:00 in the Main
theatre in the Performing Arts
Center. It will be an all Russian
performance. presented in con-
junction with the University
Chorale.

In the past. a small group from
the Orchestra has also played for
theatre productions on campus.

The University Percussion
Ensemble, directed by Richard
Albagli, is the most exotic and in-
novative of the ensembles.
Albain is a graduate of
Rensselacr Polytechnic Institute
(RPl), Eastman and is also the
Principal Pcrcussionist of the
Albany Symphony.

Albain explained that percus-
sion instruments produce sound
by striking two objects together,
and said there is a limitless range
of timbres since one can use
anything from flower. pots and
iron pipes to the more conven-
tional drums and xylophonc. The

music tends to be avante gnrde .

and is capable of being both
melodic and rythmic, he added.

The ensemble has I0 members
and gives three major perfor-
mances a year. in addition, the
touring ensemble plays at both
elementary and high schools.

A third performing group is the
University Rag-Time Mallet
Ensemble, which plays the music
of Scott Joplin and songs from
shows like Star Wars, Music
Man, and West Side Story.

Lastly, the University Jazz
Ensemble is directed by Professor
Ray Rcttig, a noted area jazz
musician who graduated from
Berkley College of Music in I976.
The ensemble, which Rettig form-

' cd six years ago, has performed

for the governor, at the Conven-
tion Center at the Empire Plaza
and at various nightclubs.

Rettig commented, “We’ll play
anywhere -— we're open to sug-
gestion." Also, towards the end
of the semester they will play at
the Rathskellur on Monday or
Thursday nights. [3

stand up for their rights," said Roscn.

Hartman said he thinks “activism Is on the rise
on campus and across the country. I think SARC is
just an answer to all the cries for more responsive
action that students really care about." El
