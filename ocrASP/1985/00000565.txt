By Mark Mlshler

Last week’s coiumrt provided a
brief overview’of SUNYA’s on-
campus judicial system. This arti-
cie presents more detail regarding
the procedures and offers advice
for students who find themselves
unwilling participants in the pro-
cess. The views expressed here. are
not necessarily those of the
u n i v e r s i t y y
administration. . 

Students are  ’
‘read the Stu- .
dent Guidelines 
(copies are available in AD-129)
and arrive at their own conclu-
sions. Keep in mind that every
-situation is unique and that this
article is not a substitute for in-

' dividual legal advice. -
If I am accused of violating a‘

campus rule, can I be arrested as

‘ well as referred?

Yes. If your alleged misconduct

violates a criminal law as well as a

university rule, you can be both
arrested and referred. The pro-

' cedures are totally separate.

If I am accused of academic
dishonesty. can I be penalized by
my professor as well as referred?

Yes. Your professor can alter-

jyour grade in response to his or
‘ her belief that you cheated and

you can be referred for the same
alleged act of academic dishones-
ty. The procedures are separate.
This means that the results will
‘not necessarily be consistent, i.e.,
you might be found innocent of

1 academic dishonesty at a judicial

board hearing but your professor
might still fail you based on his or

;_ her belief that you cheated.

Academic grievances are handl-

ed by the; particular-y academic
department}: if you: disagree, with .
a grading dEcision of‘a‘professdi‘,‘ ‘
check your department .for - the"
appeal procedure. I

Are all types of disciplinary
sanctions the university imposes
governed by . the Student
Guidelines? ' .V . .  I

No. Several university-imposed 1:
sanctions are not included inithe
“Student Guidelines” and the
procedural protections afforded ’
you under the “Guidelines”
therefore may not be available to '
you. - ' "'~-:

For example. the “Guidelincs"é
does not govern the process w en
the University places a “hold’ ﬁn
your registration or- transcript
based upon allegedly unpaid bills.
According to the‘university. you
have no right to a hearing or to be
notified that the university
believes you owe them money
before the university places a hold
on your records. ‘

The procedures in the
“Guidelines” also do not cover
“administrative” removals from
residence balls. The university
claims the right 'to reassign rooms
or to' remove a student from a
dorm for “administrative”
reasons. Even if the reassignment
is directly in response to alleged
misconduct on'yourl part, you do
not have the right to a'hcttring or
advance notice of the charges.

Finally, as mentioned above,
academic decisions are not
governed ‘by the procedures in the
“Guidelines, ’-’ even if the decision
is a penalty for alleged .
‘misconduct.’ '

hearing or the evidence which will
be used against me? I  "

' The" “Guidelines” do not
create an affirmative obligation
on the part of. the university to
discolse the evidence against you

‘ prior to thegheai'lng. There is no

clear answte  to‘whether the Of-

; ﬂag: of the‘Vice-Prerident for Stu- _
dent Affairs may'allow access to.

evidence ‘if such access is re-
quested by the referred s't'udent. "

"If it appears that there isl'impor-

It'aht documentary or physical
evidence in the possession o'f.;the

Office of the Vice-President for

.V Studc‘ntgAffairs, I suggest that 
 yousmak’e a ‘vvritten request ’prior;

to the hearing thatyou be allowed
access td’this evidence. There-
quest should indicate that you
need. to have access to the
evidence in order to prepare your
case and should list, in as much
detail' as possible, the evidence
you desire to examine. ' .

If your request is not granted,

' point out at your hearing that you

requested certain evidence. that
your request was denied, and that
you believe the denial had a
detrimental impact on your abili-
ty to adequately prepare for the
hearing.

Can I be represented by an at-
torney if I am referred?-

No. The “Guidelines” permits
you to have an "advisor," who
can be an attorney, present with
you at the judicial hearing. The
advisor is not allowed 'to speak
for you or toquestion witnesses.
all he or she' can do is consult
privately with you during the
hearing. . t A _.,A -_ .

Do I have the““rlght to remain

silent” at judicial hearings?
“Thevw“Guidclines” does not
specifically answer this question.

My'opinion is that this constituv.

tionally protected right.does exist
for students in university
disciplinary procedures. Exercise
of the right to remain silent may
,be particularly important if you
'.have been arrested in addition to
.being referred, as anything you

say at an (In-campus judicial hear:

ing could be used against you at a
criminal trial.

Can I receive a more serious
penhlty than another student
charged with'the same violation?

Yes. Penalties may be based
‘not only on the seriousness of the
misconduct, but upon the pror
“record” of the referred student.
in addition, different boards or
hearing officers might give dif-
ferent penalties for similar
violations.

People will be able to wear hats
year round and in class' too, which
will give the service more publici-
ty, she added.

According to Maglione, over 75
people showed up at the service’s
interest meeting. “We want to en-
courage people to get involved in
the program or to use the pro-
gram,” she said. “The more
escorts you have, the more people
you can escort.” »

25 people used the service last

What can i do if I believe i have
been treated unfairly in the
university judicial system?

As described in last week’s arti-
cle. you have a right to appeal a
disciplinary decision. If your ap-
peal: is denied, you might be able
to take the university to court,
althought the courts have been
reluctant to interfere in internal
university matters.

Remember to consult an at-
torney if you believe you have
been teated unfairly. Also
remember that university policy is
based, in part, upon input from
students. if you think the pro-
cedures are unfair, get involved in
the on-campus governance pro-
cesses and work for change from
within the university structure.

last year, which is a lot,” she said.

“i think that Don’t Walk
Alone acts as a deterrent," Oran—
soff said. “People would be more
prone to do something irrational
when they see one person walking
by themself than when they walk
with others,” she added. Oran-
soff said, however. that this cam-
pus is not dangerous.

According to Maglione, the ser-
vice operates Sunday through
Thursday from 8 to H p.m., and
their number is 442-55ii., She
stressed that more volunteers are
needed, for Sunday and Thursday
nights in particular. D
