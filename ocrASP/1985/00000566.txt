Algbanygbowlers enter league

’aysaIPereana' ’ " ‘

‘This past Sunday. the Gover-
ning I Board of the Tri-State
College Bowling Conference ‘
voted unanimously to accept a
men’s and women '5 team from
SUNYA as full participating
teams for the 1985-86 season.

The decision is a culmination
of the three-year effort by the
Bowling Club to gain entrance
into the only recognized‘inter-
collegiate bowling league in the

‘ vicinity of the Capital District.‘

In addition to admittance in-
to the conference, Albany State
will host one of the eight league
tournaments. The tournament
is tentatively set for Sunday,
November 17 and it will be held

at an outside bowling center in
the Albany area. Campus
Lanes, the IZ-lme'onumpus
bowing center, cannot hold
the ten men’s.tea'ms and live
women’s teams.

The men’s squad consists‘of
six bowlers, while the ‘women

have four players bowling each =

game. Each tournament con-
sists of six games, three in the

team event and three doublvs h .

games. The competing teams
‘ can. win trophies for‘the two in-
dividual. doubles, and team
events of (each tournament,
while the tournament scores
also count toward team
standings. "

“He’s not 100 percent, but he’s
getting his speed back," said
Ford. “He hasn't even hit 100
yards yet in three games, and he's
a lOOO-yard rusher." ~
To beat the Chiefs, the Danes
must contain Brian Timbrook, a
quarterback with blazing speed
and a very quick‘release, said
Ford. Other key players include
6’4", 225 lb. tight end Steve
Smith and Stacy Eason, a
dangerous kickoff and punt
returner. r
_ “We need to get a win to get

some confidence back," said
DeLong. “We need to win
‘against a tough opponent, and
any team that can go with Ithaca
15-10 is a good team.”

Perhaps the biggest difference
between the team that faced
Ithaca three weeks ago and the
team that the Chiefs will play
Saturday is the play of Milano.

Coming off a year layoff,
Milano was rusty against the
Bombers. But he looked like the
signal-caller of old against RP!
and Brockport, moving the team

lacked that cocky feeling that
good quarterbacks have. Mike’s a
leader, and he drives people. He
didn't have that quality to lead
people in Ithaca. He had it the
last two weeks. but it's easier to
have that against Brockport and
RPI."
