‘ The Albany State women’s cross coun-
try teams' record dropped to 94-] after
suffering a loss on Tuesday to a strong
Smith College team.

, , in what was a highly contested battle
between the two 1984 NCAA Division Ill
qualifying teams, host Smith College com-
piled 23 points, Albany 36, and Mount
Holyoke College 73. Oneonta, due to in-
adequate numbers did not score.

The 2.95 mile cotirse is "very challeng-
ing" according to Albany‘s head coach
Ron White. White added that “this is a
completely different Smith team than last
year's." During the 1984 season. Albany
beat Smith at the Easterns. but lost to
them in Ohio at the NCAA‘s. The two
teams will meet up again in October at the
Easterns. ' -

Co-captain Karen DeFeo placed first for
Albany and second overallwith a time of
19:27. Teammate Kim Petrichord, running

twenty seconds behind DeFeo. placed third
overall. Smith took the next ﬁve spots.
Sophomore Roseanne Smith, “runner of
the meet.” was a solid ninth. Kitty
Sullivan was tenth followed by Freshman
Marylou Webster. ' '

The Danes continue to be plagued by in-

‘ juries. “it was a disappointment in know-

ing we have the runners to beat that type of
Smith team." White said adding, “We did
our best, i felt it was a challenging course
with some of the best footing I‘ve ever
seen.” - .
The quadrangular meet Tuesday marked

, the end of dual-meet competition. The rest

of the'meets on the agenda are

I invitationals.

Saturday, the Danes will compete in the
LeMoyne Invitational in Syracuse. The
region will come together for the first time '
over a demanding course. This should be
an indication to the Albany team of what's
to come. L‘l

Going, into Wednesday's home game .-
against Union College, a team rankedse- '

cond in New York State and eighth na--
tionally. the expectations. of the Albany
State men’ssoccer‘ team were mixed. r

“We didn’t quite have the intensitle .

think going into thegame we expected to

lose," said midfielder Warren Manners. »'

"What was definitely in ouriminds was the
fact that Union defeated Cortland 6-1, the

same score Cortland beat us by' on

Saturday.” ,

However, also in the-Danes’ minds was ‘5. 3

the result of last years‘ game. in 'which
Union had defeated Albany in the last
minute of the game.

“That gives,us.incentive," said head'

coach Bob Schieffelin. “We're going into
the game with nothing to lose.”

The result of this mixed attitude was a
2-1 Albany loss. a tough loss for the Danes
to accept. who led through most of the

game. .

“We had a different strategy going into
this game," said co-captain Cari loos.
“Against Cortland, we had tried to run
with them. which didn’t work because they
were so much faster and better condition-
ed. For this game, weboxed in our own
defensive side and let Union come to us."

“We let them get to our midﬁeld line,
letting Union have their own half. We’d let
them get all bunched-up. then we‘d try to
get the ball over the bunch,” said senior
defenseman Frantz Michel.

This is what happened 20:55 into the
first half. Michel executed a long pass to
co-captain Tihan Presbie for the game's
first goal. . ‘

“if Tihan beats out his defender," said
loos, “99 times out of NO the ball will go
in. His play inspires the whole team.”

Both Union goals were scored in the se-
cond half of the game. At 69:50 from the

ﬁrst kickoff, Union's Bob Crandall scored
indirectly on a free kick.

“That goal was scored as a result of
momentary confusion," said Michel.
“One man was unmarked, someone didn't
stay with him and there was confusion as
to who was supposed to be where.”

The‘second Union goal was scored at
72:32 by Howie Friedler. Albany made
three shots on the Union goal. versus
Union’s 24, and Dane goalie Marc Cohen
made 13 saves against one'for Union's
John LaDuke.

“We were the team we're capable of be-

 

 

 

ing out there," said loos. “it was a big
change since Saturday, a big improvement.
i guess if i keep saying we’re getting better
in every game I’ll make us sound like we're
ready to beat Clemson soon, but we are
improving."

“What we need to win is to play a little
harder. with a little extra effort.” said
Michel. “We played well out there, but we
let down for a few seconds."

The Danes’ next game is Saturday, at

,.Potsdam. The next home contest will be

Monday against Siena, at 3:30 p.m. El

Mets drop two
behind Cards
after 4-3 defeat

5. Louis

- (AP) The St. Louis Cardinals have been

through too much to start relaxing now.

After watching a 10-inning shutout
effort wasted and after watching a four-
game lead in the National, League East
with a week to playrdwindle to a one-

'game‘edge, the Cardinals were in no

mood to celebrate after they ﬁnally beat
the New York Mets 4-3 Thursday night.

.“Wecan’t have a letdown after this,”
winning pitcher Danny Cox said. “We

. still have got to beat the Cubs."

.The victory cut St. Louis’ magic

‘_ V number to two with three games left.

"‘We know we've got to win two more

ggarncs‘because i think they will win

three," Cardinals Manager Whitey Her-
zog said of the Mets.

“We can’t let up. We’ve got three
more games laft against the Cubs." said
Vince Coleman, who 'broke a H tie
with a two-run single in the fourth inn~
ing. “And they’re not going to lay down
for us." .

The Mets had 13 hits and stranded 10
base runners against ﬁve St. Louis pit-
chers. but most of the time New York
couldn’t get a hit when it counted.

“it‘s a game you’ll look at and say.
‘lf this happened . . . if we‘d made this
play . . .' but it’s baseball,” said Mets
first baseman Keith Hernandez, who
had ﬁve hits. “We had some breaks the
ﬁrst two games."

Coleman had just two hits in his
previous 20 at-bats going into the game,
but he came through with three in the
finale of the three-game series.

Cox, l8-9, allowed nine hits in six inn-
ings, but limited the Mets to two runs.
Loser Rick Aguilera. 10-7, also gave up
nine hits in six innings. El
