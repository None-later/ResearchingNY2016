A variety. of fundraising ideas are in the
works by members of Fuerza Latina in
hopes of raising at least 5,000 donors to
aid victims of the recent earthquake in
Mexico. ’ '

The September 19th earthquake,
measuring 8.1 on the Richter Scale,
devastated Mexico City, killing more than
7,000 people and leavin'gcountlcss others
homeless.

According to Niurka Pion, President of
Fuerza Latina, “The situationkcon‘cerns
all, not just Hispanics. We need everyone's
help.” Many members of the group are
from Mexico, she said. ’

To raise their immediategqalpf $5.090,

Fuerza Latina has several projedtsplgnned

in the coming months , ,, .2 ,,.-. 

On Community‘University Day, held
this past Saturday, the group set up a table
in the lecture centers to raise money- 25
percent of which will he donated to the
fund.

Fuerza Latina members will be going
door to door on a fundraising campaign
sometime this semester and will have a

- table in the Campus Center to sell T-shirts

and to solicit donations.

Plans are also being made for a dance to
which. all members of the campus com-
munity will be invited to show their sup
port. 100 percent of the money raised from
these activities will go to the Mexico fund.

Fuerza Latina will be working through
the Red Cross to send the funds to Mexico.
Plon said she would like the money “to go
to it special neighborhood. so the money
can be used immediately for food, fresh
water and shelter."

Alfredo Rodriguez, Public Affairs
Coordinator for Fuerza Latina said he sees
Mexico as “a neighboring country whose
needs we cannot ignore." He added that
he would like everyone to be generous and

to realize the urgency of the situation.

'Once they get their projects off the
ground, Fuerza Latina is planning on ask~

schools such as Union College and Renn-

of a successful appeal won in June.

The case. ﬁled by the New York State
Attorney General’s ofﬁce, was an ap-
peal of the 1984 McCurn decision which
gave students the right to register to vote
in the county in which they attend
college. : '

Albany and Ulstede Paltz) counties,
New York Public Interest Research
Group Executive director Tom Wathen
said. "Because the, state law was ruled
constitutional. every county has the
ability to stop students from registering
(at college)," he said.

NYPiRG is appealing the Attorney
General's appeal in an effort to have the
statute, which hinders student registra-
tion on campuses, declared unconstitu-
tional, Wathen said.

The dispute began when SUNYA stu—
dent Amy Aiierbach's application for
voter registraton was denied in 1980.
Wathen said. State law, at the time, left

the decision of whether students could
register to vote in their college com-
munitiesup to local Board of Elections.

After obtaining a preliminary injunc-
tion for students to register to vote at
college. the injunction was upheld in a
1984 decision by United States District
Court Judge Neal McCurn. '

Auerbach’s case was combined with a
similar case of a SUNY New Paitz stu-
dent. for which McCurn also ruled in
favor of the student, and decided the
state law was unconstitutional.

“The New York State Attorney
General's ofﬁce appealed the ruling to
defend the state law and won," Wathen
said. “The court ruled (in June 1985)
that students are a part of a transitory
population and that makes them ineligi~
ble to vote" in their college com-
munities, herald.

However. according to Nathan Riley,
a press official from the Attorney
Generals ofﬁce, the current law does
allow students to register to vote in the
communities in which they attend
school. subject to the approval of the
local Boards of Election.
