Campus women

By_ Linda Graenberg

Although organizers cannot
pinpoint a particular reason,
women’s issues seem to have
become a focus of student ac-
tivists‘as women's organizations
on campus are being reborn and
recruiting new-members.

The return of a Women’s Issues
Project at-, the SUNYA New York
Public Interest Research Group
(NYPIRG) chapter seems to be V
only the latest sign of a resurgence
of programs working for
women’s empowerment at‘ the
University. " ' ~

The Feminist Alliance, BCCOT-_
ding to chair Wendy Ce'rvi is try:
ing‘ to reach women in both the
community and on campus,
especially by striving to build-
strong relationships between l
groups such as the President’s
Task Force on Women’s'gSa ‘ t:
NYPIRG‘s Women's Issue! “03:
ject, and other campus women's “
organizations to better provide

services for women. -

Many people, Cervi said, have
a, misconception of the word
- “feminism” which leads to

misunderstandings about what

extended to incorporate the

that since the program is only in

Through the service, women can
get information about sexuality
relationships, rape, and other
subjects.

Bonnie Spanier, chair of the
Women’s Studies department,
said she believes “the interest in
women’s issues ﬂuctuates accor-
ding to the attention paid by the
University and its students." For
example, the disappearance of
Karen Wilson has brought about
an increased interest in women's
safety, she said. ‘

Due to confusion in the
scheduling of the course “in-
troduction to feminism,” the
popular class has not been offered
for the past two semesters. but
will be offered again in the spring,
Spanier said.

in the meantime, a new course
has recently been introduced into
the Women’s Studies curriculum
called the “Special Topics"
course, Spanicr said, explaining
that this semester the class is deal-
ing with current controversies on
pornography. The content of the
Special Topics course will change
to reﬂect relevent and timely
issues concerning women, she ad-
ded.
