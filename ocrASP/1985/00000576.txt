Roots of student activism p'Ian‘te-din.‘hgismr

Recently, the cries of “SUNY Divestl"
echoed across this campus. These were the
sounds of student activism — sounds that
once again are being heard on college cam-
puses across the nation.

“Students are starting to see what’s go-
ing on around them, and they are uniting
together and seeing that by doing so, they
can win.” said Student Action Committee
'Chair Larry Hartman.

“People are starting to realize how im-
portant. for example, the nuclear arms
race is,” said Hartman. “They are staring
to realize that by putting political pressure
in the proper places they can effect
change.”

“Activism is a lot more conservative in
the eighties," he added. “Students have
now learned how to work within the
system instead of against the system. in—
stead of disobedience, instead of
firebombs and instead of acts of van-
dalism, we’ve learned that we can be a lot
more effective through lobbying. petition-
ing and letter drives."

Many people view the recent resurgence
of student activism as a return to the ideals
which dominated the Sixties.

“The violent_ activism of the Sixties is
over-emphasized," said Stacey Young,
New York Public interest Research Group
(NYPlRG) Project Coordinator. “i think
there was a lot more non-violent activism
than what we hear today. WE’re better
educated now about the practicalities of
organization and there are a lot more
methods of organization and methods of
making our opinions known."

“The activism now isn’t as exciting as
the activism of the Sixties, but i think it's a
more dedicated activism." said Hartman.
“There are fewer people active now than
in the Sixties. but they know the issues very
well."

“The image we have of activists in the

Sixties is an image given to us by the
establishment media,” said Young. “Peo-
ple today have a more long range view of
things. if one thing doesn't work, we'll try
another. We won’t be as likely to resort to
desperate measures."

Young added that she felt that student
activism is here to stay. “The Sixties was
the start of it. But when the world didn't
change in a day, people got burned out.
Now i think people are going to stick with
student activism for the long haul,” she
said.

Bruce Weinfold, president of SUNYA’s
Young Republicans, said he thinks
students see themselves playing a more ac-
tive role in the system.

“People do care," he said, “and there
starting to feel they can accomplish things
when they get together on an issue. We
can't just look at problems like South
Africa,“ he added. “We also have to look
at issues around the world and in our own

country. We must examine issues rational-
ly, rather than emotionally."

“A lot of students are new to all this,"
said Tom Gaveglia, Coordinator of Peace
Project. “They're beginning to realize that

~ problems like apartheid and nuclear arms

do exist in the' world." ' .

He added “Rallies and demonstrations
give students opportunity to see that other
student, a lot of other students, feel the
same way. It's very hard to change a policy
alone. You have to work in groups.”

Complacency was easy in the seventies.
said Young,‘because it was before the con-
servative shift had really ‘set in. “Now,”
she' said, “i think the conservative shift
has clearly arrived and it is showing up in
some frightening ways. Students are begin-
ning to feel more urgent about it now than
in the seventies." ' "

Gaveglia said that he didn't feel that the

seventies were laacking in activism, but: ‘
rather that the media coverage dictated‘ '

what students were involved in. “There

was still activism here on campusjit just .

wasn't as active,” he said. “The media
didn’t play up the role of the students. . .-"

 

 

 

 

Young explained that more of today’s
libéral sttide‘nt‘ja‘ctivists are adopting dif-
ferent tactics in working, against
conservatism. .   .

“They. are not trying to‘ undo what con-

servatives do,” she said. “in a lot of ways. -

that’s good, because whenyou get'caught
up in trying to stop negative change, you
stop achieving positive change." I ' ‘
“it's hard to see where activism will go
after divestment," ‘said Hartman. “it
could be the President’s decisiontoi cut
student loans. it could be the nuclear arms
race. We act based on the consensus of the
student bddy'and what they care about."
He added that he tries to work-with as
many different groups as possible to learn
about student concerns. ' _ a '
“Students turn out in larger numbers-in
response to issues that affect them directly.

“We are at ,a turning point right now

“conservatives have always been par-

ticularly well-organized,” she added.

“Today’s activism is different,” said
Gaveglia. “Students have begun coalition
building with community members,
minority groups and especially with other _
student groups. This givs students a boost
because in unity, there is strength.” D
