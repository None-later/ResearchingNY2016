Telecommunications minor expected 

By Angellna Wang ‘ ‘

Within the next month. the Department
of Communication will propose an inter-
disciplinary minor in telecommunications
‘tentatively set to be offered in the fall
semester of 1986, according to Kathleen
Kendall. chair of the department.

This proposal has spent “over a year in
the thinking process," Kendall said, ad-
ding that it will face further reﬁnements as
it goes through the University approval
process.

Presently, the "department is talking
about putting the ﬁnishing touches on it"
even though “the idea has already been ap-
proved,” Kendall said.

Kendall defined telecommunications as
“the study of communications at a
distance." it includes telephones. com—
puters, and even satellites “which are used
to communicate very rapidly and over
great distances,” site said. Kendall said she
sees it as a national trend in communica-
tion “that has really been growing in the
past decade and will leave “impacts on
business and all of society"

The minor itself will be interdisciplinary
in nature. said Kendall. and students will
be able to choose from changes in different
departments such as Finance, Manage-
ment. Sociology. Communications.
library and information Science. and
(.‘omputer Science.

Kendall emphasized that the program is
not being offered to communications ma-

jors only, explainng that it would be a
good minor for almost arty major in the
university.

Along with the plans fora minor at the
undergraduate level, the communications
department is also discussing expanding its
master's program to include telecom-
munications. according to Richard
Drcsner. Associate Vice President for
Unversity Affairs.

knowledge, said Dresner, adding that even
in the capitol district, there exists “a non-
credit telecommunications management
program for people in state agencies or
private corporations only." '

Rapid development in our technology
has sparked interest in the telecommunica-
tions ﬁeld careerwise. according to Ken-
dall. who said “it would be a good idea to

Late buses to run

if you recently gave up waiting for a late
night bus after a night at the bars, it was a
wise move. The late night buses, sponsored
by Student Association (SA), have pot
begun running yet.

in past years. SA has provided bus ser-
vice on Friday and Saturday nights after
the University buses have stopped running.
This year the service has not started runn-
ing yet because, according to SA controller
Eric Schwartzman. “SA is still in the pro-
cess of competitive bidding with various
companies."

Schwartzman added that he hopes “ser_«
vice will begin in the next few weeks once a
contract has been signed with one of the
bus companies.“

The number of runs the buses will make
“will depend on the cost of the bus runs,"
explained Schwartzman.
