Lack otcivic responsibility.
erls student self

universities, Frank Newman, president of
the Education Commission of the States.
called on college administrators to
rededicate themselves to making sure their
institutions graduate" civic-minded
students.

College officials, Newman contended, I

are well aware of surveys indicsmg that
students today are disinterested in their
surroundings and focused (almost ex-

 

resurgence of civic education "a sizeable'

task" facing educators. ,_

“The college experience should develop
within each student a sense of countryand
community service, and a desire to help

funding.

Newman’s white paper “sets the agenda
for a vigorous new debate about the
federal government’s relationship" to
higher education, Carnegie Foundation
President Ernest Boyer proclaimed.

“Students too frequently sit passively in
class, take safe courses, are discouraged
from risky or interdisciplinary research
projects, and from challenging ideas
presented to them." Newman wrote.

“Students must be willing to recognize
that learning is more than preparation for
