Running in a pack sparks barriers tovictory I

By Dave Blette
STAFF WRITER

The Albany State men’s cross country
team put three more marks in the win col-
umn last week. ‘

The harriers narrowly edged Divisionl
Colgate 25-34 on Saturday, September
28th and defeated both North Adams and
SUNY New Paltz on Wednesday, October
2nd. The harriers currently have a record
of l0—4. Facing their fifth Division I oppo-
nent this season, the barriers were wary 'of
the home meet against Colgate. Their fears
were almost confirmed.

Just past the middle of the race, Col-
gate's top two men opened up a gap on
Albany that was not to be relinquished, as
they took the ﬁrst two spots at the ﬁnish.
Behind these two men was a pack of
Albany runners and the key to the race,
Colgate’s third man. Sophomore Pat Paul
commented on the race.

“Without a doubt this was our closest
meet this year, said Paul. “We almost got
shut out if you think about it. If Colgate’s
third man had run about 20 seconds faster
we would have lost."

The race’s turning point came past the
three mile point when the Albany pack
started to move on the Colgate man.
Observing the race at this point was assis—
tant coach Chuck Racey.

“Three guys: Jack Glaser. Tim Hoff
and Trcuer Hash were running as a group
and they just blew by the third Colgate
guy."

As the race came near the ﬁnish Albany
had their first five men in front of Col-
gate's third man. Leading the pack was co-
captain Craig Parlato, who took third with
a time of 27:20. Four seconds behind him
was “Runner of the Meet” Hoff, who is
coming back strong from an early season
illness. Next in a tight pack came Glaser at
27:30.l, Hash at 27:30.3, and Kevin
Shechan at 27:32.

Adding even more excitement to the
finish was freshman Yemon Miller, who
took eighth.

“Vernon ﬂew down the last hill and
outkicked the Colgate guy. I’m really im-
pressed with the way the team is running as
a strong pack," commented Coach Racey.

This pack running ability of Albany
State can be seen in this fact: this was the
second week in a row that Albany was able

to put together a solid group of six rumters
in the top nine against Division I teams.
The time spread between Albany's ﬁrst
and sixth man was an incredibly low 17.5
seconds. '

- Although the victory was a good one,
the ﬁnishing times seemed slow compared
to past meets with Colgate. When asked
about this, ' barrier Chuck Brenner
responded; “Those guys were ﬁghting off

the wind like crazy. That can take 20
seconds off your time?I ‘ .

(Last Wednesday, the barriers traveled to
Massacheusetts to face two smaller Divi-
sion Ill schools: North Adams and New
Paltz'. Albany came out on top, shutting
out both teams witha'score of 15-50.

Running on an extremely hilly course,

Things are not running as smoothly as
hoped, no pun intended, for the Albany
State women’s cross country team. With
a near—full squad returning after the
I984 team earned a berth to the NCAA
Division III Nationals, it is deﬁnitely
not a smooth ride.

Saturday, the Danes placed sixth in
the LeMoyne Invitational held in
Syracuse. Powerful Ithaca, which looks
to be among the top Division III con-
tenders in the nation this year, won the
meet with 29 points, according to Head
Cross Country Coach Ron White. Last
year Albany placed second in the
Invitational.

Sophomore Kim Pettichord led the
scoring for the Lady Danes with a 15th
place ﬁnish over the challenging 3-mile
course. Petticherd's 19:28 was quite
respectable considering the muddy and
very hilly course.

She said “I felt conﬁdent wearing
spikes but I was really scared when we
hit that narrow turn. nothing mattered
then." Pettichord spoke in reference to
a sharp hairpin turn on a major

 

Women runners take sixth place

downhill which caused several com-
petitors in the meet‘to fall down on the
muddy terrain.

Running second for Albany was '00-
captain Karen DeFeo.‘ DeFeo ﬁrmly
stated that “the course's tight turns

. were hazardous to the competitors.”

Senior Lynn Jacobs trailed DeFeo by
l4 seconds to place 23rd. Rounding out
the top ﬁve scoring for Albany were
junior Kitty Sullivan and senior Chris
Varley placing 50th "and 58th
respectively.

Also running for Albany were team
members Roseanne Smith, Jennifer
Corby, Brendan Watson, Mary Lou
Webster, Sue Gulla, Carol Bart, and
Jackie Phipps.

“Anticipation” was a key word in
categorizing this meet before the race in
terms of its unpredictable outcome, and
the sloppy course, according to
Sullivan. The challenge here was to
finish without falling.

The LeMoyne Invitational marked
the first meet in which many of the
teams in Albany’s region came together
to compete. Up until now teams really
only knew about each other through

paper results and word of mouth.‘
However, this meet has shown which
teams may in the future constitute
' forces to bereckoned with.

However this meet has shown which
teams may  the. future. consititute
.forces’ to be"re’ckoned with.

' Fortunately'the Albany team has lots
of depth and has run quite respectany
so far this season. However the DAnes
have not had a 100 percent performance
this year. Meet after meet runners are
continuing to baattle injuries. Albany’s
performance at LeMoyne cannot be
called a true indicator of the teams
potential. Seniors Donna Burnham,
Bette Dzamba and Sue Spector remain
injured along with juniors and
sophomores Carla Docharty, Marla
Mahon, and Rachel Braslow.

White remains optimistic. He hopes
to have most of his forces in action next
Saturday. The Capitol District Meet
which includes most local college teams
from the capitol district area will be run
at home Saturday. Perhaps the Capitol
District Meet will test the real depth of
the Albany team. Cl

Netwomen. boast 5-2 record

By Marc Barman
SPORTSEDITDR .

[You could tellrby hearing Linda Myer’s
voice that the Albany State women's tennis
team has gone through a busy four-day
stretch. ' . g

The Albany State_,coach.,sporting at
hoarse throat after spending three of the
past four afternoons yelling instructions

. from the sidelines, saw, her Danes improve

its SUNYAC record to 4-0 and their

overall clip to 5-2.

The Danes tw'o victories came against
Potsdam and RPI, but the squad fell to St.
Lawrence in that four day stretch.

Saturday was the day the Danes

humiliated Potsdam, 8-1. The Bears might

have a fOrmidable basketball program. but
tennis is a different story. “We should've
won all the matches,” strained Myers. In
fact. the Danes have blanked Potsdam for
the past three seasons.

On Friday, the Danes'came close to a
school they usually are outclassed by. Los-
ing 5—4 to St. Lawrence was a big con-
ﬁdence booster for the Danes, who were
blanked by the upstate school 9-0 in 1984.

The deciding match occurred at third
doubles, where co-captains Nancy Forbes
and Nina Cheung fell to pieces in the third
and deciding set. The Albany duo took a
2-0 lead, but failed to muster a game after

'that. Cheung’s serve became erratic as she

double faulted three straight times in the
third game. From there. the St.
Lawrence‘s Wendy Poole and Rachel Gilet
reeled off ﬁve straight games to win the
match and the meet. Yesterday, the
Danes beat RPI, 5-2. Geri Chiodo, at
number one singles, beat Laurie Com-
struck, 60, 7-5.

. This week, the Danes 'play Skidmore on

Wednesday and the mighty Binghamton
Colonials on Friday. Binghamton, winners
of the SUNYAC conference for the past
few years. are heavily favored to beat the
Danes. _

“I hate‘to say that our chances aren’t
that good,” said Myers, “but you got to
be realistic. We're going to have to play
our best and that might not be enough.
Binghamtonisthat good.” _ Cl
