SUNYA frets resurrecting despite  trend"

While relations between university of-
ﬁcials andcfraternities and sororities on
some campuses have soured, the resurrec-
tion of “greek” life at SUNYA has hap
pened quickly and proven popular with
students. .

“i think the response of the University
has been a very positive and supportive
one," said Vice President for Student Af-
fairs Frank Pogue.

“The University is very supportive and
pleased to see the growth of sororities and
fraternities,” echoed Director of Student
Activities Jessica Casey.

While greek-administrastion relations
within SUNY have been platonic, such is
not the case at other schools. Even more
striking, however. is the rapid growth of
greek organizations on the SUNYA cam-
pus. While there were only a handful of
such organizations here just a year ago.
there are at least 15 fraternities and 7
sororities recognized by the University, aC<
cording to Casey.

Why did greek life emerge so suddenly
and quickly at SUNYA?

“Nobody knows why,” said Casey.
"supposedly students are more traditional
and conservative."

Andrea Hanan President of Psi Gamma
disagreed asserting, “We‘re not conscr-
vative, each one of u: is very different.”

“We have some guys who are jocks,"
said Michael Liebowitz president of Phi
Lambda Phi. “and some guys who
smoke.”

“Students‘ values are changing." said
William Murabito, SUNY Central’s Assis-
tant Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs.
“i think students are shown nationally to
be more conservative.”

"Students...need something to identify
with" and it is often difficult to identify
with a campus, he stated. “it's easy to
identify with a fraternity, sorority or a

club.”

“People in frats are insecure, they need
frats to carry them through the everyday
problems of life," claimed Tim Cochise, a
junior, who does not belong to a
fraternity.

Greek leaders tended to agree with the
positive assessments of greek-
administration relations made by Pogue
and Casey.

“My fraternity hasn't had any distinct
problems that i could point out with the
administration," said Liebowitz. although
he did say that the administration
sometimes blames an entire fraternity for
the misdeeds of one of its members.

Hanan said. “They (university ofﬁcials)

.weren’t really prepared for” greek growth,

but other than a “big communication prb—
blem" that has caused some groups to miSs
intra-fraternity meetings, Hanan had no
other complaints.

Casey admitted to having trouble in sen-
ding out notices about meetings to the
groups but said she hoped to solve that

'problem by depending more on telephone

calls than on on-campus mail.

There has been a “signiﬁcant increase in
interest" in fraternities and sororities on
other SUNY campuses, according to
Murabito.

Though “some (administrations) are
leery because of problems before,"
Murabito said, they “are quite willing to
work with” sororities and fraternities.’

All SUNYA-recognized fraternities and
sororities must sign non-discrimination
and non-hazing statements, Casey said.

Casey objected to the use of the term
“little sisters” for the female auxiliaries of
some fraternities. “i wish they would refer
to them as ‘women,’ ” she said, “l’m not
seeing as many references to ‘women’ as i
would like."

According to Howie‘ Sonnenschein.‘

president of Zeta Beta Tau, the members

of ZBT “develop close relations with the .

girls" who are their little sisters “just like
you would if you had a sister at home.”

An issue of particular concern to some
fraternities and sororities is housing.
Prevented from forming off-campus
“frat-houses” by the City of Albany‘s
grouper law which- prevents more than
three unrelated persons from living in‘the
same rental unit, some view on-campus
housing as their only alternative.

"We need a house," said Sonnenschein,

“as house builds unity and unity builds '

brotherhood." 4

Because many fraternities and sororities“
formed late last semester, they were unable
to apply for—“special interest housing” but
this year, according to . Director of

' the (fall) semester:

Will fraternities and sororities continue 
to grow? " 'l v»

"it’s tough to tell," said Casey, “some,
people say we might be at our limit." '.

“SUNY-Albany is on a lot of (frater-

our size and prestige many national greek
organizations want to establish chapters
here," claimed Casey. ‘ » 7 Cl

Waterville. Maine
COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE —— Last year,
the commission appointed by trustees of
Colby College in Maine to review pro-
blems with the school’s ll fraternities
and sororities adopted a, recommenda-
tion no one had anticipated: withdraw
recognition for all greek organizations.
And this fall. the college has opened
for the first time without greeks on
campus.

“We had tried creating new standards V

for them two years earlier," said ad-
ministrator Earl Smith. “They had an
impact in some cases, but they didn't
have much of an impact overall."
Amherst College in Massachusetts
soon followed Colby’s lead. But even
schools that didn‘t go as far are spen-
ding this fall giving greek organizations
unprecedented nationwide scrutiny.
There is nothing new about
disciplinary sanctions against individual
greek chapters, but even national greek

 

leaders acknowledgerthe heat ‘is on as .
never before. ' , ‘
Already this fall, ofﬁcials at Florida,
Duke, Lehigh, and Dartmouth have in-
.vestigated and ﬁled charges against
some of their fraternities. in addition,
Loyola-New Orleans administrators say
they will soon bring criminal charges

against two former frat members.

“We're under attack," said Mark
Mullinix of Alpha Tau Omega's na-
tional organization.

“There is an increasing public outcry
fueled by dramatic storiesof miscon-
duct, much of it relating to the way
women are treated by frater-
nities,”Mullinix said.

Apart from the ongoing disciplinary
measures on many different campuses.
some unusual punishments are being
imposed:
