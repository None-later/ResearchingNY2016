Within SUNYA's music
department hides 'a man of many
talents. Professor Roy Rettig.
who teaches the jazz improvisa-
tion class and directs the Universi-
ty Jazz Ensemble is. like many
professors in

the department 

only a part-time
“Hi” Profile
member.

Rettig was
not even interested in music until
he was l8. At that time he had
broken his arm playing baseball
and to kill time he just started
banging away on a piano. “I real-
ly loved it and ever since then I've
wanted to play," he said.

Rettig had not done well in
school as a child. but he
graduated from the Buhlee
School of Music in Boston in I976
with honors. “I really enjoyed
what I was learning so I did
well." recalled Rettig. It was
quite an accomplishment since
only 107 of the students
graduated. Most of the students
got picked up by a band. but this
couldn’t happen to me since I
enrolled knowing nothing about
music."Rettig humorously
added.

After graduation. Rettig played
for agysaLWith a disco band in
order to save money and travel.
He spent approximately a year in
India and Napal. Since then he
has spent his time in Albany play-
ing gigs, perfecting his trade and
making a reputation for himself.

Presently. Rettig plays with two
bands. the main one being
“George Mastrangelo and

Friends.” The other band,
"Wolfgang and the Demons.”
was recently reorganized into
“Fried Eggs. " due to the fact that
the original saxophone player left
for a gig in Aruba.

“Fried Eggs" plays a great deal
of original music. “Our music is
hard to describe. It's like a mix
between Hendrix and Steely
Dan."explained Rettig. The band
plays locally at places like

Saratoga and in Lake George, he

' said.

Aside from doing three to four

~ gigs a week, Rettig is involved in

programming for commercial
jingles. songwriting and recor-
ding. An album. which he cut
with guitarist Kevin McNeal, call-
ed Greene Blues features their
original works and will be releas-

ed within the month. He has
made several television ap-
pearances on shows like The
Mad, Mad World of Art. In addi-
tion, his videotape from the
Delmar Library will be featured
on television some time this
month.

Rettig spends a great deal of
time at recording studios.
especially his own,‘ Cotton Hill
'Recording. "I use the studio
primarily as a scratch pad for
myself, although I occasionally
art demos for other people,”ex-
plained Rettig. He recently cut six
children’s songs for a client with a
synthesizer. . a.

Adirondack Studies is another
major focal point of Rettig’s life.
He works therewith three other
musicians; the owner of the
Studio. Ace Parkhurst, a recor-
ding engineer; Chuck D'Alia, a
guitarist; and Peter Borras, a
drummer .from the band
"Downtime." The group has
recently submitted two of
Parkhurst’s songs to Tree
Publishing and they may be used
for a Nashville music special. The
group may be called ‘PARC' for
each of their initials, but nothing
definite has been decide. “We
thought of calling it ‘CRAP' but I
don’t think it would go over as
well." joked Rettig. “We're hop-
ing to get our foot in the door and
be able to submit more material,”
he said. ” ’

Rettig has also worked with
varidus singers and dancers as an
accompianist. Jody Shane, the
Theresa Broadwell Quartet and
various dance troups from New
York are among a few of-‘the
groups he has played for. - ‘

When asked about life as a
musician. Rettig saidu T‘Don’t get
involved if you’re only doing it on
a monetary basis. The competi-
tion is stiff. the hours are-long
and the environment‘is :lousy. "

Rettig pointed out that gigs can
become monotonous when they
have to be done for a living.-
especially» since inﬂation has
bypassed musicians.” ._I 'get an‘
average of $30 a night. that‘s;
$4.00 an hour. I was making that
kind of money five years ago."ex-
claimed Rettig. This also explains
why he had to paint houses to
suppliment his income in the past.

Being a musician also puts
massive restraints on his social
life. said Rettig. “My wife and I
work at our realtionshlp, in fact
sometimes we book time together,-
otherwise I'd never get to see
her,"said ‘Rettig. “There are
times when I work six shows per
weekend." he added. ‘

Rettig said he is working on
music as a craft and trade instead
of as an idea or art form. This
said Rettig, is the key to being
successful. “We can play
anything well. we even play a
mean polka," he said. adding
that an instrument is merely an
extension of one’s self. You have
to understand it technically and
mentally." he said.

Rettig’s goals are to be suc-
cessful, make money. gains
recognition and feel good. .

“I'm tall arid weird looking. I‘
could put a streak‘ln my hair and.
beads in my beard and fit right in:
on MTV,‘ but that's not what it’s?
all about. I like to play music.
that‘s sincere with good players,’f_
he said. ‘ ”“ Ei‘
