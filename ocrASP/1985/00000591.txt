Following. State Univ'grsity'of New York
policy. ﬁlm's-Implementation of 21 " corn-
mitten-has been conducting closed
meetings’after having decided by majority
vote that members of the press may not
attend. ‘ T ‘ ' ‘
The committee, a- Vice-President for
Student Affairs .Task Force designed to
make a recommendation to University of-_
ficials concerning the 21-year-old
minimum purchase age, for alcohol.

terminally-implemented a closed meeting

policy sixth;  f , g of the semester and
reaffirmed that [policy at] its Octdber' 3
meeting. at which time Albany Student
Press (ASP) :Editor-in-Chief Heidi .i
Grails requested admittance. ‘ "

“‘lt has been a University policy for a
number of years to close task force
meetings when :they (the administration)
feel the situation warrants it.” Gralla said.

in the fall‘of 1983, the Presidential Task
Force on bus fee altemativcs-and the Vice
President for Student Affairs' ’Alcoho'l
Policy Task Forcethad both closed their
meetings. she explained. - . ‘

 to 'tlib committecchsir James
Doellefeld, Director of Campus Life, task
force meetings are not subject to the Open
Meetings Law or the lireedom of Infome-
tlon Act because-the task force is designed
only to, recommend policy. not change
policy. T‘ ‘ I ~ - I

When melded why the committee,

meetings‘7are not open to the press. -

' ' Doellcfeld responded. that ""The im-

plemcntation of 21’ committee has no-pro-
blern with discussing With the press the
issues, that are under discussion.

(However) the committee Wishes 'not’to‘ ',

have reported infncws articles speciﬁc

quotadons‘or attributions reflecting what '

individual committee members say when.
we'discuss mistrial”, ' "‘ "-1

' (The - University‘ is following policy that ,.
this originallyappliefd in October 1983,

.-whcn theorizinal Alcohol Policy 

Forcewas convened." .,
 “when thefalc'ohol committee met me ~
years’ago‘ and some attempt was made (by:
theiASP to‘gain access to the meeting), we
naturally had dreading of that law by our
ovin attorney," Vice-President for Student
Affairs. Frank Po‘gue, said. _

The ASP has considered discussing the
issue with individual committee members,
but has decided to wait for the response to
letters requesting an official statement of ’
policy from SUNYA's Ofﬁce of the
University Council, Grails said. “Then '
we’ll either approach members or consider
legal action.!’she said. ‘ - .

The committee would reconsider allow-
ing the press to attend if the request is
made before a meeting. Doellefcld said.

Once informed of this. Grails said the
ASP will approach committee members
and attempt to sway majority opinion on
the board. “Wewouid go'back. as often as .
he (Doellefeld) is willing to put this-up for
a vote, we’ll be. there,” she said.~ » I

SCA TE ’5 $8,000 budget to

be need by (new SA exec

‘  Angelina Wane

in reéponse to a cry for help from the .

Student Association Test Bank and the

Student Course; and-Teacher Evaluation -

(SCATE) program. Central Council pass-
‘ed a bill called the Education Act of 1985
at their Wednesday night meeting.

This bill establiShcd tin-Educational At: "'

fairs Commissioner who would be a part
of the executive branch of. SA for all
academic and educational affairs. ‘

The duties of theEducational Affairs 4

Commissioner..arevto help run the Test
Bank, and to help administer the 'SCATE’
program batted upon guidelines set by the .
Academic'Affairs Committee. .. ’

“This is a major policy for Central
Council," said chair Bill McCann, in his
introductory remarks; All the members of
the Council agreed on the importance of
the issue of education. , '

“Academics is why .we  all here,"
said Michelle Legendre, Academic Affairs
Committee chair. “This bill will show that
Central..Council-.is interested in academic
affairs."addcd‘Stcven Russo,-Internal_Af-
fairs Committee chair. , ‘

The bill that internal Affairs initially in-
troduced called for the establishment of an
Educational Affairs agency Which would

be governed by a Board of Directors. The. _'

board would have consisted  the voting
members of the Academic Affairs Com—
mittee. the Central Council chair. and the
Commissioner of Educational Affairs.

A great deal of opposition was voiced
toward this idea by SA President Steve

Gawley, who said. "We‘re not going _

about it the right'way. I don’t think a com-
missionTs‘thc answer. We need individuals
in there to do the work."

Mark Rivers concurred by saying there
is “no need to create more bureaucracy."
Council Member Greg Rothschild added.
“It would become a horrible precedent If
we create a'ncw commission under Central '
Council. It will become our. ultimate
responsibility? 1 think the Executive
Branch 1: the place to straighten it out
because they have the resources?

The Educational Affairs Director will-be

an Executive Branch service" po’sitiorinand J

should besccountable to the‘Bxecutive
Branch.” said Cowley. The Educational.
Affairs Commissioner will also-free the
Academic» Affairs, Committee to be
creative and initiate policy. added Russo.

' The problbms surrounding the SA Test
Bank and ‘SCATE’ ,date back to last spr-
ing when the Executive Branch budgeted a

~~$500 stipend for an Educational Affairs 

Director. but "Steve Gawlcy decided.th
to fill the"position,”'according toRusso.

“‘The only reason why we want: to pass it
(the bill) tonight is because of thc‘problcms
of SCATE,” said Russo. SCATB has a
budget of $8000 appropriated by SA that Is
not being used," he added.

Legendre said she did not think the Test
Bank would open on time. but said. "let’s
open with what we have. One hundred
tests are better than none." According to
Legendre the Academic Affairs Commit-
tee spent about 150 hours cleaning and
typing the exams. She agreed that the Test
Bank needed supervision rather than
volunteers. ‘7'”

"I think we worked out an excellent
compromise here.” he added. The meeting,
was “a total victory for Internal Affairs
and Central Council. The compromise: .

‘rnagle will make everything smoother."
