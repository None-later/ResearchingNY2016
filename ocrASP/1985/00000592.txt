Hearing examines SA election turnout,“funds

By Jeffrey Roosa I
Student Association (SA) elec-

tions need to be better publicized

and possibly publicly ﬁnanced

was the consensus of those testify- _

ing at a hearing held Tuesday in-
vestigating SA elections policy.

The hearing was convened by
the Investigations Oversight and
Analysis Committee, a subcom—
mittee of Central Council Internal
Affairs Committee.

On the issue of possibly

limiting the number of posters
and flyers per candidate SA Presi-
dent Steve Gawley said, “You
can’t limit it too much. People
who aren't well known won’t
have the same chance to raise to
high levels.

“Groups come ﬁrst as far as
poster space goes,” said Gawley,
adding. “We should keep quad
elections on the quad.”

SA Vice-President Ross

biggest problem, 40 percent
would be a good turnout." He
added that. ‘ ‘You must let people
know about the election
committee.”‘

Doug Tuttle, SA Media Direc-
tor agreed and suggested a Can-
didates Forum, to which he ads
ded,“l.eaders must arise in a wor-
thy way.”

Tuttle also said that "these are
important positions,” and that
“winning is more than just the
number of posters you hang. You
should drastically limit the
number of posters.” As alter-
natives, Tuttle suggested “throw
a keg party" or “have the can-
didates go door to door."

Voter turnout was also an issue
at the hearing. Doug Tuttle said
“increasing turnout should be a
priority."

dinator Paco Duarte responded

itself.” He felt that two days
wasn’t a long enough polling
period. , .

“Let the (Student) Voice cover
the debates and candidates
moves. Keep it fair., Publicize

who are the candidates,” said'

Gawley.

On the topic of campus
debates, Mike Miller, committee
member, said that “Quad debates

. must end." ..

On the issue of Financing Com-
mittee, member'Steve Russo ask-
ed Gawley, “How much did you
spend on your campaign? Do you
think that's a good amount for a
candidate to spend?”

Gawley replied that he had
spent “around $400” and he add-
ed that it was “a good amount. I
pay for most of my school, and I
borrowed most of the money. I
think SA campaigns should be

subsidized.” Gawley said he felt

 

 

Bill McClmu, Central Council
chair, said, “I don’t think we
should subsidize elections."

“I probably spent $700 on my
campaign." said Milieu “I had to
because the next guy did, and I
think Steve must have spent more
than he' realizes.” Miller 3' sug-
gested that “Maybe SA reim-
bursement is necessary to serious
candidates.” . .

Miller commented on the
Albany Student Press coverage of
the election by saying that the
first coverage of the election was
in the endorsement issue.

ASP Editor-in-Chief Heidi.
Gralla replied, “By the time we
got the names of thecandidates it
was too late to do introductions.
and we like to wait until nomina-
tions are closed before we do
anything.” She said candidates

Buddhist tells of life’s essence.

By Davld L.L. Laskln
CONTRIBUTING EDITOR
What you see is not what you get.
That message came from a Tibetan Buddhist his

eminence Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche. speaking in -

the Performing Arts Center Monday night. Rin-
poche. one of the four holders of the Kagyu lineage
of Tibetan Buddhism, spoke on “Awakened Heart-
Brilliant Mind." .

Rinpoche prefaced his lecture by explaining that
“though from the conventional point of view Bud-
dhism is a major religious tradition founded in the
East that doesn't make it something eastern or

oriental...Ralizing our most basic spiritual qualities.
is not merely something eastern or oriental.” he _

said. ' ‘

Speaking through a translator from‘the Kagyu
monestary in Woodstock, New York, Rihpoche ex-
plained, “Buddhism addresses basic and fun-
damental truths of both phenomenal'world and our
inner individual situation; .it is not a rigid set of

beliefs and customs designed for a particular group-w“

or locality."

Growing increasingly animated as he spokeH Rin-
poche continued, “There are two ways we relate to
the world: first,4what we perceive it as; and second,

what the phenomenal world is, fundamentally and ‘
ultimately. Most of the time, ourrelatiOnshlp wrth ‘

the world is not through its basic nature but
through our perceptionstof it. So we don’t ex-
perience what we are fundamentally or. what the
world is fundamentally. but what we see, which
isn‘t in accordance with our basic nature."

This, Rinpoche explained, is where a person's
anxieties are based. Trusting our perceptins as the
basis for experiencing reality “produces dissatisfac-
tion, a Very huge gap. We feel that something is
missing and no matter what we do the scale of
dissatisfaction increases, because we act in accor-

dance with our clinging acceptance of what we see
as being fundamentally true,” he said. '

“That is why," he said, “our lives seem very
much like a joke — like each of us are a big impor-
tant leader in name with no power at all and no idea
of what's happening. What we have is a big name,
‘l.’ But it is all parrotting: there’sno sense of being
alive or being present. The habltof observation.
distraction and confusion has madntpuppets of us
—— machines being operated from behind.“ said
Rinpoche. _. . 3, f x, -'

Buddhism, explained Rinpoche,'offers. a way to
break this cycle of illusion and suffering.“ The,
Tibetan word for buddhism hasthe meaning inter-
nalizing, or internalistic, that one needs to turn in-
wardly and work with oneself, developing a better
sense of who you are, and through that, of the "
world,” he said.  a -

Achieving What the Buddhists call mindfulness,
thrugh meditative practice, is the path that will lead
one.eback to the fundamental and ultimate ex-
perience of reality, claimed Rinpoche. “When you
have proper mindfulness — an alert. fresh. att'en-
tive mind —- you have a sense-of potiver knowing V
what's really happening around you and inside
you," he said. ' .»j ' i

“What is necessary to have a healthy basis for the
experience of one’s life," Rinpoche emphaslzzed,
“is an understanding that dissatisfaction and con-
fusion are‘not from the outside. but an expression
of the habit of our mind that we’ve become add-
dicted to. we haven't recognized the inheritance of
our own richness, but through hibitual clinging we
hafegone against what we are and what we have.

Before closing, Rinpoche told his audience that
“Buddhism is universal, based on the common
sense of what is. who we are and what the world
is..| . I

SUNYA Central has advised
SUNYA’s personnel office not to
issue graduate students who teach
faculty or staff l.D. cards,
especially while PERB's decision
on whether such people are state
employees is still pending. Public
Safety will not issue a faculty or
staff parking sticker without a

faculty or staff l.D. said
Henderson.
"It’s the State University’s

position that they are not facul-
ty—-—they are primarily students."
said University Personnel
Associate Rod Mason.

“The Personnel Office is not
denying them parking permits.”
said Mason. adding, "If Public
Safety wanted to they could have
a system to allow graduate
employees faculty parking
privileges."

“We'd be glad to verify to
Public Safety that they are grad
assistants," stated Mason. “It's
sort of like the tail wagging the
dog, this is Public Safety's bag."

“Just by virtue of they're being
graduate assistants doesn’t mean
they get faculty or staff stickers."
said University Parking Ad-
ministrator Lloyd Hebert.

Faculty l.D.‘s are needed to
obtain staff parking permits. said
Hebert. and Personnel is “The
only one that can issue it."

SUNYA, according to Hender-
son. does not want to admit that
ta's are staff because of the full
ramifications that would have.
The (SUNYA) catalog lists me as
staff," said Henderson. “That's
why I’m standing in front of the
class teaching," he added. Thirty-
five courses are taught by
graduate students who the‘unlver-

sity do not consider faculty or
staff, he said.

The United University Profes-
sions (UUP) had issued a letter to
graduate students expressing its
desire to represent them.

The Communication Workers
of America (CWA) which
represents telephone operators
and linemen has funded the
GSEU during the last two years
since, as an unofficial union
because the GSEU is unable to
collect dues. Most of the money
went into an effort to have one
third of working grad students
state wide fill out interest cards.

“Locally we received our sup-
port with mlnimal effort," said
Henderson. “it wasn’t difficult to
get grad students interested in a
union. They‘re npt stupid; they
understand that as a collective
voice they will have more
strength," he added. [I

Wednesday night in-'the Assembly Hall
with. an apology, claiming that. “the
advertisement was cleverly and shrewdly
ambiguous” in hinting at the n'a'ture'ofhis
speech. It implied' that he would' say
something "“everyone would ‘want to
hear." ' ' “

_ Howe‘s audience, however, wasyv‘not
disappointed. The majority of the approx-
imately 100' people who came to see him
speak were members of the Albany com-
munityrand ‘SUN'YAfaculty who were
familiar With his work. '

~ Historically, socialism hasn't'succeeded
in the United States as it has in Europe,

said Howe. due to the fact that Arnerica'

has had a different history. Socialism ad
been ineffective during the labor
movements of the late 19th and early 20 th
centuries, and it failed to become a‘ uniﬁed
movement, he added.

Part of the problem was the huge influx
of European immigrantsto this country,
said Howe,'adding that there were many
different ethnic cultures. “People concen-
trated to‘ethnic neighborhoods, bothout
of fear and to live ‘with people who spoke
their own'lang'uage,” he said. This worked
against the development of any concerted
labor movement, he stated. ‘

“Divisiveness doesn’t tell us enough
about the problems of socialsim," Howe
continued. Another problem was the

3m the 1960’s that any institution has
taken such action. ‘ "

“American myth.” “America was truly ‘
seen as the land of opportunity,” he said.

-- “Many felt that if'they accepted depriva-

tion for the short term, their life would be
better, or at least that of their children,”
said Howe; ‘ ‘ .

One of these deprivations was that,
“American businessmen often used brutal
methods to break strikes," said Howe, ad-v
ding that this didn’t’happen in England.
“This was another factor limiting the
desire to become socialist. ‘ ,

America "was seen as an open society as?
compared to autocracy." said Howe. Peo-
ple were essentially happy with their lot, he
added. ‘ \

ing that abusive behavior at fraternities
had become an epidemic. ‘
— Dozens of schools have adopted
tougher disciplinary regulations.
Florida, for one, recently decided to re
quire all fraternities to hire security
guards for parties.

Hamilton, Colgate.

The nature of the American political
system didn’t help the Socialist cause, said
Howe. “Our system combines rigidity in

‘ structure with ﬂexibility in parties. The

two party system makes it very difficult for
a third party to' get on the ballot, and
bargaining within the parties blurs
ideology." ’

Though getting on the ballot would have
proved helpful,- sectorianism‘ caused
socialist leaders to “almost religiously sup-
port their own candidates rather than
anyone else on the ballot no matter how
liberal," said Howe.

This was compounded by the fact that

schools — are under pressure either to
bolish all fraternities or implement
reforms. National fraternity leaders
complain they want to solve the pro-
blems, but don't want to lend credence
towhat they say is an unfair emphaiss
on problems not unique to the greek «
system.

Said the ATO’s Mullinix: “There is

people like to vote for who will win. Howe
said, adding that. “it is terrible for an
American to always be in a losing party.”
But, said Howe, “It is better to vote for
what you want and lose than to vote for
what you don’t want and win."

Responding to a question on American’s
voting on their pocketbooks, Howe
answered, “If Americans voted on their
pocketbooks, Reagan wouldn’t have
won.”

Howe said he felt that “trade unions
shold be defended,'for all their flaws, from
what they are up against." adding that
“labor sparring and scabbing still goes
on.” Howe asserted that it is important to
“realize what labor unions have done for
workers, particularly auto workers."

Howe's presentation was sponsored by
the local Albany chapter of U.U.P.(United
University Professors). the SUNY staff

'and faculty union. U.U.P. represents

17,000 SUNY employees. SUNYA pro-
fessor Jim Reilly, President of the Albany
chapter‘and chief negotiator, said that
Howe was brought here because he
“represents the excellence of a faculty
member. He's a model."

Howe is a professor at City University
of New York (CUNY) and is the author of
more than 12 books, including the best-
selling World of Our Fathers. He is also
the editor of Dissent magazine and a
member of the Democratic Socialists of
America Executive Committee. [3

community that we cannot sustain the
level of legitimate criticism we're
getting."

“They‘re not focusing on the broader
picture that includes the fact that frater-
nities and sororities accomplish many
worthwhile things."
