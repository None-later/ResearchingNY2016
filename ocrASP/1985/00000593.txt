sonal testimony on respdnsibie drinking.
He was referred to Judicial Board for
disorderly conduct after becoming drunk
and trying to punch a policeman. He told
the audience that. “l was described as the
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde syndrOme: calm
and polite when sober. but violent when
drunk.”' ' . ." 1 J

He 'asked, “Would you punch a
policeman" knowing that it's against the
law and he’slcarr'yin'g a gun?‘ Well, when‘
you’re drunk, you don’t even know or care
what you’re doing. You can‘t even control
yourself.’f.Covielli got a round of ap-
plause for his honesty. .

Education was another much-discussed
topic of conversation at the meeting. SA
President Steve Gawley stressed the need
for alcohol education. “SA is committed
to having non-alcoholic programs on cam-
pus." he said.

SA Minority Affairs Coordinator Paco
Duarte said he felt that alcohol should not
be banned from campus because “it will

hinderinitial development. It is dangerous A

not to allow students to drink on campus.
This is where students learn to handle
alcohol and learn their tolerances." _

Duane added that, “students should ex-
perience alcohol on campus where it can be
part of their education. Here. there are
counselors at Middle Earth and other ser-
vices that can teach students about it.
whereas later in life, it will be more
dangerous where there is not help readily
available."

Student Chris Dillan added that,-

“drinking is part of the socialization pro-
cess in college." .

Students' rights were another issue that
was brought up. “Students may vote.
marry, and fight in a war at age 18. but not
drink until they are 21. Does that make
sense?" said Zellan, adding, “In the
Federal court case, Bradshaw vs. Raw!-
ings. the role of “in loco parentus" was
not valid anymore. the administration
should not act “in place of parents; rather,

and students have a right to their own
privacy." lf alcohol is forbidden on cam-

pus altogether, “Why should; someone on .
' campus have different rights than someone

off-camjiusf ’ it‘ .. they " arefold‘ enough to
drink?’   g  ﬁj- :

Larry Hartman, chair'of SA's Student
Action Committee added that “a self-
sufﬁciency- plan, in which students would

’have a landlord-tenant relationship with

the University, would not permit universi-
ty . officials to e'nte'r students’ rooms
without pemtission."   ' .

Possible results of the implementation
of “21" were mentioned. According to
Carol Slinger,, Area Coordinator for
Alumni Quad,'the University will “focus
on the issue of multiple containers, such as
kegs or beer bails, Given the small percen-
tage of students who will be old enough to
drink, about 15 percent. large amounts of
alcohol won’t be necessary." L

Chris Hazzard. Residence Director on
Dutch Quad, said "‘t'o maybe make some
areas of the quads ‘wet areas.’ such as the
U-lounges.” She also added that “Resi-
dent Directorsdo have access to the bir-
thdates of students. so they know who will
be underage and who will not."

SA Controller Eric Schwartzman said he
feelsthat “seniors pay 25 percent of the
mandatory student fee in the school. Most
seniors will be 21 by‘Dece‘rnber 11 Those
.students who are old enough should be
allowed to congregate where’they want.

Apprimately 30 peeople spoke regarding
the issue of the 2]~year-old purchasing

hour and a half. concluded with Phil Bot-

Serums. tradition and backs abound on

' the Albany State rugby team. currently 2-2,

going into Saturday’s home gameth
Union. However, according to team Presi-
dent Pat Corigan, in this game of elegant
violence. there are no freaksi

“There’s a lot of strategy ' ' ‘ in
this game,” said Corigan, “which makes it
impossible for the fan,.to see the actual

. game their ﬁrst time out. They end up get~

ting caught up in the traditional aspects of
the game . and thinking of it as a
sideshow." ‘ _ '

What spectators are missing, in keeping
closer watch on their growing intoxication
rather than the game's score, is the im-
provement in the quality of play of the
game and the seriousness of the
competition. _ - ,

“This is a higher quality game than it
was when I began playing three years
ago.” said Corigan. a’senior. “The quality
of play is improving and the players are
taking the game more seriously. The game
itself is more important than partying,
we'reas much a sport as hockey or any
other freak show." ‘

Not exactly. Pat. The fact that Corigan

refers to himself as “presidint”. coupled
with the fact that-the team practices on a
remote ﬁeldnear Indian Lake (“We have a
tree down there that marks the spot," ex-
plains Corigan). points out an important
aspect of the sport; the team, which was
founded at Albany in 1974, is actually an

, SA funded club, and not NCAA afﬁliated.

sport’s lack of monetary compensation
for the ordeal-the players endure during
the course of the game, beginning with the
alcoholic refreshments brOug'ht out to the
teams during halftime, and ending with the
legendary party afterwards. " A _
“it's just courtesy. being a good host to

your opponent,” explains Corigan.

F ‘The game itself is more important than
«partying-,9 . ' -

— Pat Corigan

 

"We're funded as though we’re an in-

tramural team. which we are, which means
we have to request ﬁelds. that sort of

thing," said.Corigan. “And'since we only V

have 40 members, we’re a minor in-
tramural team at the ."

Actually, that’s in keeping with the
tradition, because rugby‘is truly an
amateur sport." ' '

“if you open the rulebook," said Cor-
igan, "rule number one reads. ‘no player
shall receive monetary payment for
piaying'."

But the tradition makes up for the

Dane netmen host SUNYACs today

“Think about it. you invite a team from
four hours away to come play you. the
least you can do is show them a good time
when it’s over. This is a gentlemens
game.” .

The “gentlemen” of Albany’s rugby
team are currently on. a two game win
streak. Having lost their first two games to
Siena, 18-3. and Plattsburgh, 22-6. Albany
edged out‘ Hamilton. 4-0, and crushed
R.P.l.. 30-3.

“We really wanted to change the date of
the Siena game. we didn't think we'd be
ready for it and we weren't," said Cor-

igan. But we did manage to hold them
scoreless in the second half.”

The Piattsburgh game, in which the
Danes led 8-10 going into the second half;
was the opposite of the Siena contest.

“Plattsburgh scored on breakaways.”
said Corigan. “We let down in the second
half. we left some holes in the back.”

Against Hamilton, things were
technically better for the Danes. as their
field position and good back play were the
keysto their victory. However, as Corigan
explains. “We should have won by more,
we made a lot of mental mistakes. We did
our best to lose the game and won in spite
of ourselves."

The Danes‘ overwhelming victory over
R.P.l. was, according to Corigan, a true
indication of the team’s potential.

“We didn't make any stupid mistakes in
that game. except for these we rode
because we were killing them so badly,"
said'Corigan, “ we’ve' improved in every
game.”

Which brings us to Union this Saturday
at 1:00PM.

“We’re optomistic about the game. they
only beat RPI 3—0. But this game is a real
rivalry, they’ll take it more seriously."

Both the game and the tradition. E]

onial to post a win against the
Pennslyvania school. Sean Reed
rounds out the, top six from
Binghamton.

‘ilrfir‘syt played Sean Reed when
l was in high school," said
Albany’s Bob Siracuse. “I played
with him over the surnrher, he's
pretty tough and a 'good player.”

At first doubles for Bingham-
ton are Grundfast and Croat.
Playing second doubles are a

returning duo from last. year, ‘.

Bimbaum and Meltzer. Third
doubles for the Colonials are
Alfano and Reed.

“1 think we’re improved in
doubles from last year," said
Binghamton’s Head Coach Frank
Pollard. “I don’t worry about
seedings so much, i think it’s
good to have a match in‘ the ﬁrst
round that gets you into the
tournament." ’

On Wednesday Albany played
against the Universitynof

Massachusetts. winning 8-1. The
ﬁrst singles player for the U of
Mass. was not there so all of their
players moved up one.

“it was good to take a team
like the U Mass and destroy
them." said Dane team captain
Jay Eisenberg. “Everyone had
good wins. Grossman played a
super third set.‘ All ﬁve of us
played well.”

The Danes’ only loss came at

sixth singles. Mitchell Gerber, in
his ﬁrst singles match this year
upon returning from an injury.
lost to Massachusetts'_ Mike
Toﬁas 3-6, 6-3. 7-5.

“It was Mitchell’s ﬁrst com—
petitive singles match this
season.” said Eisenberg. “He lost
it close. it’s tough to just step
right in and play when you
haven’t been."

Dermansky sat out of his

singles match Wednesday because
his knee was bothering him. He
did team up with his doubles part-
ner, Eisenberg, to beat Mark
Weinstein and Flicks Rodman,
6-2, 6-2.

The SUNYACs promise to be
very competitive. especially in the
ﬁnals on Saturday. “1 hope the
tradition of it all and our winning
attitude will offset some of our
physical problems.” said Lewis.
