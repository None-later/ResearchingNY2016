Facing the most treacherous
and dangerous competition of the
season, the Albany State men’s
cross-country team came out on
top over three teams this past
weekend.

The harriers traveled to Garret
mountain New Jersey, Saturday
the ﬁfth, where they defeated
Division lll schools Ramapo,

15-50; Trenton, 20-43 and Mont-.

clair State, 2043. This gives
Albany a 10-4 record with two
more teams left on the Harrier
duel meet schedule.

The harriers arrived at the
storm-ravaged racecourse Satur-
day to find only two of the
originally four scheduled teams
present: Ramapo and Trenton.

Arriving about 20 minutes before
the starting time was home team
Montclair State.
Queens College never showed up
for the meet.

Montclair and Trenton
together showed reluctance to run
because of the bad course condi-
tions. The Albany runners
though, were not about to turn
around and take a 3% hour van
ride home without running, so the
meet was on. »

Runners from Trenton and
Montclair took out the pace hard
from the start, as Albany hung
loose. Soon these front runners
dropped back and Albany took
control of the race. Co-captain
Craig Parlato steadily moved into
a 30-yard lead about half-way
through the race. Unfortunately

One team.

Parlato did not get the victory he
deserved. Due to a badly marked
and poorly organized course,
Parlato took a wrong turn in the
woods and lost his position. ,

Albany was able to make up for
this setback With its strong pack
running, as Albany State runners
took positions third through
ninth at the finish.

Taking first in a time of 27:35
was "mystery runner” Ron Kulik
of Montclair State. A recent
transfer to Montclair State, Kulik
was not in uniform.

“Some of our guys didn’t even
know who he was running for.”

commented co—captain lan

Clements, who observed the race.

Taking second in 27:44 was
Trenton runner Tim Gallagher.
Following him tolead the seven

man Albanyjpaclt was senior
Kevin Sh'eehan in a time of 27:51.
Close behind was last week’s

“Runner of the Meet" Tim Hoff '

and the consistant Jack Glaser,
both who finished in 27:54.
Glaser, who has taken 5th place'in
his last three races commented on
the Conditions. ‘

“A storm had washed a lot of
mud off the hills so we ran down

steep rocky hills into ankle deep'

mud at the bottom. We also had
to run through a one foot deep
stream. The conditions were terri-
ble but kind of fun.", 1

Next to finish was Senior Ray
Volper in 28:11. followed by
Trevor Hash in 28:l9 and Pat
Paul in 28:26. Finishing up the
pack in ninthwas junior Scott
Miller in a time of 28:30.

Miller has been a pleasant sur-
prise for Albany .in the past few
weeks: Tritnsfering' here from

recognized as “Runner of the

Meet" this weekend. '
Finishing up further back in the
race were Charles Blanchet, 13th

17th, in 29:l2; Craig Parlato,
18th. in 29:12 and Paul Dietz,
2Ath, in 30:14. ‘ ‘
When asked how he felt about
the results of the meet, Coach

. Munseyresponded.

“l was just tickled pink with
the results. if we can get a couple
of guys up ahead of that pack we
will be strong for the big meets

guard Vinnie Mattaliano is a must. Mat-
taliano, who is being scouted by the New
England Patriots, is capable of
singlehandcdly disrupting an offense.

Pat McCullough. the small but feisty
center. is the man assigned to the task. But
according to some players, the coaches
have implemented a couple of blocking
schemes in order to help out McCullough,
who will be outweighed by 35 pounds.

“Pat does a decent job all the time."
said Ford. “He‘s a fierce competitor and
size differential doesn't bother him. He's
going to be going up against a helluva
football player."

“I think the key to the game is if we
could handle their nose guard," said
Milano. “Pat could do it. He did okay last
year against him, but he’s so much better
than last year."

Of courseMilano is pravina that he isn’t

forced into a close, physical relationship
with Mattaliano tomorrow at Bowen
Field. The Huntington connection of
Milano to wide receiver John Donnelly has
been magical this season. Donnelly, who
has )5 receptions for 25l yards. is also a
passing threat on the reverse option.

Fullback Dave Soldini is still not 100
percent healthy. and Ford says that this
type of rib injury will not fully heal this
season. Ro Mitchell, coming off a spec-
tacular 74-yard touchdown run Saturday,
and Dana Melvin will play a vital role in
blocking the Owls’ cornerbacks when run-
ning the veer. “Their corners come up a
lot,” said Mitchell, who leads the Danes in
rushing with 206 yards. “Our job is to
block them. Looking at the ﬁlms last year,
if a couple of blocks were made on their
cornerbacks, we'would've scored.”

On defense. the Danes have lived up to

,their ‘dog pound‘ nickname. The unit has

not let up more than 15 points a game this "
season, and the healthy return of Dennis
Murphy has been a big plus. There hasn’t
been a weak link on the defensive staff yet.
The line of Chris Esposito, Rick'Punzone,
Greg Hart and George laccobaccio has
played ﬂawlessly. The linebackers, Frank
Sarcone and Scott Dmitrenko, have also
done an super job stopping the run.‘

And in the backfield, premier safety
Wayne Anderson is heading a young but
solid corps consisting of Kerry Carrol,
Rich Kozak and Mike Rieger.‘

The Owls' offense isn't the scariest of
attacks either. “They’re not a great offen-
sive unit," said Ford. “Their defense is
much superior."

“We want to force them into passing the
ball." said Anderson, who ran back a
kickoff 93 yards Saturday. And we haven't
seen them throw the ball deep yet." . .4.

quarterback, with aplatoon system at run-
ning back including Glen Kimbrough.

But it is the defense that should decide
this ' one. The Owls have four All-East
defenders, Mattaliano, defensive end Rob
Wilson, defensive back Rich Atkinson and
linebacker Ron Wilson.

Ford considers Albany State the under-
dog tomorrow, citing the Owls' strong
position at the Division 11 level. ‘ ‘

By Rachel Braslow
smmmr. ASSISTANT" '

The Albany State women’s cross coun—_
try team will meet up 'with five area col-
leges Saturday for the annual Capital:
District meet; 1 Albany "looks to be the
favorite in this competition in which they
havewon'the' past'tliree'years.  v r 4

The other participating colleges include ,
St. Rose.» Siena, Skidmore, Union and
R.P.l. Albany will have not only depth
and experience in their favor, but the home
course advantage in'this meet as well;

Saturday, Albany” should have its best
turnout of runners so far this season.- Due

to widespreadinjuries on the team, no

meets have been run with a full roster. .

However, this meet should see 80 percent

of the team running. -
Sophomore Kim Pettichord should be as,

strong as ever. along with seniors Kar'en

'Defeo, Lynn Jacobs and Chris Varley.

Juniors Kitty Sullivan, Sue Gulla and
Brenda Watson. and sophomores Rachel
Braslovr and Roseanne Smith will be com-r
peting;.Freshmen Mary- Lou webster and

Jackie Phipps-should also provide some _.

stiff competition. Whether senior co-
captain Bette Dzamba will run is still
debatable} according to White.

Meanwhile, seniors Donna Bumham
and Sue Spector remain injured along with
junior Maura Mahori. ’ ‘

"On paper we're the strongest team.”
White added “l'm amazed at how will the
other teams have come along since last
year." Both White and R.P.l. cross coun-
try coach- Lee Wilcox agree that "in-

. dividually, Ellen Cavallo (Siena) is the
favoritle Laura Russell of Sierra also
looks strong. .

Wilcox expects Siena and RPI. to "ﬁght
it out'for second.” He added, “SUNY is a
solid favorite." in earlier competition this
year RPI. beat Union, I St. Rose and

Skidmore.

RPl boasts Andrea Zekas as their
number one runner. St. Rose’s Catherine
Mulderry also looks strong.

Not only will this meet provide competi-
tion for the SUNY squad but, “it's the last
meet in which we can run everybody in a
contest.",White added, ‘ ‘it's an indication
of who will fit into the post seasonrunning
team."

This will be the last race for the Albany
team in which everyone will run together in
one race. White is limited to ten entries in
the SUNYACs next Saturday being held in
Brockport. » '

beneficial. V v ' ‘

The Danes made far too many mistakes,

but also played several awesome matches.
But'in the end, the team just didn't play
well enough to keep a consistant Skidmore
team from shutting them out, 9-0.
. Theteam got yet another excellent per-
formance from its stellar number one
singles player, Geri Chiodo. Chiodo

Pam Thompson. 456, 276.

Thompson, who is ranked in thetop 10

SUNYAC championship last year, so the
fact that Geri gave her a tough match was

At second doubles, Levy and Goldberg

were willing to rush the entire set. They
lost 8-4.

At third doubles, Nina Cheung and
Nancy Forbes lost to Sally Livingston and
Barb Schwartz, l-6, 6-7. Nina and Nancy
didn’t have their rythm in the ﬁrst set. The
match did feature some remarkable
returns from Forbes. ’

But the team seems ready to go.

Explains Chiodo:“We're all really ex-~

cited abont playing Binghamton. We have
a very good chance of winning the
SUNYAC championships. Binghamton
will be our greatest challenge."

Binghamton coach Curt Coutts agrees,
stressing that “both Albany and Bingham-
ton will most probobly be the two teams
battling it out for the SUNYAC
championship. ' ’

Coach Myers and the Danes would love
nothing more, but ﬁrst they must hope
they can do it in Binghamton this Friday.

Coach Myers summed up the match:
“We made too many mistakes that we just
couldn't get away with. Skidmore's too
good a team not to take advantage of all
those mistakes”-piand they did.

The Danes will lay it all on the line Fri-
day, when they go up against their biggest
SUNY rival Binghamton. They won’t be?
able to make any mistakes against
Binghamton either.
