straight SUNYAC title. That rs as

up.

Bob Lewis. “We‘have to play
very well in this tournament."

The Danes host the tourna-
ment, which began this morning
and continues until tomorrow at
the Capitaland Racquet Club in
Albany.

With the emergence of stronger
tennis programs at other SUNY
schools, the Danes' six year
domination of the tournament is
coming to an end. Even last year,
the tournament came down to the
doubles ﬁnals.

in last year's finals, Albany,
ahead of Binghamton by a mere
half point, was playing the Col-

onials in two doubles finals and_

needed only one of those wins to
clinch the championship. The
Danes took both of the two mat-
ches to win the championship
with 20 points, leaving Bingham-
ton trailing with '17 1/2 and the
University of Buffalo with 15.

This year’s tournament has all
the makings of a repeat of last
year. The competition will be
close between the three top teams
and Oswego shouldn’t be totally
overlooked either. Doubles play
will once again be a key-factor
deciding the eventual champions.

“One thing in our favor is we
have a good schedule," said
Lewis. “We play a lot of tough
matches."

The fact that the Danes aren’t a
shoo-in certainly doesn’t take
anything away from the team,
which enters the tournament with
an 8-1 record. it will be even more
impressive if they win after facing
such tough competition. ' -

“i welcome the challenge."
said Lewis. “it's good to see the
other programs getting up there."

The University at Buffalo

enters the SUNYACs with a 7-2
record, suffering ’54 losses to
both the University of Rochester
and Edinbourgh University. The
team is traditionaiy strong at the
top of the ladder and should be
seeded high at the first four
singles positions and first
doubles. ‘ '

At ﬁrst singles for Buffalo is
Ken White, the winner of this
fall's ECAC tournament. White.
defending SUNYAC champion at
second singles and at first
doubles, comes into the tourna-
ment undefeated in his eight dual
matches. White .beat Albany's
Tom Schmitz in the ﬁnals for the
second year in a row in last year’s
SUNYACs.

According to Lewis, when
White was playing second singles
last year, he was extremely close
in ability to the ﬁrst singles player
Russ Trinjali. Albany's number
one singles player Dave Grossman
beat Trinjali to capture the
SUNYAC championship at that
flight last year. Grossman will
now be pitted against White.

“He's just as good as Trinjaii.
The two of them are very close in
ability." said ,Lewis. “Even
though Grossman is defending
champion, White will probably be
the number one seed based on his
performance this fall. He's
deﬁnitely favored to win.”

Playing second singles for Buf-
falo is Dan Scheulfa'nd. with a 7~0
dual match record. At third
singles is Ed Wagner, who comes
in with at the 6«l mark. Tony

The Albany State Great Danes are soun-
ding like a loose and conﬁdent bunch as
they prepare for their most pivotal game
since 1982. And why shouldn’t they be.

After outscoring their last three op«
poncnts by i23-31. including a 33-15 drub-
bing of Division ii Springfield last week,
the Danes are ranked eight in the nation in
a Division III poll, and third in New York
State behind lthaca and Union.

That ranking should climb if the Danes
can pull off a victory tomorrow at New
Haven's Bowen Field against Division ll
Southern Connecticut. considered the
most fearsome team on this year's
schedule.

The Owls, who were rated in the Top to
of the Division ll polls last week. mashed
Albany State in 1984, 39-0, marking the sc-
cond worst-beating in Dane history. The
()wls are also fast becoming a NFL foot-
ball factory as Travis Tucker. a tight end
last season. is playing for the Cleveland
Browns. and Kerry Taylor is a backup
safety for the San Diego Chargers.

But are the Danes worried? Not at all,
Albany State, riding a three-game winning
streak, are ranked in the Top l0 in the
country for the first time since 1982. even
if it is just a Division lll'poii. And sudden-
ly. the words. “playoff contender". are
back in the Albany State football
vocabulary.

“if we're going to make the playoffs.
this is the game that is going to get us in,"
said quarterback Mike Milano, who suf-
fered a broken nose against Springﬁeld
and will be playing tomorrow with a face
guard attached to his helmet.

Milano seems the most conﬁdent of all
the Danes. “He‘d be conﬁdent going into
World War lll.” joked Coach Bob Ford.

The Huntington-born quarterback is
probably the only player on Albany with
an undefeated record against Southern
Conneticut. Two years ago. as a
sophomore. he spearheaded the Danes to a
stunning upset over the Owls in New
Haven. Last season. when Southern Con-
necticut was getting their revenge. Milano
watched helplessly from the pressbox. nur-
sing his season-ending fibula injury.

“Two years ago they took us lightly,"
said Milano. ranked sixth in the East in
passing efficiency. “This year they're not
going to look past us. They’re prepared for
us and we're prepared for them."

Owl Head Coach Dick Cavanaugh took
extreme notice to Albany State’s rout over
Springﬁeld Saturday. The week before.
the Owls had to struggle to defeat the
Chiefs, l6—7.

“Albany always concerns me." said
Cavanaugh. “They're a good team, well-
coached. they hustle and they execute well.
They're no different from the other Dlvi-
sion ll teams we play."

The Danes however, are different from

the other squads Cavanaugh’s team faces;
they use a wishbone veer offense.- a forma-
tion that the Owls see only once a year and
have had problems in the past defending it.
Last year the Owls did an outstanding job
shutting down the wishbone attack, but
that was without Milano.

“Milano makes them go." said
Cavanaugh. “But the wishbone is a tough
offense to shut down. They have a lot of

offensive threats that can hurt us."

“i think we can run the veer against
them." Milano said. “if they give us the
same defense as they did last year. we’re
going to win. We have some different
concepts.” . ‘
