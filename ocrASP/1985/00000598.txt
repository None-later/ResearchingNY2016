Unfortunately, "Zonker is the one
character who has changed the least, and
he suffers from that. Alwaysa favorite, but
always a bit more spaceythan any of the
strips other characters, he. doesn’t translate
into the real world very well, which may
be one of the reasons that Trudeau chose
to keep him in. school. However, it
becomes tedious, because the reader has
seen Zonker in school before. The excite-
ment of Doonesbury's return was suppos-
ed to be finding out what happens to
everybody, and too much time is spent
with Zonker and Duke, who are doing the
eXact same things they've been doing since
they were first introduced.

All in all, the Doonesburys and the
Redferns are the characters who‘ve aged

most gracefully. Trudeau’s series on the
homeless, with Rick Redfern as it's center-
piece, mixes humor with deadly
seriousness as one strip . ends with a
homeless woman being covered by show
while sleeping in front of the White House.
The rest of Doonesbury’s cast still seem
a bit immature, and don’t go over as well
any more, but this may be because
Trudeau doesn't really focus on them
enough. ‘

dealt with the making of the USA for

Moolb County (AP) — Convicted rapist
and murderer Michael Winchester was ex-
ecuted by firing squad this morning in the
courtyard of Livingston Prison. Doctor
William Austin pronounced Winchester
dead at 6:23 am. “Three bullets pierced his
heart. There was no suffering. He died in-
stantly,” Austin said.

Present at the early morning execution
were Winchester’s parents, his ex-wife,
Marie, prison warden Stanley Coleman,
and the original prosecuting Judge, John
Eldridge. “He got what he deserved. Justice
was carried out today,” Eldridge said. "He
was a menace to society.” Winchester was
convicted October 19, 1983 on eight
counts of rape and first degree
manslaughter in the deaths of eight pro-
stitutes.
