NUMBER 30

 

. By Lisa Ftlzzoio :1

\ .Although the recent livciperccnt budget
cuts for Studﬁllf: -:Ass'ociation funded

' Voverspcnding. thc‘rcason behind it is far

'_iess grim than its results.
, According to Mark Rivers. chair of the
Intercollegiate Athletic Committee of Cen-
tral Council one of the main reasons for
the. approximately S7743 overspending is
that more teams madeii tothefinals than
wérc expected to. Ten thousand dollars
was allocated to the post-season con-
tingency fund. which is used when teams
qualify. for the ﬁnals. So many teams
qualiﬁed for post-season play said Rivers,
that $15,313 was spent, leaving a $5.313
deﬁcit in the post-season contingency
fund. ' .
According to SA Controller Eric
Schwartzman. the extra money was spent
“against the general SA banking
account." ~ -
Men's Varsity basketball coach, Dick
Saucrs, said that the National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA) has reim-
bursed the teams for post-season play in
the-past, but now the women’s division ill
basketball team also .has a post-season

- tournament! and; the-NCAA cannot afford

to rcimburscﬁgthc teams to more. “The
team-cannot!» 'dcnicd attending the

‘ playoffs."~ said Scucrsa,

According to: Sch‘v'lartzman. another
causo for-tho deﬁcit is inﬂation in food
prices. I - I . -

“The teams are budgeted a certain
amount of money for each meal. At mid-
year there became a need- to increase the
per dicm. When the I team's money
allowance was increased, the appropriated
fund was not increased." said
Schwartzman. ,

When asked why they took the risk of
creating a deﬁcit, Schwartzman said. “It

was-something we felt was unavoidable.”
The lack of gate ticket. sales was another
cause _' for the deﬁcit. According to the
schedule of receipts and expenditures from
the athletic, advisory board activities,
$6.000 was estimated for gate receipts and
only $5,290.“: taken in. leaving a $710
deficit. “We Over-anticipated what gate
receipts would be.” explained Rivers.
According to varsity baseball coach Ed,

scheduled . and: 0'1in twenty-three were
played. Last year twentyi-scvcri games were
scheduled and twenty-six were played. so
more money was needed than anticipated.
we just got lucky as far as weather was
concerned. We had a nice Spring in
Albany last year.” ' , ‘
The athletic over-spending created a
deficit in the SA budget last year. and. as a

result, SA was forced to cut funded
groups' budget spending lines by 5 percent
this year and income iincs by-3 percent.
The athletic fund was not cut. v

According to Schwartzman, the reason

' is that athletic teams receive a separate

portion of money from the Student Activi-
ty fund. The athletic budget is controlled
by the SUNY Board of Trustees. while SA
controls the budgets of other campus
groups. . ‘ ., *

_ When asked how a deficit will be avoid-
ed this year. Rivers said, “We are going to
keep better tabs with the teams this year
and work closer with them so we know
when they are coming close to overspen-
ding their budget. Then we can help them
out." r E]

SUN Y audit-

finds misused
sabbaticals

Albany. N. Y.
(AP) SUNY's sabbatical leave program
and the ﬁnancial controls at one of its
colleges in Syracuse have been criticized
in audits issued by State Comptroller
Edward Regan.

Regan said last Thursday that some
SUNY academic and administrative 1
employees were taking sabbatical leaves
improperly by not meeting all condi-
tions of the program.

The leave policy allows employees to

take off a year at half their normal
salary or a half year at full pay to travel,
study, do research or write. During the
two accadcmic years ending June 30.
1984, SUNY spent $18.5 million to pay
1.027 employees on leave, the audit
said.
The audit found that 14 employees
failed to return to SUNY for at least one
year after their leaves. in violation of
SUNY policy. but no attempt was made
to recover their sabbatical salaries of
$228,000. .

in addition. the audit said that: ﬁve
employees were granted leaves even
though the required six years hadn't
elapsed since their last sabbatical leaves.
23 were granted leaves based on vague

roposais, 34 pgrformed activities on
"eav'e that differed significantly from
their approved activities. and 12 failed
to accomplish their leave objectives
because they became sick.

Other employees failed to provide
enough information about their leaves.
the audit found.

The audit also said SUNY failed to
follow recommendations in a 1980 audit

Quad Walks-Shed flight on dangerous areas

By Olivia Abel

To promote and improve campus safety,
Student'Associatlon is conducting
,“lighting walks" around each quad to in-
spect the safest and most dangerous places
to be at night. _,

SA Media Director. Doug 'Duttlc, led
about 20 students around Indian Quad
Thursday night. pointing out areas that
should be avoided and noting things that
the university could do to improve campus
safety. ‘ ‘

Major suggestions included fixing
brokcn- lights and making existing lights
brighter. Moving lugc'bushes and trees
along the path to the parking lot and in-
stalling morc emergency blue light phones
on Perimeter Road.

Although not much of lndinn Quad is ’

brightly‘lit. the’lndlan Quad parking lot
and Perimeter Road area surrounding the
quad is considered one of the most unsafe
places on campus. according to Turtle.

There is only one blue light emergency
phone in the parking lot and it is located
close to the quad. Tunic suggested that it
should be placed closer to Perimeter Road,
and most of the students on the walk
agreed.

The soccer field behind lndlan Quad is
also considered a potentially dangerous
arcs. said Tunic. Students often walk
through the field at night returning from
popular hung-outs like Sutton and Across
the Street Pub. One student described it as
“walking through total darkness."

 
 

According to Tuttle. “attacks occur
much less frequently when women are
together in lighted areas." ’I‘uttlc also said
that the more students who get involved,
the greater the chance the administration

will do something about he lighting issue. i

There has already been a lighting walk
on State Quad and all the remaining
quads. including Alumni will be toured in
the near future, said Turtle. On Monday.
October 28. the Women’s Safety Task
Force will lead a walk of the entire
arnus.

."Wc'rc trying to add a sense of urgency
to improve lighting on campus. We want
the university to reevaluate its priorities so
that projects that are now nine years down
the road get consideration now. We want
the-lighting more closely monitored and
the lights rcpan'cd more quickly,” aid
Tuttlc. . .

Students who participated on the walk
agreed that it was helpful and informative.
Gretchen Saborit. a first year student liv—
ing on lndian Quad. said she participated
n the walk because she “wanted 1 know

   

 

Women's safety cited In effort to coordinate lighting.

where to walk and where not to walk and
to make my job as an escort easier.”
Saborit is a member of the “Don’t Walk
Alone" student escort service.

DJ. Barish. who is also involved in the

‘ “Don’t Walk Alone" program. said she

participated in the walk because she
wanted “to improve the safety of the
campus."

Betty Ginzbcrgy SA Director of Student
Programming. helped to organize the
walk. and stressed the fact that "especially
women should never walk alone." Ginz-
berg. who is actively involved in the
Women’s Safety Task Force said she feels
that “because of Karen Wilson people will
take this issue more seriously.” Wilson. a

’ SUNYA student. disappeared over six

months ago.

While Ginzberg quoted an ad-
ministrative official who said that there
had never been a rape on lndian Quad. she
said she feels that improvement is needed
on the campus to insure that there never is.

Ginzbcrg said she wants to make
students aware of Women's Safety
Awareness Day on Nomvcmber 7. The
theme of the event will be “Living Sufcly
in an Unsnfc World." and will include a
variety of workshops and events.

it is very important for first-year
students to attend the event because there
will be a special section devoted to rela-
tionships, sold Ginzbcrg. and many frosh
“me be dealing with sexual relationships
for the ﬁrst time." '
