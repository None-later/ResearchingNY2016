know what was being done in enforcing
the grouper law. One after another
residents who live in student housing
neighborhoods registered their complaints.
One woman complained of the noise, one
complained of the trash in the street,
another complained of parking problems.

As SA President, Gawley said he was
aware of the problems and that “the time
has come to do something about improv-
ing community relations with the school."

Gawley added that. “l’m not here
tonight to say things have totally improved
— we’re trying to get these things going in
a positive direction."

Amidst frequent interruptions from
residents, Gawley explained what SA has
been trying to do to improve relations in
the community, and what has been done to
find a solution for the students who will
soon be affected by the grouper law.
“Something has to be done," Gawley said,
“and we're just asking thatyou give us a
little time for our programs to get going.”

Because of the threat the grouper law
poses to many students. who could be

live. “Students are violating the Grouper
Law right now, but it’s not by choice. For
some there is no alternative but to violate
it,” he said. “There is a problem with
housing, the dorms are at 103 percent
capacity. many students just have no
choice.”

The solution, Gawley said, is to "allow
for us to get our alternative housing pro-
grams started before kicking students'out
on the street. ” in addition. he said, SA has

been reminding the University of its pro- ‘

mise not to increase enrollment next year.

“We know we haven’t touched reality
yet,” Gawley said, “but we are trying. The
time has come. You're tired, we’re tired,
we want to get it worked out.”

Gawley was addressing many residents
who feel the only alternative to getting
their problems with students solved is strict
enforcement of the Grouper Law. “The
main criminals are the landlords," said
one resident at.the meeting. “but that

Not only was there a diversity
of groups invited to participate,
but the program, according to

‘Ginzberg, “is pretty much half
administration and half
students." Pleased with their
reactions, Ginzberg said,
"everybody was extremely
responsive. They took it very
seriously. This is a really good ex-
ample of how we're combining
resources because we‘re
concerned."

SA President Steve Gawley said

, .,that_.the idea to begin a student~

initiated program started “when
we saw that the University wasn't
going to act on the need for non-
alcohol programming ideas.” He

"added that “we’re not going to

gamble with Student Activity fee
money. Down the road, creating
non-alcoholic programs is going
to cost more money."

Mark Rivers, chair of iCAC,
said that athletic events this year

will be free. “As far as l have a .

say in it there will never be a

charge for a game,” he said. in.

the future, there will not be
budgeting or gate receipts for
athletic events. he added.

“The way athletes can bridge
the gap is by providing an alter-
native to those who can’t drink
and those who can drink. also.”
said Rivers. V
