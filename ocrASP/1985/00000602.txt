' Anti-Apartheid Day.

Due to publicity problems, the NYPIRG 'V
Divestment Project’s Anti-Apartheid Day, ‘ '

held last Friday, attracted few people at its
events in the Rat, said co-chairs Rob Guile
and Gary Sealey.

“The event was part of National Anti-
Apartheid Day which was established by
the American Committee on Africa, a New
York City based group,” they said. A

‘film, Generations of Resistance, which
highlights the history of apartheid, was
shown and was followed by student
speakers who discussed divestment and the I
history of apartheid,” they said.

“Future events include a pledge drive .

against South Africa, and on November 1, .-

the National Student Conference on South
Africa and Namibia will be meeting at
Hunter College.’ ’ The two added that they
plan on bringing its many people as
possible.

Volunteers needed

The Teresian House Nursing Home is
looking for volunteers to provide a variety
of different services.

SA registers 4,100

According to Student Action Committee
chair Larry Hartman the committee has
registered 4100 students to vote. He
estimated that NYPIRG registered an ad-
ditional 200 to 300 votes.

“In a non-presidential election year this
has to be termed a success,” Hartman
said. He explained that registration was
Student Action’s “utmost priority" from

 

     

 

the beginning of‘ the semester until the
deadline Friday.‘0ctpber.i-ll.  a  21'.

Student Action's’ next major goal is “to
get 'people to vote on election day.” said
Hartman. He said that a .“Meet the Can-
didates Night” will be held on Sunday,
November 3. at 7:30 pm. in the Campus
Center Ballroom. “Publicity about where

to vote will be available on every quad,” .

said Hartman. He added that election day
they will be going door-to-door to remind

.students to vote. 7

information moves

The information office in the gym has
been moved to the center of the building
near the vending machines.

According to Andrew Schoenfeld, com-
missioner of intramurals the information
office was moved to it’s new location

_ “because it is bigger." Schoenfeld explain-

ed that the information desk was formerly
the intramural office.. ~

The intramural ofﬁce is now located in
room B—109 near the women’s locker
room. Schoenfeld said that the new office
is “a little bit inaccessible." He added that
the move may have hurt the intramural
program because people have trouble fin-
ding the office and it currently has no
phone. '

' UAS, s.ub,VShopse;—panding.
choices of late. It

By Lauren'Moore
STAFF WRITER: ~

Students who get hungry while I

they’re studying . at night no.
longer have to order out for food
and wait a half hour, for it to
arrive. Instead, University Aux-
iliary Services now offers a more
varied menu at their cafeteria sub
shops on weeknights.

Starting this week, UAS will be
selling croissants, fresh fruit, and
bagels at sub shops. in addition to
the current fare of soda. pretzels,
potato chips, and submarine
sandwiches, said UAS General
Manager 13. Norbert Zahm. '

Jobs are provided for is to 20
students through the sub shops,
according to UAS Director of
Food Service Ronnie Clough.

Phil DiGiorgiO, one of the
students who works for the Dutch
Quad sub shop, said the sub
shops provide an important ser-
vice to the students. “I think it’s 'a
good idea. It’s convenient for
students and provides jobs for
students. It’s run pretty well, and‘
everything’s organized, and the
food’s fresh every day. I think it’s
a good idea," he said.

Zahm said that UAS is “very
responsive to new products."' and
that the new items, which have
been requested by students, will
not only bring more businessr but
will also add a greater variety to
the sub shops; -

“We think- they "(sub shops)
have been very ,successful. it
started seven years ago as a pilot
project. The students were very
enthusiastic and we’ve had them
ever since," Zahm said.

" Because“ not mahy students
know about the sub shops, UAS

has also been trying to publicize ’

the service with tabletteﬁts in the
dining halls and ads in the Albany
Student‘Press Zahm said. ,

The sub shops. on, the uptown
campus are, _ located in the
(cafeteria of each quad. On Alum-
ni Quad, the sub shops are open
from 9pm to, midnight on Mon-
days through Thursdays, and
8pm to midnight on Sundays.

Business is generally very good
and consistent, said Clough. ad-
ding that the sub shops do better
in poor weather because students
stay on campus when the weather
is‘bad.

The sub shop on Alumni Quad
does juSt as well as theuptwon
campus sub shops, added Zahm,
saying all Of the sub shops pay for
themselves.

' Clough stressed the conve-
nience of the sub shops and said
that UAS tries “to be competitive
in price and product.” He added
that the sub shops are “profitable
and provide a service to students
they otherwise wouldn't
have . . . I believe its a good 'ser-
vice to the student."

UAS will be offering specials in
the sub shops, both this week and
in the future. Both Zahm and
Clough would net comment on
the specials in order not to “ruin
the surprise," but they did say
that the specials would be adver-
tised and will be beneficial to
students.

The subs offered are:
vegetable, roast beef, mixed,
turkey, ham. tuna. cheese,
bologna, and salami. Prices range
from “.60 to $3.10 and can in-
clude various toppings as well.

Soda sells for 45 cents, and
chips are 25 cents. Fresh fruit and
granola will be 50 cents. The new
croissant sandwiches come in
almost as many varieties as the
