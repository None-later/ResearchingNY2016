COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE— Some
campuses may pull out of one of
the largest university research
bonanzas in American history if the
Reagan administration’s recent
hints that it will stop professors
from publishing their research
results prove true, an ofﬁcial of a
national administrator’s group
warns.

in October, the government will
begin pumping another $600
million into university research labs
that help it research new Star Wars
weaponry.

The controversial project -- for-
mally called the Strategic Defense
Initiative (SDI) -- would put lasers
and other high-tech weapons into
space to shoot down Soviet missiles
in the event of an attack.

Petitions in which university
researchers promise not to solicit or
accept Star Wars research funds are
being circulated at more than three
dozen campuses this month.

.The petitions protest the SDI on.
political grounds, and because the

research contracts may restrict the.

publication of rescarch funded by
Star Wars grants. * A ' '

Scientists seem r most worried .

about the publication issue. .
V"The worst case scenario Would
be that dozen'sof universities wciuld
be forced to pesszon Star Wars fun-
ding because the restrictions Would
violate their policies against con~
ducting classified or secret

research." said Jack Crowley. wh'o‘

monitors federal research funding
for the American Association of
Universities. ‘ ' .

Initially. SDI officials insisted nil
university funding would be for
fundamental research. Professors
and graduate students thus would
be free to publish the results of their
work.»

Then in August, SDI university
research director Jim lonson issued
a memorandum reafﬁrming that
position, yet adding research on
operational capabilities and perfor-
mance characteristics that is “uni-
que and critical" to defense pro-

grimswouldbe‘classified. . ‘ A

University ofﬁcials say they are .
confused. . ‘ “3 - ' '

“It’s not an entirely clear
signal," 'Cr'owley said. "‘We may
have to play this out project~by~
proie‘ct‘", ‘ ' . v2. . ~

“You can't say it’s horrible only
because you're too confused" to

know for sure what they‘re plann-
ing to do," said Massachusetts 'In-
stitute of Technology research vice
president Kenneth’Smith. ‘

Other SDI ofﬁcials have said
researchers couldn't talk about SDI .
research on the phone or in person
unless. a government official“ was
present.

Schools also arc'worricd about
recent statements by SDI director
Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson', who '
said in July that all SDI research
will be subject to “sensitivity
checks." ' ‘

If SDI decides certain research is
“just really amazingly important"
and that it was “absolutely critical
the Russians don't get it," it would
be classified. Abrahamson told The
_Institute, the newsletter of the In-
stitute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers.

In other words, SDI could decide
to classify all the research even after
it promised to treat it as non-secret.

The restrictions "would give rise
to even more tension within any
campus over whether individual
professors should be doing SDI
research. ” Smith. predicted.

_ Star Wars _olrcady has triggered
the most vocifei'ous debate over
federal funding of university
research since the Vietnam War.

At the time, most large research
universities prohibited their faculty
from conducting ‘clnssifiedg
resent . Smith says. ' ' ' '

Secret research is best left to in-
dustry. “giversity ofﬁcials conclud-
ed. beCaus'E' academic freedom re-
quires the results of scientiﬁc
research be available 'to all. ‘

The petitions nowprotcsting ad-
ministration effortsto force schools
to violate the anti-secret research
policies began at the University of
Illinois. > -' '

"It‘s absolutely} unprecedented
for researchers to sgrce not to ac-
cept research funds like this." said
Illinois assistant physiology pro-
fessor Eric Jakobsson, one of those -
who started the petition'drive.

Earlier this'ycar. thc'federal bia-
tional Science Foundation pro-
hibltcd four universities"with NSF-
fundcd supercomputcrpcnters from
allowing Russian and Epstcrn Euro-
penn scientists; to: “use the' ‘
computers. , ' ,

After Cornell and I'Illinois of-
ficials refused to accept the restric-
tions. the NSF withdrew the ban in
JUIY. pending a study of the issue.

“The whole thrust‘jof this ad-
ministration‘ls to incrobsc the level
of restrictions on'  sorts of
resourch," Jakobssori charged."

The biggest concern ll Star Wars.
Jakobuon said. because it’s so big.
It's worth $600 million for unlvcrs
titles in the coming fiscal year
alone.

“To the extent universities are
for sale. the Pentagon can buy them
cheap." he said. Cl

donated. local hunger would be somewhat
alleviated, she added.

Referring to student eating habits on
campus. Longobucco said. “In light of the
hunger in our world and our community, it
is wrong to leave half a tray of food un-
wanted when it could mean so much to so
many.”

Citing current food stamps proposals in
Washington, Longobucco said, "Food
Stamps provide a diet that is below the
U.S. recommended daily levels of nutri-
tion. As it is 20 million Americans go
hungry at least one day a month.” adding
that. “This is the program that the Senate
wants to cut. We have to ask ourselves, is
it morally right to make them (the hungry)
pay." ' 'Cl
