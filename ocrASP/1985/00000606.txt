ing able to identify its victims? Us
Did you ever ask yourself these _
questions?

Homosexuality: being sexually-oriented toward v
or having an affectional preference for‘ people of ‘
ene’s own sex; romantic involvement, i.e. love, bet-
ween members of the same sex. Maybe that is hard
to imagine if one could feel comfortible in or desire
intimate relationships with members of the opposite
sex. But fundamentally does it matter what sex the
person that one loves is, especially if the two people‘
are happy in their relationship? What is the Issue I
here? Are homosexual people fundamentally, evil?\
Does the devil make them do it? ,5 - '

Don’t heterosexual and homosexual people have
a lot in common? All people are only people,
besides, aren’t there some things that either of these
groups can do in bed? Are all these acts evil?

There seems to ,exist in this world an entity .
known as homophobia, a concept implying a
discomfort on the part of those afflicted with the
idea of homosexuality or’ with homosexual people.
Perhaps the existence of thisentlty is due to a
misunderstanding of homosexual people and
homosexuality by non-homosexual people. 1

However, such feelings are probably not the fault
of the afflicted non-homosexuals. It would be
understandable if the misunderstandings were due
to misinformation. What images come to mind
when you try to picture a homosexual person? A‘
gay male? A lesbian? Perhaps your images are in- *
ﬂuenced by stereotypes. Have you ever met a

. homosexual'person? ‘

People say things like. “i don’t care what two
people of any sex combination do in bed. I don't
see the need to discuss diScrimination against 'gay
people." Okay; but how do you feel about seeing
two people of opposite sexes kissing or “making
out" in public? And when two people are of the
same sex? Does the latter’ scene make you feel un-
comfortable? Can your reaction be described as
“homophobic?” ' - ~

Most people would agree that discriminating pre-
judicially against different groups of people is‘
wrong. 'A homophobic reaction to the above
scenario is unfair; too'. 'Sure.‘ there are some dif-
ferences between‘gay and non-gay people — take
their sexual preferences for instance — but all peo- »
pie have one thing in common: we're all people.
Across all groups. there are a lot more similarities
than differences among us. ‘

anyway. it carries the'sarne implications‘as the word

.‘fstraightﬂ when it 'stands for. “heterosexual.” that ‘
' homosexuality. is right and homosexuality is not.
' Whatitdifl'eren‘ce does it make who you love and

;nlake‘loye to? Prom-cation is one good reason to
have sex, but _ItomoseXuality hasione thing going for

' it: it beats heterosexuality with respect to birth-

control.

, However, the point here is not to advocate
becoming gay, or to “conve " anyone. but rather
to encourage people of whatever persuasion to feel
comfortable with themselves withrespect to their
sexual and affectional'preferences as well as with
the preferences of others. ' . ,

' Prejudice, by definition. is unfair and both gay
and non-gay people must work together to
eliminate the prejudice against gay people. To the
“oppressors.” the stereotypes need questioning.
but to the “oppressed,” we have to let the world
know‘we are people, too. Stereotypes cannot ac-
curater represent any group of people; people can
only represent themselves.

The only generalization that can'be ascribed to
gay people refers to sexual preference, period.
Perhaps if non-gay people were sensitized to gay
people.'lt would not be such a big deal and there
would be less misunderstanding. Sex and relation-
ships are two pretty broad topics for anyone to have
to censor from public expression.

The Gay and Lesbian Alliance is the only
S.A.-funded group devoted to the interests and

concerns of-homosexual people as a minority group -.

on this campus. We meet Tuesday nights at 8:30
p.m. in Campus Center 375, and though we want to
emphasize that anyone is welcome to attend. we

. have speakers and hold discussions about questions -

relevant to the gay community besides organizing
social activities. The GALA ofﬁce is located in CC
333 and the phone number is 442-5672.

If you are questioning your own sexual
preference or just want to ﬁnd out about gay con-
cerns, stop by the office or come to the meetings.
We don't discriminate against anyone. besides, we
need Everyone's Support. ‘ - III

Committee. . I . .
