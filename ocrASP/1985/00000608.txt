that would have reduced abuses of ' sab-
batical leaves.

Another audit by Regan said that the
SUNY College of Environmental
Science and Forestry in Syracuse failed

to adequately control cash receipts of
almost $3 million per year.

The audit, covering a period ending in
June 1984, said that cashiers had too
much control of money, opening the
way for possible employee theft. It sug-
gested that responsibility for dealing
with cash, handling accounting records
and bank deposits, and preparing
checks be split up among more
employees. .

in a written response to the sabbatical
audit, SUNY ofﬁcials said that “we
believe that, on the whole. the State
University and its faculty have made a
wide and appropriate use of sabbatical
leave privileges, and that the campus adv
ministrations have been vigilant in con.
forming to the Trustees' policies concer-
ning the granting of these leaves."

The SUNY response said that “99.3
percent of the faculty who were granted
sabbatical leaves satisﬁed all of the
eligibility requirements. and 98.1 per-
cent satisfied the obligations to return

doesn’t help. We’re tired of being woken
up at four in the morning. Something must
be done.”

After arriving forty-five minutes late,
Alvaro addressed the group saying that
“my job is to enforce the Grouper Law to
get safe, clean, quiet neighborhoods." He
said he is willing to “give Steve a chance,"
but he won't let the community “put up
with what it‘s been putting up with for so
long." Student housing “is Albany's pro-
blem. but the University's responsibility,’

 

for one‘full year' at the conclusion of

their leave." . I
The response said that about 90 per-

" .cent of the required reports by those

who took sabbatical leaves were com-
pleted before the audit period ended last
December and said that since then, 99
percent of the reports have been
completed.

SUNY ofﬁcials said that “the Univer-
sity has seriously considered the com-
ments provided "in the audit report and
has established new administrative pro-
cedures which will provide the ap‘
propriate corrections.”

In response to the audit on the SUNY
college in Syracuse, SUNY officials
issued a statement saying there is no
evidence that employees have taken or
improperly spent money. '

. SUNY ofﬁcials said that under ideal
conditions they could separate the job
of dealing with money among more
employees but said that “with our cur-
rent 'staffing level. and level of
workload, it is not possible to imple-
ment suggested changes and still main-
tain a timely operation.” ‘
The ofﬁcials said they are developing
a computer-based student account
system designed to improve operations.

he added. -
“Everything Steve says and you say

makes us understand the problem,” said‘

Alvaro, “but students can't come crying to
us when we enforce the law. Students
know they’re breaking it when they sign
that lease. They have to learn they’re
responsible for their own actions."

“The problem exists but is the answer
the Grouper Law? We have proposed
alternative solutions that we feel will be
very effective once they get a chance to get
started,"said Gawley.’  ' "‘D'
