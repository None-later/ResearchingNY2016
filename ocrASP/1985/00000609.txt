two turning points.”

According to Lewis, Albany's

results from good prparation. "A
thing that favors us is that we play
a lot of tournaments during the

Celebrating was done in a non-
traditional way by the Albany
State rugby team following their
16-9 loss to arch-rival Union on
Saturday.

“Traditionally, we‘ll invite the
other team to go out with us,"
said junior wing, Dean Nasca.
“But we and Union have a bad
rivalry. We clash like oil and
water.”

Albany’s dislike for their oppo-
nent was by no means lessened by
the loss, which will keep them out
of the Upstate Rugby Union
championship next weekend. “It
was a mental block,” said Presi-
dent Pat Corrigan. “We should
have beat them, we made a lot of
stupid mental errors."

The Danes took a 3—0 lead in
the first half when senior wing
Tony Ellis scored a penalty kick.
Union then scored a try to lead
6-3 at the end of the half.

Both Union and Albany scored
twice in the second half, Ellis
scoring again for the Danes. mak~
ing the score 12-9. Later in the
half, Albany was close to scoring

again, bringing the ball to
Union’s 30-meter line when they
lost possesion, and Union ran 70
meters for a third try.

“That was really the turning
point of the game,” said Nasca.
“We pretty much gave up after
that happened.”

“We got discouraged and
winded at the end," said Cor-
rigan. “Union wouldn’t really let
us play our game, which is
basically a speed game. They were
bigger than us, they made us play
slower."

“lt‘s o.k. if they’re little and
big. but they were big and big,
with a lot longer legs,” said
junior Mike Maccache. “it was a
real heartbreaker, we were so
close so many times.”

The Danes’ final games will be
October 26 at Plattsburgh and
November 2, against Albany
Law.

“This was probably our best
game all season," said Corrigan,
“Things that we’ve been talking
about in practice came together
today. Now, we know what we
have to work on till the Spring."
