Every semester in; the. ﬁrst ses-
sion 'of “introduction to

Cinema"— Arthur‘ Lennig says.
“This is 'not going to be Wednes-

day night at the movies.“ ‘and he

means it. “Some people . look
sneeringly at you.when you‘say
you teach ﬁlm,
spent looking at ~ Ffiday
film than at

paintings or at 

literature.” he ~ )

said. ‘ ‘

. Lennig,' who received " his
Master’s ‘degree from SUNYA in
1956 and his Ph.D. fro the
University of Wisconsin, has
taught cinema here' since. 1966.
The walls of his office on the top
floor of the Fine Arts building are
cluttered with movie posters and
autographed pictures collected
over the years. '

“We always taught ﬁlm as art. -
f-Ed Cowley felt, art should be
Imany things," > Lennin‘g ‘said‘,
éjrefering to the former head of the
{art department adding, “in those
.'days it was a broader view."

1 “Some peopletry to teach film
from scripts. They emphasize
story and plot," said Lennig.
,“Having started out as a ﬁlm
maker, 1 have an understanding
of the film as a whole.” ‘

Lennig tried his hand at, film-
making when he was 18, but as he
said, “if you aren’t out in
Hollywood, it's a tough business.
The directors ,I admired were all
kicked out of the business.”
D.W. Griffith, Eric von
Stroheim, and F.W. Mumau are
Lennig’s favorite directors, but he»
added, "Spielberg, for what he
does, is not bad." ,

' The main problem Lennig said
he ﬁnds with movies today is the
commercial situation of studios
trying to find mass appeal in an
age when it’s so expensive to
make a film. _ ~
' “Film is considered an art,
where before it was a business.
.What was produced before was
more artistic than what they put
out today," said Lennig, explain-
ing that “we had a broader au-
dience in the past. Now it’s made
to, click with the 12 to 22 year age
group.”

“I'm more interested in ﬁlms

,up through the 30’s. I consider

them very experimental,- very im-

aginative. They’Ve never been.

ability," said Lennig. '
Lennig. said he misses the days
of the big studios. .“Each studio
made enough films a year, they
could afford to gamble. Now they

November 7 as part of a new
program called Footsteps.
Footsteps originates from-
, the Rotary Career Day, a,
similar program that has suc-
icessfuliy taken place on the
icampus every spring for about
{Esix years, according to
{Footsteps Coordinator Celeste

{.We have;.ali different fields

not do it here?" said Budd.

' There are 485 professionals
on campus and Budd sent let-
ters to each, receiving 52 accep-

ing/psychology. computers.
communications. health ser-
vices. personnel. and university

“We have an endless

Budd attributes it to lack of in;

The students who did applyu'

Psychology major Andrea Vuc-

"Footsteps serves to foster

on campus as little green peo-

people. We need the talking
and sharing." added Budd.
Budd further stated that she
hopes Footsteps is a success

added. ’

As a movie reviewer for the
Albany Times Union, Lennig said
he was disappointed with new
ﬁlms. “l’m not saying disap-
pointed because l’mylooking for
stuffy intellectual entertainment.
1 just want it to be enjoyable
enough to be worth driving forty
minutes to the place and then sit-
ting there for two hours."

Lennig, howeverI has found a
few recent movies to be entertain-
ing including “E.'1‘.", “Kramer
vs. Kramer”, “Shoot the
Moon", and "The ln-Laws".

A materialistic attitude prevails
even in his classes, said Lennig.
"‘One time, i became depressed
because I ran a short Chaplin clip
and a student came up after class
to ask if it would be on the ﬁnal.
What was he going to do,
memorize what he saw? It's there
to be appreciated," he said.

in 195.4, Lennig formed the in-
ternational Film Group (lFG).
When he returned in 1966, he
found the group had moved away
from the early classics. and he has
since brought it back in line with
its original intention. “They

seemed to be happy they were br-
inging in more people than 1 did. '1
told them, I wasn't interested in

quantity. only in quality,” he

said.
The present president of the
.IFG Michele DeMarco said,

“(Lennig) triggered in me a love
