Science fields seen to be opening up‘t‘o

By Linda Greenberg

As is the case in most career areas. the
sciences have always had a certain bias
against allowing women to be full par-
ticipants in the field. Tuesday afternoon
SUNYA Professor Bonnie Spanier charted
the path that has led to greater oppor-
tunities for women in science before a
small but appreciative audience.

The audience, consisting mostly of
faculty members, was there to listen to the
second of a series of “Works in Progress”
lectures sponsored by the Center for the

Praise for libraries

‘Out of 292 academic libraries in the
nation. SUNYA libraries rank 14th for
the number of scholarly articles publish-

nals in the field of library science from
1979 to 1983. '

Moreover, based on per capita pro-
ductivity, the University libraries rank
third along with New Mexico behind the
University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign and Oregon.

Midterm theft?

The midterm for Finance 300 has
been rescheduled after the Finance
Department received an anonymous
memo in which the author claimed to
have seen a student with the exam
before the Iexam date.

The exam, which was originally
scheduled to be administered this past
Wednesday, will be rewritten and given

of the Finance Department.

Humanities. The lectures are given by
SUNY faculty concerning topics relevant
to their ongoing research in a particular
area. Spanier is director of the Women's
Studies Program at SUNYA.

Spanier's lecture, entitled “Feminism in
Science,” recounted the past twenty years
of women and the difficulty women have
had in being accepted in the scientiﬁc
community.

The lecture, according to Spanier,
focused on “tracing the deﬁnition of the
problem of women and science. For whom

has been rumored and we took precau-
tions and rescheduled the exam," he
said.

Bar turns nude

‘ Fearing the possible effects of a
21-year-old purchasing age, a liquor tax
increase, and fines and sentences
associated with driving-while-
intoxicated, a local Binghamton tavern
has decided not to renew its liquor
license and instead turned to nude
female dancers to attract patrons.

The tavern, “Mr. Ron's" will be open'
to 18 year-olds, who would be able to
place tables against the stage, reports
Pipe Dream. SUNY Binghamton's stu-
dent newspaper.

An off-campus group, Citizen’s for a
Decent Community is considering legal '
action against the bar. “We’re not on a
moral crusade." said Susan Brooks,
head of the group. “lt'_s the same as any
group asking for any laws to be enforc-
ed,“ she said. - .

 

is it a problem?" She added, “We are con-
cerned about how new issues have been in-
troduced, and also about the changing
definition of the relationship between
women and science, and essentially
feminism and science." Her goal, she' said,
was to “give a sense of the range of issues
involved."

Spanier began her recounting of history
in the 1950‘s, which was “the period with
the lowest proportion of women getting
their Ph.D.'s in Science. Less than 10 per-
cent of Ph.D.’s were women.” Spanier has
a Ph.D. in Microbiology and Genetics
from Harvard University“

Spanier then moved onto the 1960’s,
which was a decade of much social change.
“The Women's Liberation movement
caused a growing awareness of the ine-
quality in our society.” She said that
“conflicts were built into women's lives
between being wives and mothers versus
the fact that ﬁelds in science were opening
up to which women could potentially
contribute.”

Many articles, books and conferences
on the subject of women and science in the
1960’s and onward emphasized the “ten—

sion between the potential development of

women in science and their potential role
as mothers," said Spanier.

in 1961, the pamphlet ‘Women in
Science Careers” was published in which
“the government encouraged women to
enter careers in science and whose purpose
was to educate employers about the poten-
tial of women,” said Spanier. Running
contrary to the concept of encouraging
women was the idea that their primary

“ "roles were to be wives and mothers and on-
' ly secondarily to-enter the field of science,

she added.

This conflict in women’s roles was
discussed further in the 1964 conference at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,

Science and_£ngineering.'.’. According to
Spanier. keynote speakers jBruno Bet-
telheim and Erik 'Erikson stressed that the
“future of mankind dependedon society
making room for women in science and
politics." ' ' ., _ ' ‘ "

The speakers also theorized that there
was “an inevitable limitation of women in
science" because “womeniw’ould have to
give up the professional aspirations to
become wives and mothers."  ‘

In response to this contradiction made
by the keynote speakers. the President of
Radcliffe College, Mary Bunting. ob-
jected, saying, “I decided many years ago
that I was far more interested in being fact
than in living anyone else's theory.” She
gave herself as a specific examplegof being
both a wife and mother and scientist.

In 1970, a piece of feminist'literature,
entitled “Voices from Women's Libera-
tion" was published which gave personal
accounts of women being discriminated
against in science, both covertly and
overtly. v. ' '

'{I‘uttle said that in his survey of
Indian Quad, the group could not
even find any well lighted routes
between that quad and the Gym,
which he said the most frequented
route to Western Ave.

,There are many other poorly
lighted areas that deserve priority
also. said Tattle, including several
spots on Perimeter Road, the
quad parking lots, the quad bike
rooms, and areas on Fuller Road.

Stevens said all of the areas are

recruited.

“We’ve heard absolutely
nothing from the Administra-
tion," said Joe Leonard, co~chair
of the Gay'and Lesbian Alliance
(GALA). "This being an Institu-
tion of education, the administra-
tion should be taking the lead in
educating the' general public on
and off campus," he added.

“I would like to see them help
us do AIDS Awareness Day,”
said Leonard, explaining that
GALA will be having speakers
