Self-sufficiency
<Front Page  ' 

equal access for students-that mission will ,
be hindered if a student is accepted to two
SUNY schools. The prohibitive costs in
. one area could prevent a student from go-
ing to the school of their choice.
The basis of self-sufﬁciency and our
stance on it is that it is inevitable that here
will be an increase in dorm rates." said

Sarolri. “President Marburger of SUNY ‘

Stony Brook has stated that a $200-$300
room rate increase is likely for that cam-
pus," he added.

Saroki said “Present dormitory rates (at
SUNYA) fall short by about SI million of
what it will cost to run dorms next year.
That’s $1 million that we will have to make
up if the state subsidy is removed.”

“We're not going totally self-sufﬁcient
next year," said Student Action Chair
Larry Hartman. “As it is right now, there
is approximately a $20 million New York
State subsidy for all SUNY schools. That
820 million is being cut ' down to $6.6
million-we’re not losing our entire subsidy
but it is being shrunk by a very large
amount. There will subsequently be less
money available to be divided amongst all
of the SUNY schools. In reality, Albany
State could be run completely self-
sufﬁcicnt as a school," he said.

“All of the schools," said Hartman
“will be making different proposals for
who gets how much of that $6.6 million.
This kind of decision will be made by
SUNY Central." 4

_ “The legislature has make it known that
they are in favor of self-sufﬁciency,” said
Gawley. “In the proposed 1986-1987
budget, there is a hole. This reﬂects the
lack of the state subsidy for state campuses
that is in question-right now."

“We want the state to phase out the sub-
sidy gradually, rather than eliminating i!
all at once. We would prefer, of course,
not to have it removed at all,” said
Gawley. '

Career Day

43 - ' v .
stereotype a lot of students hairs that all
the companies would be, looking for ac-
counting majors."

The business orientation .of , students,
however, was evident by the many students
around the various accounting
representatives. ., '

Accounting majors came to look into
the “Big 8" accounting firms represented

at Career Day, said senior ACcounting ma- K

jor Sal Perednia. 

Students interested in other aspects of
the business world besides accounting also
found opportunities at Career Day. Fresh
Jeff _Stein found a lot of information on
hotel management, “a ﬁeld he said he is
considering tranSfering into.

Sharon Byrne of Touche Ross, an ac-
counting firm, expressed a‘similar view,
adding that'she "would have liked tohavc
seen even more students here."

According to Sue Holub, human
resources recruiter for Cumberland Farms
Convenience Stores, “We're looking for
students with college degrees, not
necessarily business degrees, because we
do a lot of training ourselves." Interested

Science and women

<8 ‘

In I977, Evelyn Fox Keller wrote “An
Anomaly of a Woman in Physics," which
described discrimination both in and out
of the classroom with which she was con-
fronted. and also the loss of credibility
that women scientists suffered if they com-

- 'plained about this discrimination.

Finally. in 1979, the book Fair Science:
Women In the Scientiﬁc Community writ-
ten by Jonathan Cole of Columbia Univer-
sity. confirmed that women were
discriminated against.

Part of Spanlcr's research includes

‘ ‘ feminist critiques of content and construc-

tion of scientiﬁc knowledge. Some ox-

; , "  amiller that Spanlcr gave were “sociology.
 Mum-endocrinology -—

Are there

“One of the problems," said Saroki, “is
that SUNY needs $14.3 million this year
for the transition. That breaks down to a
proposed $9.3 million for this year and $5
million for every year after that."

“Although self-sufficiency is inevitable,
I sincerely hope the State will continue to

subsidize at least some part of the.

residence system," said Abelow.

“I trust we will soon get what we think
our costs ‘will be on this campus and we
can, I hope within the next-two weeks,
come to some conclusions about alter-
native ways to minimize costs," said O'
Leary, adding that budget reviews will be
undertaken. ,

“All of this will be done under the
assumption that the idea of self-sufﬁciency
does pass the SUNY Central Board of
Trustees and that it does pass in the New
York State Legislature,“ headded “We
have to carefully consult where we have to
and watch what’s‘ going on. It's an open
issue." . ‘

Gawley and Abelow met on Wednesday
with 0' Leary and Vice President for Stu-
dent Affairs Frank Pogue to discuss the
impact of self-sufﬁciency on the SUNYA
campus.

Presently, a SUNYA study group, under
the direction of the budget ofﬁce, is look-
ing into how the University increase in-
come so that all of the money needed to
make up the $1 million won’t have to come
from an increase in dorm rates.

The study group, which is presently
meeting, is working through Pogue. “We
will be keeping in close contact with them
to maintain an idea of what they are look-
ing into,'.’_. said Gawley. '

"-We are in a preliminary stage right
now,” said Gawley. “We will have to wait
and see if self-sufficiency will pass the

Board of Trustees at SUNY Central and
should pass, the university must attempt

somehow to increase revenues so we can ‘

MINIMIZE what the impact of self-
sufﬁciency will be.",he_said.  III

students graduating in December. were able
to schedule interviev‘vs at the Cumberland
Farms table.

Sharing information with talented ac-
counting majors was the goal of Touche
Ross representative Byrnc. Qualiﬁed
students were advised to send in their
resumesrsaid Byrne. which are then weed-
ed out beforerecmitmcnt occurs, as it will
at SUNYA on Monday; ' "

“Students with a strong computer

. background" should watch for NBC
recruiters here in February, advised Val
Branker at the popular NBC table. “We're
looking to place people in training pro-
grams.” he said. ‘

The goals of the United States Marine

’ Corps' recruiters distinguished them from

many others at this event. According to
Lieut. Kevin Hallenbeck. "a lot of
students have preconceived notions about
the military. We're here to give them a bet-
ter idea of what being in the military isall
about.”

According to Wagner, "we feel that a
lot of really good information was ex-
changed between students and ﬁrms to-
day." - El

physiological differences between the
sexes't, and menstruation — Do men also _
have land are affected by a ‘hormonal
cyclc'?"

To conclude the discussion, SUNYA
Professor Joan schulz, said she felt that,
“Science must keep up with the 80's no-
tion of a woman being able to ‘havo it
81"! I!

Spar-tier agreed, saying, “The women
