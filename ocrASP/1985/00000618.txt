Albany State spikers drop record
after losses to Colgate. Cortland

By Rachel Braslow
EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

After capturing the Springﬁeld Tourna-
ment on Saturday the Albany State
women’s volleyball team lost to Colgate
and Cortland, dropping their record to
19-3.

Consisting of mainly division ll teams
the tournament was, “the high point of the
week.” according to Head Volleyball
Coach Pat Dwyer. Albany crushed Mercy
College 15~7, 15-2. The Danes continued
as they trounced Keen State 15-6, 15-6.

Albany then went on to beat American
international College 15-7. 15-5. Spr-
ingﬁeld was the next victim in line. Albany
had its one and only loss of the tourna-
ment in their first round of play with Spr-
ingﬁeld, losing ll-S.

However. the Danes came back winning
l9-l7. 15-6. “That was a big hurdle," said
Dwyer. adding. “Our rather- intensive
practices the past two weeks payed off for
us there. The Springfield game was the
best of the season so far."

Albany didn’t stop with Springfield, as
they went on to defeat M.l.T. l9-l7,lS-9.
M.l.T. finished second at the National
Championships last year and also won the
Springfield Tournament the past two
years.

“in this match the team overcame a lot
and played really well although we were
physically and mentally exhausted,"
Dwyer said. ,

The team has been consistent this year.

Leading the way for Cortland will be

sophomore quarterback John Dargle. He

started the second half in the season-
opening loss against the University of Buf-
falo and has remained in the pocket since.

Team members include seniors Terry

Neaton, Karen Truss. Donna Vipulis. and V

Loretta Janus. Junior Patti Munhall and
sophmores Chris Hofer. Yvette R‘ooks.
Amy Rosenberg. and Jill Rosenberg also
play. Newcomers this year are freshmen
Pat incantalupo, Karin Haaland, Julie
Silverbusch. and Nicole Becker. ‘

Tuesday Albany lbst to Cortland. a
team that’s ranked fourth nationwide.
Right after that they fell to Colgate, drop-
ping their record to 19-3.

"The main problem was tension and
anxiety which came out in poor passing.
they (Cortland) scored because of that."
said Dwyer. Albany lost 15-3. 13-5. The
Danes will have at least three more chances

to avenge their loss against Cortland this

season.

immediately following the Cortland loss
the team was forced to play Colgate. Many
of the players were still upset and fatigue
may have been factors in the 4-15. ll-lS
loss.

“We couldn't play service reception. we
didn’t pull together as a team and help
each other when we were down on each
other and that hurt us." said Munhail.

For a team that went to the nationals
last year and lost only three out of its nine-
teen games this season. one would expect a
fairly high rank in the national polls. Due
to an administrative problem with SUNY
Albany’s athletic forms no SUNY Albany
teams have been counted in any poll
rankings.

Pitcher and Todd Hobin are the rotating
fullbacks, with Tim Horton staying in at
halfback.

“They’re balanced enough so you can’t
concentrate on one like you could with
Cook last year." said Ford.

Last year Albany snatched away the
title in a narrow victory over Fredonia
State. This victory broke Fredonia’s six
year winning streak.

“Fredonia is definitely the team to
beat" said ,Head Coach Bob Munsey.
Cortland State and SUNY Buffalo are
also considered strong contenders again
this year. as they took third and fourth
places respectively last year.

“I am worried a little bit because
things have come too easy for our men
this season." said Munsey. “I don’t
know whether this team is a high pac
or just a middle pack team." -

The hariers have 'not experienced
many close meets so far this season. but
Munsey feels that the pressure will bring
out the best in his runners.
