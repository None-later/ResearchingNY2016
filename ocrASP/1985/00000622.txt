musical ability, and eccentric between-J
song patter invariably gets the crowd danc-
ing, and that's just what Rick-Bedrosian and

the rest of the band hope to pull off Satur- * '

day at Party on the Podium.
“The SUNY crowds are great," Bedrov

sian said in atrec'ent telephone interview. ‘

“We really missed playing for the SUNY
crowd. We used to hhve a big following
among the students, but I think most of
them graduated. -

"We’ve been slowly trying to get the
newer students to come hear us.” .

Bedrosian and the rest of the Newports
will get their chance at the Party on the
Podium Saturday, which they have been
booked to play.

The Newports lineup includes Bedrosian
on bass, Kevin and Carla MacKrell on
guitar (and various percussion), Jeff Strange
on guitar, and Todd Nelson on electric
guitar. Sound a little one-sided? It doesn’t
seem to come off that way.

Playing a variety of well-known covers,
such as "Red Rubber Ball," “Spooky,”
“Poison Ivy," and "Bus Stop," the
Newports seem at first glance to be easy to

dismiss as just another cover band. albeita .r

talented one. However, the five per-
formers who make up the band are some
of the more talented performers in Albany.
Rick Bedrosian, for example, first hit the
Capital District playing in Silver Chicken,
from which he graduated to the popular
(and recently defunct) Square One.

 

 

and Todd Nelson.

Todd Nelson, who has been performing
together with Bedrosian since high school,
was a member of Fear of Strangers, un-
doubtedly the most popular band ever to
come out of Albany. When, Fear of
Strangers broke up. Nelson helped form
Square One, and is now playing with'
fellow Newport members Bedrosian,
Strange, and Kevin MacKrell in Don-
nybrook Fair. Also, Nelson was the first

(and still the only) Newport to use an elec-

tric guitar.

MacKrell and Strange have been playing
together in Donnybrook Fair for about 10
years. In Donnybrook Fair, the duo have

toured lreland, and. more recently, the
group has played New York City and
Boston. V

MucKrell and his wife Carla are also part
of the "Albany Acoustic Mafia.” a group of
talented Albany performers like Broadway
Blotto and Bert Somer, who play together
often. '

The Newports have been together, with
various personnel shifts, for about two
years, and during that time have built up a
large following in, Albany. Still, Bedrosian
admits, nobody is kidding themselves
about the Newports. They’re a cover band.
An amazing cover band, sure. But still a

"We're never going to cut an album as
the Newports," Bedrosian said. “it's all
cover stuff. It’s just a way to have a great
time — and pay the rent — while we try to

air.

50 if you're looking for a great time,
since the Class of ‘86 has already paid
Bedrosian‘s rent. why not head over to the
podium Saturday and give the Newports a
listen? As an introduction to Albany music,
or just as a good party band, the Newports
can‘t be beat. D
