Ted Koppel, and this
is “Nightline"—the part
you don‘t see on tele-
vision. Five nights a
week, a far-flung corps of
30-odd producers, corre-
spondents and bookers
put on what may simply
be the best news show
around. “Nightline” is
in a realm by itself. It
makes news as well as
covering it. The editors
of competing publica-
tions sometimes rethink
their story lists accord-
ing to what "Nightline"
features. while college
professors reconnnend
it to their students.
It‘s a program both
for people who love tele-
vision~who savor the
buzz ol’ instantaneous
glohnl communication
“and for those who
say they hate TV—who
watch “Nightline” and
practically nothing else.

The “Nightline” staff
seems to feel a genuine
sense of mission. There

gle. But morale seems generally high. Part
of the explanation is that after ﬁve years
“Nightline” is still on top ofits game, hav—
ing produced a slew of innovative programs
in 1985. And part is Koppel himself—an
intelligent, even inspiring man in a business
with more than its share of airheads.

This article is what “Nightline” would
call an “Insider Report"—an attempt to
peel away the glossy surface of a subject and
reveal what‘s underneath. Rick Kaplan,
who set the ground rules, allowed unusual
access to all dimensions of the program‘s
preparation, except discussion of ABC

uncharitable (though invariably true) char-
acterizations of potential guests. NEWS-

exhausted a marathoner; the staﬁ‘ consid-
ered it comparatively easy.

It‘s 10 am. Tuesday, and Tara Sonen-
shine, “Nightline‘s” Washington hooker
(the person who signs up guests), is getting
ready for another 14-hour day. Sonen-
shine, who graduated from Tufts in 198]
and has worked in different capacities at
ABC ever since, is a little worried about
the topic and guests for tonight's show. As
she looks back on it, the previous night’s
program—a discussion of' the gas leak at
the Union Carbide plant in Institute,
W.Va.~—went well enough. A mere 20
minutes before air time, Koppel picked up
a copy of the next day‘s Washington Post

and saw a story about a
gas leak in the Washing-
ton area. By 11231, foot~
age of the leak site had
been located, fed into
the ABC News control
room and inserted into
the broadcast while it
was on the air. This was
one more of those seem-
ingly effortless tech-
nological achievements
that in fact take a lot of
hard, split-second work.

day are already commit-

shine scans the morn-

At 11, the daily conference call begins.
A staffer in New York provides a run-
down on the overnight news, and Kaplan,
thinking out loud about story ideas,
starts talking about the possible causes of
the recent Japanese-airliner crash. Sonen-
shine mentions standardized tests. Some-
one else mentions a crime story. After a
half hour of discussion, Koppel, talking
from his home in suburban Maryland,
says: “1 don't hear anything that‘s
going to take us away from. what we‘re
going to do tonight. 1 wrsh 1 did.“
Barring breaking news, that
means they will stick with last
week‘s plan and go with a
story on registered foreign

resent foreign governments

eign—policy stories, the idea
grew out of Koppel‘s experi-
