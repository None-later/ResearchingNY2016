MAKE THE FUTURE
A MOVIE IN YOUR MIND.

THE ESSAYS.

Old science fiction movies
seem funny today, but only
because we‘re living in the
future they tried to predict.
Judging the futurists of 25 years
ago right or wrong is not as
important as admiring the spirit
of their work. They allowed
themselves the freedom of
creative thought; the fun

of taking a leap at the future.

That’s the spirit the 1985
Honeywell Futurist Awards
Competition encourages. Imag-
in'e the future 25 years from
now. Then express your ideas
by writing three essays of 500
to 750 words each. For the first
two essays, you're to write
aboutsignificantdevelopments
in any two of the following
subject areas: 1) Electronic
Communications, 2) Energy,

3) Aerospace, 4) Computer
Science, 5) Manufacturing Auto-
mation, or 6) Office Automation.
For the third essay. write about
the societal impact of the
changes you've predicted.

As you write, keep in mind that
your entries will be judged
according to the following point
criteria:

Creativity 30 points
Feasibility 30 points
Clarity of Expression 30 points
Legibility 10 points

Two." That‘s “Nightline” lingo for the nar-
ration Koppel reads a couple of minutes
into each broadcast to introduce the taped
portion. Usually he is a fast and cleareyed
writer—cutting through to the nub of the
show's issue. But tonight his statedjustiﬁca—
tion for devoting “Nightline” to such an
unusually light subject—that these are “the
dog days of summer“—-is apparently too
labored, and Kaplan edits his script down.
The rest of the lead-ins and transitions are
handled by Stephen Steinberg, a veteran
ABC newswriter.

The questions are all Koppel‘s own. But

he insists that he almost never writes them
out in advance. Nor does he request research
memos from his staﬂ‘. Instead, he talks over
the theme of the broadcast with some staff-
ers in the “green room" just off the studio,
then sits motionless on the set for a few
minutes shortly beforeairtime. He says that
the ﬁrst question asked of the guests after
the taped segment is by far the most impor-
tant. But he doesn't even decide on what it
will be until the commercial break following
the taped portion. That way, he asks what is
the most logical question in the viewers‘
minds, given what they've seen on the
screen. “Sometimes being ignorant can be

' a very useful role to play," he says.
Tonight‘s show just doesn‘t click. For
the staff and regular “Nightline” viewers,
the mere idea of Ted Koppel interviewing
Henny Youngman may in itself be so in-
congruous as to be funny. But Youngman,
wearing a hideous tie and shaking a violin
bow he had brought along, turns out to
have nothing interesting to say; he just
brags about future club dates. Monica and
Greene are only a little better, and
Koppel is unable to get the conversation
onto either a humorous or illuminating
track. After the show, Koppel, complain-
ing about how hard it is to interview celeb—
