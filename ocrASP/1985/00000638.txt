A Sex Change for Old Alma Mater

When the Massachusetts lnsti-
late of Technology adopted
"Arise Ye Sons of MIT" as its
alma mater in 1944. less than 3
percent of students were women.
No one seemed to calculate that
there might someday be many
MIT daughters. Today more
than 25 percent of the student
body is female. and the school
recently recalibrated its theme
song after some low-key lobbying
by alumni (and -nae). At MIT
president Paul Gray's request. a
faculty member (male) penned a
few line edits, including the some-
what inelegant conversion of
the rhyme “In loyal brother-
hood/Life is full and good“ to

 

"In loyal fellowship/Life is full
and rich.“ The engineers rang in
the new “Arise! All Ye of MIT“
last summer. Were the old grads
pleased? “There's the faction. of
course, that‘s not," says Joseph
Martori of the alumni associ-
ation, “but overall I think it was
received pretty well."

IThe University of Chicago——
which has always been coeduca-
tional and which has a woman
president—also put its alma mat-
er in the gender blender this
fall. Among other sexisms. the
closing line once asserted that
“truth shall make men free."
Edited version: “The truth shall
make us free.“

No news was great news last month for the staff of The
Daily Pennsylvanian. When a strike closed Philadelphia‘s
two major newspapers. student journalists at the University
of Pennsylvania responded with a “citywide” edition for
news-starved readers both on and off campus. University
news gave way to city. national and international stories on
the front page, and inside pages featured TV listings and
sports scores.

The expanded coverage gave reporters an opportunity to
