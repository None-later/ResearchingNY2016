An agent can also makea name by pulling
off a dramatic deal that sets the industry
buzzing. Russ Galen, a 31-year-old whiz
kid with the Scott Meredith Agency, recent-
ly did just that, auctioning off the rights to
Clay Blair‘s “Korea: America‘s Forgotten
War“ for $300,000. Galen, who also got
Times Books to sign up Blair‘s next book,
originally expected about $75,000 for “Ko-
rea.” “A fever pitch set in,“ Galen explains.
“It was like being at Sotheby‘s when the
momentum gets going."

Though agenting is ﬁrst and foremost a
business, few literary agents were drawn to
the ﬁeld by a love for the bottom line. “I
don't know anyone who went into any as-
pect of publishing because they were
interested in business,“ says Cynthia Can-
nell, 27, who handles foreign rights for
Janklow. “Most ofthem went into publish-
ing because they weren‘t." Nonetheless, she
adds, “you have to learn it to survive." To
do thejob well, adds Galen, an agent must
be a combination salesman, accountant and
contracts lawyer. “I have to be a business-
man or I'll get ﬁred,“ he says ﬂatly. “What
has surprised me is that I like it."

iking it is crucial, for as most suc-
l cessful agents tell it, representing
authors is more of a calling than a
career. Eric Ashworth, 27, a partner in the
small but prestigious Candida Donadio
Agency, is so serious about his job that he
lives just above the ﬁrm‘s ofﬁces in New
York's Chelsea district. “Other than my
family, I don‘t socialize with anyone who
isn‘t related to work,“ he says. The work, he
adds, is its own reward. “We represent good
books, serious books that will last. Candida
says, after 30 years as an agent, she feels like
she has a doctorate in 30 areas.“
In this age ofStephen King blockbusters

fully. “Writers will still need agents,“ he
‘ sttys, "so I‘m always going to have ajob."
4 Older hands agree. “With all the changes in
