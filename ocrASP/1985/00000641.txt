LIFE/STYLE

A football weekend is
one of America’s tribal
rites. From great dis-
tances come clanspeo-
ple young and old to
wear bright colors, eat
s'range aliments, drink
strong liquids and shout
incantations both wild
and arcane. Last month
NEWSWEEK ON CAMPUS assigned photogra-
phers to record the phenomenon in five of the
country’s most famous college towns: Athens,
Ga.; Champaign, 11].; Chapel Hill, NC; Colum-
bia, Mo., and Denton, Texas. (At the University
of Missouri, a group of 17 advanced photojour-
nalism students was set loose.)
