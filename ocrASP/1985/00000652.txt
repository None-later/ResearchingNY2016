A bona fide breakthrough in metal

most magnetic material there is, into a
super~small particle only 12 millionths of

This metal particle produces the
highest magnetic moment of any tape
we tested. Nearl twice as high as any
conventional hi ' bias tape—even
highert an pure metal, until

now the industry champ (see

lates into more head room.
Which means you can accur~
ately reproduce even the most
sudden bursts of high energy
sound that comes with the
most demanding music sources.
