paper can help you cope better with
your world each day.

If you're like most
Americans, you try to
keep up with the news by
watching it on television.

That’s how 65% of us
get 100% of our news—
from the 24—0dd-minute
TV news broadcast each
evening.

The problem—and I
know the frustration of it
firsthand — is that unless
something really special
happens, we in TV news
have to put severe time
limitations on every story,
even the most complicated and
.irnportant ones.

Get more than headlines

So what we bring you is primarily
a front—page headline service. To get
all you need to know, you have to
flesh out those headlines with a corn—
plete account of the news from a well—
edited and thorough newspaper.

Is it really necessary to get the
whole story? Dorothy Greene .
Friendly put it this way: “What the
American people don't know can
kill them." Amen.

News people have a respon—
sibility. And so do you. Ours is to
report the news fairly, accurately.
completely. Yours is to keep yourself
informed every day.

I'll never forget the quotation
hanging in Edward R. Murrow's
CBS ofﬁce. It was from Thoreau:
“It takes two to 5 weak the truth—
one to speak and one to hear."

Take a 3—minute overview

Here's how I tackle a paper. For
starters, I take a three—minute over—

\\"|‘u ‘ '-

view of the news. No need to go to
the sports section ﬁrst, or the TV
listings. With my overview you'll
get there quickly enough. First I
scan the front—page headlines, look
at the pictures and read the cap—
tions. I do the same thing age by
page front to back. Only I n do I
go back for the whole feast.

The way the front page is
“made up" tells you plenty. For one
thing, headline type size will tell
youhow the paper's editor ranks
the stories on relative importance.
A major crop failure in Russia
should get larger ty e than an over
turned truckload o wheat on the
Interstate, for example.

Which is the main story!

You'll find the main or lead story
in the farthest upper right—hand col—
umn. Why? Tradition. Newspapers
used to ap air on newsstands
folded an displayed with their top
right-hand quarter showing. They
made up the front page with the
lead story there to entice readers.

You‘ll ﬁnd the second most

left, unless it‘s related to
the lead story. Do you
have to read all the stories
in the pa er? Gosh, no.
But you s ould check
them all. Maybe the one
that appears at ﬁrst to be
the least appealing will be
the one that will most
affect your life.
News is information,
period
A good newspaper pro-
vides four basic ingredients
to elp you wrap your
mind around the news:
information, background.
analysis and interpretation.
Rule #1 of American
journalism is: “News columns
are reserved only for news."
What is news.7 It is informa—
tion only. You can tell a good news—
paper story. It just reports the news.
It doesn't try to slant it. And it
gives you both sides of the story.

Look out for a lot of adjectives
and adverbs. They don’t belong in
an objective news story. They tend
to color and slant it so you may
come to a wrong conclusion.

Do look for by-lines, datelines
and the news service sources of
articles. These will also help-you
judge a story's importance and its
facts.

As you read a story you can
weigh its truthfulness by asking
yourself, “Who said so?" book out
for “facts” that come from unnamed
sources, such as “a highly placed
govemment ofﬁcial.“ This could tip
you off that the story is not quite
true, or that someone — usually in
Washington -— is sending up a “trial
balloon” to see if something that
may happen or be proposed gets a
good reception.

Another tip: Check for “Cor-
rcctions" items. A good newspaper
will straighten out false or wrong
information as soon as it discovers

its error. A less conscientious one
\\ iii let it slide or bury it.

An upside—down pyramid
Reporters write news stories in
a special way called the “inverted
pyramid" style. That means they
start with the end, the climax of the
story, with the most important facts
first, then build in more details in
order of importance. This is unlike
the telling or writing of most sto-
ries, where you usually start at the
beginning and save the climax for
last. Knowing about the news—
)aper's “inverted pyramid" style will
ielp you sift facts.

A well—reported story will tell
ou "who," "what," "when,"
‘where" and “how.” The best news—
vipers will go on to tell you "why."
'\Vhy" is often missing. And that
my be the key ingredient.

Many important stories are
lanked by “sidebars.” These are
upporting stories that offer, not
iews, but the “why"— kground
ind analysis— to help you under—
rand and evaluate it.

Background offers hel ful facts.
Analysis frequently inclu es opin—
on. So it should be—and usually
Ls—carefully labeled as such. It's
'enerally by—lined by an expert on
he subject who explains the causes
"These are the kinds of
surrics you can ﬁnd on

of the news and its possible con—
sequences to you.

No good newspaper will mix
interpretation with “hard” news,
either. Interpretation goes beyond
analysis and tells you not just what
will probably happen, but what

ought to happen. This should be
clearly labeled, or at best, reserved
for the editorial page or “op—ed”
(opposite the editorial) page.

Form your own opinion ﬁrst

I fonn my own opinion before I
turn to the editorial page for the pun—
dits’ views. I don‘t want them to tell
me how to think until I’ve wrestled
the issue through to my own conclu—
sion. Once I have, I'm open to other
reasoning. Resist the temptation to let
them do your thinking for you.

Here's an idea I ﬁrmly believe
in and act on. When you read
something that motivates you, do
something about it. Learn more
about it. Join a cause. Write a let—
ter. You can constantly vote on

issues by writing letters, particularly
to your Congressman or state or
local representative.

To understand the news better
you can also read news magazines.
Books help ﬁll in the holes, too.
During the Vietnam war, for exam-
ple, many people felt that the daily
news coverage wasn’t entirely satis-
factory. The truth is, you could
have gotten many important new
facts on the war from the books
coming out at the time.

Pick a TV story and follow it

Now that I’ve told you about
the basics of getting under the skin
of a newspaper, let newspapers get
under your skin.

Tonight, pick an important sto—
ry that interests you on the TV
news. Dig into the story—— in your
newspaper. Follow it, and continue
to follow it closely in print. See if
you don't ﬁnd yourself with far more
understanding of the event.

And see if you don’t have a far
more sensible opinion as to the
“whys” and “wherefores” of that
event, even down to how it will
affect you—and maybe even what
should be done about it.

Keep up with the news the way
my colleagues and I do—on TV
and in the newspapers.

Leam to sift it for yourself, to
heft it, to value it, to question it, to
ask for it all. You’ll be in better con—
trol of your life and your fortunes.

And that’s the way it is.
