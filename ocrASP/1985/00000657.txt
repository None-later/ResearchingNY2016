The Blount Truths

Roy Blount Jr. is one of the funniest men itt America, and he
proves it every time he writes. But ask him to assess what he
does, and he begins to squirm. His face gets wrinkly. And you can
almost detect a little whine in his rich Georgia drawl. Then he
remembers a Chekhov story he read just a couple of days ago: “It
bespake a proverb—‘My elbow is near but I cannot kiss it.‘ Well, I
certainly cain’t kiss or chew on whatever my writing might be."
In other words, Roy Blount Jr. is too close to what he writes to
analyze it. Truth be told, be pretty much is what he writes, or, at
least, what he writes is what he thinks. His subjects are his interests
and obsessions; his style is as natural as the way he talks. Over the
course of ﬁve books, including the brand-new anthology "Not
Exactly What I Had in Mind” (TheAtlamic Mortthlyl’ress, $14. 95),
Blount has bespoken uncommon common sense with an earthy,
mischievous tang. His reputation is such that people compare him
with the likes ofH. L. Mencken and W. C. Fields. Some folks have
even put him in theCurmudgeon Hall ofFame next to Mark Twain.
Like his idols Twain, Robert Benchley and James Thurber,
Blount started out in journalism. After earning degrees in English
from Vanderbilt (B.A.) and Harvard (M.A.) and serving in the
Army for two years, he worked for the Atlanta Journal from I966
to 1968. He then made the jump into magazine journalism,
spending seven years at Sports Illustrated before plunging into the
free-lance world. He has since written for an astonishing array of
publications—Cosmopoiitan, Eastern Airlines Pastime, The New
Yorker and GO, to name a small fraction. At 44, he now lives in
Massachusetts with his second wife, his high-school-senior son (a

, daughter attends Stanford), two dogs, two cats and two chickens.
! He had to give away the rooster because it wouldn't let him out of
the house.

“I’ve always wanted to get to the point where people wanted me
to write the way I wanted to write," says Blount. "It took a long
time.” But now magazines like GQ come sniiﬁng at him all the time
with story ideas that he can take or leave. If he comes up with an idea
his own self, The Atlantic is dying to hear about it. Asked on the
spot, Blount cannot think of something he couldn’t, or wouldn’t,
write about: “People will call me up and say, ‘Do something about
testicles,’ and I‘ll start collecting articles." A tireless clipper, Blount
will sometimes save up stuff while waiting for the chance to write
about a particular subject. He has had ﬁles on Juniors, for an
obvious reason, as well as on Hands, Hats and Hopelessness.

v aried interests? You bet. Just check out his new book. It
contains tips on how to get into a fancy restaurant (becoming
the chef and dressing like Michael Jackson, to name two), some
wicked observations on our current president (“Ronald Reagan is
the most widely beloved American since Bambi, and I have trouble
believing he exists") and a deﬁnitive list of what makes a woman
sexy (No. 35:"Oneoftltose T-shirts with the big, big armholes. You
know what I mean? You keep hoping the ﬂag will come along and
she‘ll salute. Of course I realize that from a respect-for-women
point of view those shirts are worn only for purposes of mobility and
air-conditioning. Uh-huh.").

“Not Exactly What I Had in Mind," like his last three books,
combines outright humor, anti-self-help articles, sardonic com-
mentary and irregular journalism. Despite the diversity of this
material, the book holds together because of Blount's intelligence
and purpose. Not that he thinks in straight lines; he once described
himself as a person who is “confused but [has] visionary ﬂashes
Occasionally.“ But you always know what he's up to, and you have a
good time, and you learn something. Besides, Roy Blount Jr.
doesn't believe things to be straight and conventional: “The truth is
that things don’t have to obey certain laws. Not only don‘t they have
to, even if they had to, they wouldn't."

What’s Wit This Fall

And that’s not all, folks.

There's a lot more good hu-
mor coming your way. Here are
three books to memorize and
quote mercilessly to friends.

In “Elementary Education"
(Knopf? $14.95), Mark O'Don;
nell brings Diderot’s Encyclope-
dic kicking and screaming into
the 20th century. O‘Donnell, a
former “Saturday Night Live"
and Harvard Lampoon writer,
lurches through the universe of
knowledge—from engineering
(“How Things That Don‘t Exist
Work") to nuclear science
(“Einstein Made Even Easier")
to shop (“Building the Bomb on
aBudget”). He presents an intel-
ligent guide to the physics of
cartoons, including the Modi-
ﬁed Law of Gravity: “Daffy
Duck steps off a cliff, expecting
further pastureland. He loiters

 

in midair, soliloquizing ﬂip-
pantly, until he chances to look
down. At this point, the familiar
principle of 32 feet per second

is encyclopedic, then “The His-
tory of White People in Amer-
ica" is a monograph. Based on
the cable~TV specials by Martin
Mull and Allen Rucker, “Hist0<
ry” (Perigee. $5. 95) cuts to the
quick of those who are, uh,
colorless—or maybe pinkish—
and as bland as, well, white
bread. Their anthropological
examination leads them to
white artifacts (decorative re-
frigerator magnets, the semi-
personal family form letter at
Christmas), white lies (“We
waited until we were married"),
white food (“Large Molded
Jell~0 Bunny"), etc. Readers
will learn how to judge how an-
gry a white woman really is by
her curses. “Oh, fudge!" for ex-
ample, connotes only mild an-
ger. Medium anger, however,
will bring, “Lord grant me the
wisdom to change the things
that I can change, accept the
things that I can‘t change, and

 

to know the difference. Amen."

White people themselves can
be funny. Take Bob and Ray.
Please. “The New! Improvedl
Bob & Ray Book" (Putnamfs.

humor from Bob Elliott-and

White: A ﬁery solo effort from Mr. Earth, Wind and Fire

A Pop Master
Goes It Alone

You may not know his
name. You may not even rec-
ognize his face. But you have
heard—and very likely danced
to—music that Maurice White
has sung and/or written and/
or produced. Best known as the
founder and leader of Earth,
Wind and Fire, White has a
long and successful history in
pop music. He was a session
drummer at the legendary
Chess Records behind such

- blues greats as Muddy Waters

and Howlin' Wolf. He wrote,
produced and played jazz for

. the Ramsey Lewis Trio. He has
'j produced gold records for sev-

eral black pop acts, including

: the Emotions and Deniece Wil-

liams. And, most recently, he
produced three songs for Bar-

. bra Streisand. Now, at the age
' of4l, Maurice White has come

up with his ﬁrst solo album. It
may seem overdue, after 22

' years in the music business, but

the explanation for the delay is

' really very simple. “I didn't

ltuve the time,“ says While.
“I‘ve been touring or produc-

i ing a record for the last nine

nttd one-half years.“

 

In fact, White only got some
spare time because—after 15
years,severalpersonnelchanges
and nearly 20 million albums
sold—the members of Earth,
Wind and Fire have taken a
break. White promises that, de-
spite the solo success of Philip
Bailey with “Easy Lover" and
now White with “Stand By
Me," EW&F will regroup next
fall. In the meantime, says
White, “it‘s been wonderful to
have the freedom to work with
other people.“ Not that the
music on the solo album, called
“Maurice White," represents
much of a departure from the
propulsive mix of funk, Latin
and gospel that earned EW&F
six double-platinum albums
(2 million copies sold), two
platinum albums (1 million
sold) and three gold albums
(500,000 sold). “Switch On
Your Radio" has catchy poly-
rltythms just as the EW&F
megabit “Shining Star" did.
And, while the solo record
doesn‘t use a horn section, syn-
thesizers serve up the melodic
and rltythmic counterpunclt
that brass docs for EW&F. Ac-
tually, it shouldn’t bcsurprising
that “Maurice White“ delivers
the saute smoldering funk attd
sweet soul; White produced all
