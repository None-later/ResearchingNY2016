write nearly all the songs.

White has always been funky
without being downbeat. Many
ofthe songs on his album have
an uplifting quality, like “Be-
lieve in Magic“: “Hey, you can
touch the sky/Got to reach for
more/That's what dreams are
for.“ S' ys White, "I would say
I'm positive about 80 percent
of the time, and I'd like it to
be 05 percent. I believe in mir-
acles and all that." The songs
are not preachy. however, and
the lyrics never get in the way
ofthe groove. When you listen
to his music, you can tell where
Maurice White has hecii. “I go
in many different directions at
the same time.“ he says. “I'm
pulling together all my experi-
ences to be a jazz musician. a
blues musician, a gospel singer,
a rhythm-and-blues performer.
l‘m fulfilling all those aspira-
tions at the same time."

places. The sensational video—
a dazzling mix ofanimation and
live action—for their hit single,
“Take On Me," takes full ad-
vantage of their Nordic good
looks. In fact, they‘re so video-
genic that when lead singer
Morten Harket, 26, gets mussed
and sweaty at the end of the clip
he still looks like a male model.
And so do guitarist and key-
boardist Pal Waaktaar, 24, and
keyboardist Mags, 23.

The music on a-ha‘s alb m
“Hunting High and Low“ is
nearly as attractive as they are.
“Take On Me“ exempliﬁes the
group at its peppy, syncopated
best. The lyrics aren‘t much,
but who needs words when
you‘re trying to dance? And
that‘s the crux of a-ha‘s appeal;
when the synthesizer's tempo is
hot, so is the band. When the
music slows down—as with
“The Sun Always Shines on
T. ‘——you begin to notice the
wor s. Only occasionally do
the lyri ' sparkle, as in “The
Blue Sky," when Harket sings,
“I used to be confused/But
now [just don‘t know."

Dodwell exploring the Waghi: First anthropology, then adventure

River Voyages
Of Discovery

In the “civilized” world, riv-
ers have lost much of their im—
portance. Supplanted by auto-
mobiles, trains and airplanes,
waterways neither function as
primary avenues of transport
nor dictate the centers of popu-
lation and industry. But, as a
new PBS series demonstrates
with vivid detail, there are still
places where rivers determine
how people live and whether
societies ﬂourish. “River Jour-
neys," a six-part series which
begins in early November, fol-
lows six different writers as
they travel six very different
rivers. Some are famous: the
Nile, the Congo, the Mekong.
Others are relatively obscure:
the Waghi in New Guinea, Rio
Sio Francisco in Brazil atid the
Murray in Australia.

Each of the writers was given
a simple assignment: find a river
that promises adventure or in-
trigue. The premiere, showing

edge razor blades as a rite of

pates, allowing a diamond-
shaped pattern—modeled after
one found on the forehead of
crocodiles—to be cut into her
left shoulder. Then she joins a
team of American river rafters
in a dangerous attempt to navi-
gate the Waghi, a torrential and
rocky waterway that had never
been traversed by whites. Final-
ly, after the rafts have tipped
over a number of times, the par-
ty decides that their mission is
hopeless. After one drenching,
Dodwell observes, “I was
soaked and shaken. I‘d been
