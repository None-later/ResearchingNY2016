NEWS EDITOR

Students will be able to drink alcoholic
beverages on campus if they are of legal .
drinking age after December 1. at least if
the recommendations of the “Implementa- '
tion of 21" Committee hold any weight in-

the matter.
The committee voted unanimously. zero

 

to ten. against making the University a ' :

“dry” campus, according to. the final
'report of the group.

The report was made public by Student
Association President Steve Gawley Mon-

day . Officially, however, the report can be 7

released only by Vice President for Student

Affairs Frank Pogue, who is out of town ' _.

for the week.

celebrates its fifteenth as a family

Family reunions are a time for joy and
reflection, but the one that occurred Sun-
day at the Thruway House was a bit dif-
ferent. Generations of ageweren’t the ones
celebrating, it was generations of student
activists.

Student Association of the State Univer-
sity (SASU) members and alumni had
gathered for brunch and to close SASU’s
15th Anniversary Conference, which took
place at SUNYA over the weekend.

"I think the SASU family is the best
family in the world," said Libby Post.
who worked with SASU in 1977 as Media
Director.

15 years ago. students from several
SUNY campuses decided to unite to in-
crease their power and representation. To-
day. SASU plays a significant role in in-
volving students in the decision-making
processes of New York State.

A key figure in the founding of SASU
was Ray Glass, who was killed by a
drunken driver in October 1975. Many
former members of SASU remelnbered

«9.01355 as they spoke at an Alumni panel at

the brunch.

Danny Kohane, who was President of
SASU from 1974-1975, described Glass as
dedicated. committed. and intense. in
February of l972, SASU held their first
conference, and, remembered Kohano,
“Ray kept us locked in a hotel room for
two weeks teaching us how to be
lobbyists."

“Ray turned. students into profes-
sionals." said Mitchell Edelstein, a former
SASU legislative Director who now works
with Americans for Democratic Action, a
political advocacy group.

TANIA STIILI UPS

Former SASU President Jim Tierney spoke Sande

Remembering the victories. disappointments, and humor of student activism

Sunday's brunch was also a time for
reminiscing about past student victories.

“One of the things that keeps us coming
back is that it's fun to get together and
relive the memoriei." said Bdelstein.
“You remember the good times and the
victories and forget the bad," he added.
Jim Tierney. who served as SASU's presi-
dent i‘rom 983-1984 reminded present
SASU members of a need for optimism.

“Sometimes your plans just don't click.”
he said, “like when only six people show
up for a rally. Other times you get a very
rewarding and unexpected response, like
when 35,000 people show up for a rally."
But Tierney also remembered the need
for a sense of humor, “like the time Torn
Swan shaved off half my board." Tom
Swan was SASU ‘Vice President from

of bulk containers: kegs and beer balls, in
the report.

The report says the committee voted 8-2
to permit single beer balls in suites, but
tied 5-5 on the issues of two beer balls or a
quarter-keg. And the committee voted
against allowing half-kegs in dorms by 4-6.

“There’s no logic to voting 8-2 to permit
a beer ball and voting against a keg,"
Gawley stated, adding “it’s more of a con-
cern for overcompensation."

“A ban on a half-keg as opposed to a
quarter-keg as opposed to a beer ball is a
symbolic way of saying “we're concern-
ed" about excess drinking, said Gawley.

Gawley added that kegs should be allow-
ed because it is easier to judge how much a
person has drunk from a keg than in shots
of hard liquor or from mixed drinks.
“They're trying to make a symbolic state-
ment," he reiterated.

“All this is preliminary," however. said
Gawley, because Pogue can make any
recommendation he desires to University
Council. “1 would say Vice President
Pogue is going to take to University Coun-
cil as reasonable a policy as he can," he
added.

“If you read the first page of the report
you got the feeling that it’s in favor of a
reasonable alcohol policy," Gawley said,
referring to the reconunendation.

“What we advocated against was having
the word ‘no’ in the policy." he added. El

Educators hail
Higher Ed. Act
as milestone

Washington, D. C.
COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE -- The biggest
college news of October 20, 1965 seemed
to be a wild press conference held by the
then-obscure Students for a Democratic
Society, which called for a civilian alter-
native to the draft amid heated refusals
to say whether it was a communist
group.

Two decades later, it is clear an event
of equal significance to American higher
education was taking place that same
day a few blocks away at the Capitol,
where Congress was approving an
almost-ignored piece of landmark
legislation.

“Although it did not get the attention
it should have when it was passed, the
Higher Education Act of 1965 establish-
ed higher education as a national priori-
ty." said American Enterprise institute
researcher Terry Hartle.

Now, even as Congress debates
changing the all-important act many
educators around the country are
preparing to celebrate the 20th anniver-
sary of the law that revolutionized
American higher education.

Most educators feel they have plenty
to celebrate.

The act invented most kinds of stu-
dent aid, made it possible to educate
most of America's middle and portions
of its lower economic classes, and
transformed many US. colleges into
knowledge supermarkets.

While other observers charged the act
fostered unwanted changes as well. fans
of the Higher Education Act aren't shy
about promoting it.

“it's the foundation for federal
higher education laws. Virtually
