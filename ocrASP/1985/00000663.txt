$90,000 deficit forces Statesman
to cut back publication schedule

By Jim Avery
STAFF WRITER

The SUNY system’s only three
times a week paper, the
Statesman of Stony Brook, has
been forced to cut back its
publication schedule due to a
$90,000 deficit.

The Statesman was last printed
on October 10 when the 25 year
old paper announced, due to
financial difficulties, it may have
to cancel certain issues.

George Biderman, a 23 year old
senior who is the editor in chief
and an English major at Stony
Brook said, “We've proved we
can survive on a week to week
basis." In explanation of the cur-
rent difficulty, he said. simply,
“We have a back debt.”

The blow which forced the
Statesman to stop publishing
came, according to Biderman,
when the paper’s printer, the
Three City Herald, refused to ex—
tend credit after two checks totall-
ing $1,752 bounced.

“We have brought in $2.100
from Polity [SUNY Stony
Brook’s Student Government],
Money they owed us in advertis-
ing, $1,000 which was ap-
propriated by the Graduate Stu-
dent Organization and $1.300
from Suffolk Community College
for putting out their paper, ‘The
Compass'," said Biderman. ad—
ding. “We have $16,700 due to us
from local advertisers alone. Next
week we‘re doing billing for na-
tional advertisors like A.T.&T.
and the Army." .

Frederick Preston, Stony
Brook Vicc'President for Student
Affairs. has advised the
Statesman to cut back on the
number of times it publishes.
However, Biderman said. “Cut-
ting down on the issues means less
ads and future revenue
problems.”

Until 1983 Polity bought 8,000
copies of each issue at a rate of
$7.50 per subscription which
yielded $60,000 in revenues a
year. “They would give
Statesman a payment up front."
said Biderman.

The arrangement was ended in
1983. leaving the Statesman whol-
ly dependent on advertising

revenue. All other student
organizations. according to
Biderman, receive Polity funds,
he said, adding, “The Statesman
is the only organization on cam-
pus which Polity does not run.”

 

 

According to Bill Fox, Advisor
to Polity President Eric Levine,
the Statesman has always had
problems with Polity. “The Ad—
ministration in ’82-’83 did not
like the editorial comments and
froze the Statesman [budget].
They would simply stop checks."
he said.

“There was $12,000 that was to
be allocated for the Statesman.
The Senate and Councilmen
voted to give themselves sipends
for $12,000," said Mitchell
Horowitz, the paper‘s Managing
Editor, adding. “Strings of finan-
cial coincidences like that were
common."

Our plan for financial stability
is to take one dollar off the Stu-
dent Activity Fee each semester.
Biderman estimates this would
raise $24,000 a year which would
be available at the beginning of
the school year and would cover
costs until advertising revenue
begins to flow. The plan,
however. required a two-thirds
majority vote of approval in a
general election. Last spring, the
Statesman received a 65.9 percent
approval and 63.5 percent again
in October of this year. Horowitz

   

   

   

was quoted in the October 10
Statesman as blaming the referen-
dum’s failure on “ignorance.
stupidity, and apathy” on the
part of the students.

Biderman stressed that with ad
money coming in, the paper can
survive on a week to week basis
and began paying off its $90,000
back debt. “If Polity would put is
million dollar organization
behind us. we could work out a.
plan with our creditors," he said.

There are three other student
papers on the Stony Brook cam-
pustBlackworld, which Statesman
staff said publishes at best once
every three weeks; Shining Star,
which has yet to publish this
semester; and the Stony Brook
Press, which has had its budget
frozen by Polity.

“The Press put out a blank
issue as a protest of Polity’s ac-
tions,“ said Bidcrman. According
to Fox, the Press has been un-
frozen and promises regular
weekly editions. “The Statesman
has been frozen [in the past]
because of what they printed. The
Press was frozen for what they
did not print," said Biderman.

The Statesman plans to be
available this Wednesday. though
Biderman said Friday’s issue may
be missed, bringing to eight the
number of editions not printed
this year.

found that 5] percent of the women at both

“The late seventies were definitely the height

Now Gerrard has released the results of her

sexual activity seems to have declined.

Hartle asserted. _

The official ceremonies com~
memorating the 20th anniversary
of the act are scheduled for Nov.

Texas State University, where

President Lyndon Johnson signed
the bill into law in 1965 as part of
his Great Society program.

“The Higher Education Act
was a human initiative, enriching
the lives of millions of young men
and women," said Robert
Hardesty, then a Johnson
speechwriter and today Southwest

Texas State's president.

Not everyone agrees. Critics see
the Higher Education Act as a no-
ble effort that has spiraled
beyond control. making schools
dependent on federal handouts
and undermining educational
quality.

“A great many campuses have

got themselves a dependency pro-

Education Department ofﬁcial
Chester Finn said before he join—
ed the federal agency this past
summer. “Threaten to reduce
their doses of student aid funds,
and they start to sweat and cramp

Johnson, though, saw the act
