Women’s conference reps. share impressions

Women attending Saturday's workshop

A “very anti-imperialistic and anti-militaristic" conference.

       

By Colleen Deslaurler

A women’s conference last July which was at-
tended by over 18,000 women from around the
world prompted differing opinions from two
American representatives who spoke out in front of
a group of 25 on campus Saturday.

Gwendolyn Rogers, staff psychologist at the
Center for Women’s Development for Black Gays
and Heather McAnn Student Association of the
State University (SASU) campus coordinator at
SUNY Plattsburgh, talked about their impressions
as well as the specific issues that they represented at
the Conference held in Nairobi, Kenya.

McAnn and Rogers showed a 30 minute
videotape of the Nairobi conference, which was at-
tended by women from different countries speaking
on issues like health care, higher education for
native Americans in the United States, and labor
manipulation in Malaysia and the Philiipines.

According to Rogers. who disagreed with the way
in which-the videotape was presented there were
many banners hanging on the walls protesting he
South African aprtheid movement, which the
videotape did not show.

The South African press conference and illegal
demonstrations on the campus were also missing
from the videotape. “There was no feeling of how
‘biack' the conference really was. There was a dif-
ference of perspective shown,” she said.

McAnn focused instead on the plight of the
Palestinian people. After World War I, the Palesti-
nian people were promised their independence, she
said, adding that at the same time. the Zionists were
promised that Palestine would be left to them as
their “homeland.”

The Palestinians “were forced out of their coun-
try by the legislature and violent acts by the
Zionists." she said, adding that the majority of
Palestinians were forced to settle in refugee camps.

According to McAnn. Palestinian women were
"doubly exploited. Not only were they denied their
country and homeland," she said, “but they were
also products of the traditional lslamic society
which made them take second place to the men.”

Most of the families in the camps encouraged
women to get jobs and to join the military. said
McAnn. However, she added. the nation also wants

to “hold on to its identity” and to keep thewomen
in their traditional roles 'of staying in the home.

"On the one hand,” McAnn said, -"‘Paiestine
says to join the work force andbecome educated;
while on the other hand, it wants the women to stay
in their former roles. The women are then tom bet-
ween two forces. both leading to the goal of achiev-
ing liberation on the national level.”

“Many women, even the educated ones, are now
saying. first let's liberate the country, and attain na-
tional liberation, later we'll worry about our pro-
blems of social liberation,” McAnn said.

The Nairobi conference was “very anti-
imperiaiistic and anti-militaristic" said Rogers.

“We came back (to the US.) much more militant '

and with a genuine concept of self-determination,"
she added.

“There were two hot issues that needed to be
brought out — the need for the new world informa-
tion order and a statement on lesbian solidarity,"
Rogers said.

At one point in the Nairobi conference, the
women who attended gathered for a unity rally, ac-
cording to Rogers. ‘ ‘One African woman came over
to us afterwards, with tears streaming down her
face — thanking us for our courage on this mat~
ter," said Rogers.

There was “a genuine sisterhood” at Nairobi,
said Rogers. “We realized that the struggle for
sisterhood and Nationalism is one. We wre there ot
challenge the boundaries of our lives," she added.

Both Rogers and McAnn agreed that one major
issue of the conference was the idea of peace. which
included, “not just the absence of war, but also the
issues that cause war." Rogers said.

“The conference defined equality in a com-
prehensive way. We realized that the struggle for
sisterhood can't be separated," roger said. “This
concept gave the UN Decade‘s conference much
more meaning. We came back much clearer on
what needed to be done.” she added. 1

Alyson Reed, a Women’s Caucus Delegate from
SUNY Binghamton said the workshop was “really
great, because we were presented with radical view-
points. (The speakers) also stressed color to a

predominantly white group, which exposed us to
El :

different ideas." she said. a

“We see things are
' ' Wrong, and we'want'
0‘ to do something '
about them. ”
,— Dorothy Cotton

 

praise of student Victories 

By Lou DlFablo

.. til
About 60 representatives from the Stir-g

dent Association of the: State University
(SASU) campuses across the state en.-
thusiastically welcomed Dorothy Cotton, a
civil rights activist, as the keynote speaker
at SASU’s 15th anniversary conference
Friday. . _ .

Cotton, who spent 13 years working in
the civil rights movement with Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr.. currently serves as Direc-
tor of. Student Activities at Cornell
University.

Cotton addressed' the SUNY student
leaders with warmth and a strong sense of
community, opening her remarks with an
emotional and soulful rendition of “Com-
baya.” The song always helped solidify
and unify groups she was involved with.
she said, quoting an African proverb, “the
Spirit that rules the universe does not des-
cend until the people have sung."

Cotton praised the' efforts and
achievements won by SASU, and attacked
claims that today's students are apathetic.
“Look what you have done combating the

r cutting of financiai.aid...in gaining student

voter registration rights, and in. your
glorious“victory in' divestiture of SUNY
funds in Apartheid South Africa." she
said. ‘ - .
Cotton made a comparison between the’

_ Civil Rights movement of the 60's and the

- “We ‘see things are wrong, and We want to
doso'rnething about them," she said. ‘
‘ There is a great deal a sociaitaCtivist group
like-SASU can leafh from Martin Luther

King. Jr., Cotton said, adding that there
were “very few people working initially (in
the Civil Rights movement)....We kept at
it and were able to rearrange the social
order of this country. I hope you take
courage in that.” « '

There is a need for good leadership ih
achieving an organization's goals. stressed‘
Cotton. “Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. rose
to the occasion...he came from petty apar-
theid in Birmingham, Aiabama...and Dr.
King became head of the organization to
ﬁght that particular situation...He was so
right for that job." she asserted.

Cotton identified the distinction bet-
ween “petty apartheid" in the American
South during the '605 and apartheid in
South Africa, explaining that in South
Africa there are absolutely no civil rights.

Cotton said she sympathized with the
difficulties student leaders face in their ef-
forts to.organize a large group of in-
dividuals and‘she recalied"many of the pro-
blems King confronted ‘ in attempts to
unify the Black population of the ’605.

Quoting from an old blues song, Cotton
sang, “i been down so long, down don’t
bother me no more." According to Cot-
ton, students must fight this sentini'er‘1'6‘>

 

stand SASU has taken in fighting inl'ustice.

A workshop titled “Feminism in the
Eighties" turned into a round table
discussion of women's issues at cam-.
puses across the SUNY system Saturday
morning.

The workshop was part of the Student
Association of the State University‘s
(SASU) Fifteenth Anniversary
Conference.

Carrie Borowitz a co-chair of SASU's
Women's Caucus from SUNY Buffalo.
said she feels that women should assume
leadership roles. “They have to develop
as role models, with wanting to become
leaders. They need conﬁdence and they
have to be willing to make and accept

changes. They should have a say in the
decision making processes."

The workshop was moderated by
Borowitz and her co-chair on the
Women’s Caucus. Amy Barker, a stu-
dent at Oneonta College.

At the meeting, most women seemed
to agree that the definition of a
“feminist” is someone who sees ine-
qualities towards women and is willing
to work to change them. Sheor he does
not necessarily have to be active but
must be able to express the unfairness to
others.

“A feminist does not have, to be a
woman. Men have to be educated as
well as other women.” said one partici-
pant. A man can be considered a

that women should be able to be what
' they want to be and that there is a need
' for it. i

"There is always a need for women to
assert themselves. They should be‘
positively assertive. rather than being
aggressive or angry," another woman

“Feminism is basically being what
you want to be in your life. if you want
to be a housewife then you should' be
one." said one SASU delegate attending

The participants agreed there is an im-
portance and need for women's centers
on campuses and also that feminist
issues need to be addressed.

“At SUNY Purchase, we have a
women’s center which works with other
clubs at the school,".said one 00110113.
