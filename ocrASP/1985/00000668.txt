Greenpeace uses simple means

By Dan Happ

While other Greenpeace members use
publicity stunts to make headlines around
the world, the SUNYA support group
organizers use simple methods to bring
their message to the university community.

With offices in 18 countries and almost
1.5 million members world-wide,
Greenpeace is one of the largest non-profit
environmentalist organizations in
existence.

“The non-violent direct action tactics
that most people know Greenpeace for are
really just a small part of their operations,
mainly to get publicity,” said Stuart
Cohen, who is one of four members of
Greenpeace’s support group at SUNYA.
“Once they've gotten people’s attention,
have more people on their side, and have
gained the supoport they need, then they
can lobby for the passage of laws and
changes in legislation, which is the impor-
tant part," he added.l

Greenpeace began a support group at
SUNYA after the idea proved successful at
schools in Ithaca, Rochester,'and New
Hampshire. A meeting here last year deter-
mined that there was sufﬁcient interest
from students to establish a support
group.

According to Cohen. while the main
reason for having a supprt group on cam-
pus is to raise funds for Greenpeace
through the sale of merchandise like tee-
shirts, buttons. and bumper stickers on
campus. Greenpeace tabling serves other
purposes as well.

“With an annual budget of $15 milion,
fund-raising, of course, is a large and
necessary part of us being here on campus.
That's how Greenpeace works.” said
Cohen. Both coordinators recive a 10 per-
cent commission on all sales made as
salary.

Cohen added, "it‘s also an excellent op-
portunity for us to reach out to the

SUNYA community, and the main way for
someone to get to know what Greenpeace
is all about is through the tables}? The
support group not only sells things at the
table: it provides information, offers peti-
tions and mailing lists, and creates a
general awareness of Greenpeaces’s
activities. -
Greenpeaces's activities encompass far
more than the publicity stunts Greenpeace

Swan spoke about issues that are of par-
ticular importance to sudents today. “To-
day we are under attack in every area," he
said. “Education is no longer education
but vocational training which prepares

students for the competitive job market.“

“There exists an educational elite," said
Swan “in which only those students who
can afford to pay for it themselves are
allowed to attend universities. We have to
ﬁght tuition increases, financial aid cuts
and shifts toward loans instead of grants.”

Swan also spoke about “Draft By

‘ Need,” when students are forced to join a
branch of the military because they cannot
afford an education.

“One thing which will remain a constant
is that our number one focus is to
guarantee every citizen of New York State
the right to an education. regardless of
their economic status," said current SASU
president Jane McAlevey. “We are going
to continue to fight to keep tuition costs
down.”

The oldest president at the brunch was
Brian Pertraitis, who served from

1973-1974. “Every generation of students .

has a right to define and organize their
issues as they see fit,” he said. “I’m not
here to tell new members what their agen-
da should be."

“We have to work on the trend of get-

uses to gain attention, and include impor-

_ tant educational devices such as speaker's

forums, films and slideshows,-'and interest
meetings, all of which will be brought to
campus, according to Cohen.

The SUNYA support group is trying to
institute a recycling project at the quads,

“It's time for students to remember that
student politics shouldn't become a social
function. There is an ongoing dedication:

in SASU that is being handed.;down,

generation to generation, year totyear,"
Post added. “What we’re doing is impor-
tant because it does empower students."

“It’s important to keep this momentum
going because students are so transient,
but with SASU the wheel never stops turn-
ing, it just keeps rolling along.” she
continued.

“We're more professional and more

respected now. because of v a growing

member of Greenpeace, or just by signing
up for their mailing list. '

So far. Cohen and Nunnberg said, the
response from‘students has been excellent.

“We have almost 20 pages of people
signed up for our mailing list, a lot of
volunteers, and people helping out in other
ways, said Nunnberg, ‘..‘and we’re just get-

lot of campus unrest. Students then realiz-
ed the need for a centralized force, not
power, that could be capable of making
necessary change," said Kohane.

“From a campus perspective, there has
been a need in the past and there still is a
need for a professional organization that
can advocate students’ rights,” said Frank
Jackalone. who was SASU president from
1976-1977.” .

Jackalone was a key ﬁgure in the crea—
tion of USSA and saw the organization as
a great victory in the history of building a
national student movement. He also noted
that three of USSA's five presidents came
from SASU.

“We are carrying Ray Glass’ torch,”
said Ja'ckalone. “We have to make sure we
can maintain a strong education with
values that will effect everyone in the state
of New York." - 1
