Chanowitz sees Jewish wbmen as
being different butequal to men

By Colleen Deslaurler

Jewish women are not inferior to men as
many of the “Western world" are led to
believe, according to Esther Chanowitz,
who spoke on “Women and Judaism,”
Tuesday night.

Relying on various books on the subject,
Chanowitz said she strives to inform
students of the misconceptions concerning
Jewish women. She said she aims to
educate people on the position of Jewish
women today.

Women are “different, but equal," said
Chanowitz. Explaining her point, she said
women sit apart from men in the
synagogue. In this way, neither are
distracted by the opposite sex and may
concentrate more on their prayers, which
is their purpose in the synagogue, she said.

Women are better equipped to teach
children in the home said Chanowitz. ex-
plaining, “Judaism begins at home. If you
educate a woman, then you educate a
family and a nation."

Another participant from Purchase
added, “the women’s center is run by
faculty of the womens studies program.
the faculty is active and a womens union
was started last semester."

At SUNY Binghamton, among other
projects, “we are trying to facilitate a
child care facility,” said one
participant.

Another student from Binghamton
added, "In the past few years they
(women) have become a strong, viable
force on campus. They have worked to
improve lighting on campus.” '

“At Oneonta,” said one represen-
tative, “they are selling whistles for one
dollar to help women feel more secure.
We also have a self-defense workshop.”

The leaders of the discussion went

To enforce her statement, Chanowitz
asked, “Which is more important, my
right hand or my left?” She answered,
“both are equally needed. In the same
way, the Jewish couple must learn and live
together to form a well-balanced
community.”

Chanowitz said she hoped to convey to
students to “think Jewish.” the Western
world, she said, sees only “the synagogue
and the role men play in it. Women have
their own heritage, which must be searched
and brought up."

Women have an equally important role
in the Jewish community as men, said
Chanowitz, explaining that it is women
who light the candles before the Sabbath.

Chanowitz’s speech was sponsored by
“The Flame,” a branch of SUNYA’s
Jewish Student Coalition (J SC). which
deals with traditional Jewish education
and issues involving the Jewish communi-
ty.

around the room and asked people what
was the first word which came to mind
when the word "feminism" was said.
Contributions included: people, equali-
ty, rights, militant, encompassing, uni-
ty, man-hater and change. Three people
said "radical" and three people said
“women.”

Women and men should get together
to beat the problem of feminism, sug-
gested one woman, saying, “People get
bad ideas and think they’re radical. But,
they’re really not, always. Women just
try to stick up for their rights.”

“Sexism has to be challenged.
Women have to learn to take initiative
and not to be afraid. if no one does
anything about it. they will never be
found out or challenged,” said another.

OLLEGE PRESS SERVICE— Despite some

egative input from a college president last

eek. Congress seems ready to pass a law

orcing most college programs to treat
ale and female students equally.

The bill, called the Civil Rights Restora-
ion Act, would overrule a 1984 U.S.
upreme Court decision that excu'sed

any college departments from having to
ledge not to discriminate against women.

But some administrators and apparently
ome students as well worry the measure
the federal government
“interfere” in campus programs.

“It sounds like a new fear to me," said
congressional aide Kris McManiman. “We

~ get students calling up from Baptist col-

leges asking if (they’re) going to have to
room with a man.” . _
“We want to protect our in
dependence,” Charles MacKenzie, presi-
dent of Grove City College (Pa), told

Congress in a hearing last week. “The

. government at some point may want to im-

 

pose their secular values on our campus.”

The bill’s sponsors say they only want to
give college women a legal tool with which
to challenge discrimination, which a court
— not the government -— would then treat.

Last week's hearings only continued a
debate that began when Congress approv-
ed Title IX of the Higher Education
Amendments of 1972. Title IX, of course,
bars colleges that take federal money from
discriminating on the basis of gender.

Many women’s groups say Title lX pro—
vided the legal tool to open admissions to
certain degree programs to women, gain
more resources for female students’
schoilarship programs, and even funnel
money into women's sports teams and
facilities.

Several schools — the University of
Richmond, Hillsdale College and Grove
City College among them — have gone to
court to escape the law.

They've argued Title lX should not
cover whole colleges, but only programs
that get or use the federal government's
money. Grove City asserted the govern—
ment simply should leave campus pro-

grams to campus administrators to run.

“We did not want to accept the principle
of federal jurisdiction," MacKenzie told
Congress last week.

It was Grove City's legal challenge to the
jurisdiction that made it to the Supreme
Court last year. The court ruled Title IX
applied only to programs that directly got
federal money, not to all programs on a
campus that took some kind of federal aid.

The court added, however, that campus
student aid offices would have to comply
with Title IX because they administer
federal funds.

Various women's and congressional
groups were angered by the ruling. “It's
completely absurd that women can only be
protected in specific programs and
buildings on campus," said Kristin Stelck.
a lobbyist for the National Association of
University Women.

Stelck said the ruling makes it harder for
female students to pursue their rights.

Soon after the ruling, for example, the
civil rights office of the Department of
Education dropped the case of a student

who officially complained she‘d been sex-
ually harassed in at Northeastern Universi-
ty economics building, Stelck said.

44 cases alleging campus sex discrimina-
tion have been closed, limited or Suspend-
ed because of Grove City, Stelck said.
“Enforcement was very difﬁcult before
Grove City. We have gone from a critical
situation to a crisis," she asserted.

"1 don't think things have actually got-
ten worse" for funding women's sports,
said Jane Troxell of Women's Center at
the University of Maryland, where charges
of Title IX violations have flown. But
Troxell agrees “women have lost clout” in
dealing with discrimination because of the
Grove City decision.

The Dept. of Education’s Office of Civil
Rights (OCR), which since 1972 has spon-
sored most of the legal challenges to on-
campus discrimination, now must find out
if the program a student complains about
directly gets any federal funds.
