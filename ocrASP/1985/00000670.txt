COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE -—
There will be about 575,000 fewer
students enrolled in college by
1993. the National Center for
Education Statistics predicted last

week.

In its most recent long-range
enrollment forecast, the NCES
projected enrollment nationwide

would fall

from the current

estimated 12.25 million students
to 11.676 million students nation-
wide over the next eight years.

While the decline would leave a
number of colleges — especially
smaller four-year private colleges
— gasping for students and sur-
vival, it is a much less severe
enrollment drop than the NCES
has predicted in the past.

Starting in the mid-seventies.
the NCES and other agencies
predicted precipitous enrollment
plunges for 1980, 1981. 1983 and
then 1988.

Experts foresaw as many as 200
colleges closing up during the
eighties.

The doomsday predictions
stemmed from a marked decline
of in the number of IS-year-olds
in the U.S. from 1979 to 1992.

Colleges. of course, had always
recruited most of their new
students from that age category.
“From that. people deduced that
higher education would lose
enrollment. provided the same
demographic mix as we had in the
early sixties," said Elain el-
Khawas. research director at the
American Council of Education.

Administrators have avoided
the big drop by recruiting huge
numbers of “non-traditional
students." people older than 24
who may attend school part time.

“It‘s such a wide age group
(non-traditional students). It’s
hard to work out a meaningful
relationship between an age group
that large and college attendnce."
asserted Vance Grant. the
NCES‘s chief statistician.

In 1980. the center projected
total college enrollment would
fall to little more than 11 million
students by 1988. _

The center now estimates that

\r.  mus-1' W

as of the current semester, enroll-
ment declined by less than
250.000 from the all-time high of
12.5 million in 1983.

The NCES wasn't the only
agency to predict more
precipitous delines. Ofﬁcials at
the universities of New Mexico,
Georgia and Kansas. among
many others. predicted enroll-
ment drops as recently as three to
four years ago, and are now sur-
prised by student body increases.

“It was so well anticipated that
we worked doubly hard to avoid
it," said Claire Swann. admis-
sions director at Georgia. where
the “baby bust" age group of in-
coming freshmen has grown by 19
percent.

“We also expected a drastic
drop in enrollment. Gail Latouf
of the American Association of
State Colleges and Universities
says most associations have been
somewhat surprised by not get-
ting the dip we expected.”

Older students have made the
difference. said Bob Aaron with
the National Association of State

Higher Ed.

his family was poor."

The law established a host of
federal programs most students
and administrators take for
granted today: aid to black col-
leges and college libraries. funds
to expand academic facilities and
financing for laboratory and
television equipment.

But the student financial aid
provisions of the bill had the most
impact.

Until then.

“People are going back for ex-
tremely pragmatic reasons: career
oriented decisions.“ Aaron
observed. "Many people in high
tech are coming back for
retraining."

He adds the increasing attrac-
tiveness of changing careers in
later life and the ever-rising par-
ticipation of women in the
workforce also have prompted
more “older” people to enroll.

However, college ad-
ministrators shouldn’t jump for
joy just yet.

While there are now about 15
percent more “older” students in
college than in 1979. the
22-to-34-year-olds are also a
much bigger percentage of the
total population than they used to
be. Michael O'Keefe writes in a
recent Change magazine article.

As a result, colleges really have
tempted only 2.6 percent more of
the “nontraditional” student age
group to register. a less-than-

students could get private scholar-
ships. while the government pro-
vided GI Bill benefits for veterans
and a minor loan program for
students from poor homes.
The Higher Education Act
changed all that.
By today's standards, the law's
provisons were puny. Some
140.000 students from poor
families were to get “scholar-
ships" of between $200 and
$1000.

spectacular increase, . O'Keefe
said. I

_ But demographers say a new
group of students — children
born in the mid-seventies to the
early eighties to the World War [I
baby boom generation — will
start enrolling incomes: in a few
years.

Some administrators don’t
believe projections indicating an
enrollment decline anymore.

While the NCES's latest
forecast predicts junior and com-
munity colleges will lose 200.000
students by 1993. for example.
Jim Mahoney of the American
Association of Community and
Junior Colleges won’t listen.

“We did not participate in the
doomsday conversation because
of the age of our students.”
Mahoney said.

The average community college
student is 29 years old, he noted.

Enrollment at community col-
leges is about 4.7 million, and
Mahoney expects it to be stable
into the nineties. when there
might be a slight increase. Cl

There is little doubt the finan~
cial aid helped fuel the surge in
higher education enrollment that
is tapering off only now.

Critics say there . have been
negative effects of the bill, too

They argue the law made it too
easy to go to college. that it’s
allowed colleges to raise their tui-
tions faster than the inflation
rate, and that it's lowered the
quality ofcollege eduations. E1

“The reason we're worried about that
more (than national: rankings) is because
that’s our goal," stressed Ford. “If we get
a playoff spot. then we’ll focus on the na-
tional scene.” ’ ' . ‘ x

and was sacked on third down.‘ On fourth'
down, Milano was on the sidelines. Ford
inserted Jeff Russell. the man who led the
Danes‘ wishbone in 1984.

“Jeff has a bigger hand and he could
thi'ow the ball a little deeper.” explained
Ford. “And Jeff’s hands were dryer."

The logic proved futile as Russell’s
desperation pass into triple coverage nick-
ed off Donnelly's hands, falling to the wet
surface incomplete.

The Albany players found it difficult to
accept losing to a team they felt superior

"to. “They were not a good team,’f said

defensive end Rick Punzone. “They
'weren’t sound offensively. Take away
those thregplays. we not only shut them
out. but we shut them down."

Cortland coach Larry Czarnecki felt the
better team won. “We did what we had to
do. Those breakaway running plays
weren’t by accident. They were playing
their linebackers deep. They were begging
us to run the ball."

Ford took part of the blame for the
Danes’ second loss of the season. “Maybe
I didn't have them as prepared as they

Hopefully the other two openings will
include Albany, provided they win the rest
of their games and a few teams presently
with one loss get knocked off.

called that pass (the second interception by
Viscardi) along the sidelines in the fourth
quarter." . . «
“We were a 4-1 playoff contender
before the game," Ford continued. “We
could go 4-6 with the schedule we have
coming up. This week is going to be a test
of character for us."

counted for a mere 99 yards. . . The

inspiring. They've performed well against
all their SUNY rivals, and have also played
impressively against other high ranked
teams.

Whether or not the Danes can take the
upcoming state finals depends on their
ability to get strong performances from
four or five singles players on the same
day. Two or three stroung matches by
Dane players just isn’t enough against the
tough teams Albany faces. El

will lose. it’s very conceivable that a lot of
teams will have two losses."

Because the Danes obviously can't dic-
tate any of these outcomes. the task at
hand now is to shrug off the nightmare at
Cortland and take their schedule one game
at a time.‘ That means preparing for a

tough Norwich squad that travels to

Universiiy Field on Saturday.
“The loss to Cortland was a damaging
loss,” revealed Ford. “but if the players

have mental toughness. they’ll come back.
We have a great rivalry with Norwich,
and, because they're a military academy.
they’re in great physical shape, so we’ve
got a lot of respect for them."-

Now with two losses._ the Danes need
another four-game winning streak, but
they must also keep an eye on Coach
Ford's scenario.

“It's sort ofa dream. but we have to live
it." E]
