Great Dane harriers end up Short in SUNYACs

By Davld Blette
STAFF WRITER

Facing the first real challenge of the
season, the Albany State men's cross coun-
try team came up empty handed at the
SUNYAC championship meet this past
Saturday at Brockport State. Looking to
defend their SUNYAC championship title
from last fall, Albany took fourth in a
twelve team ﬁeld.

Running away with the title this year
was a strong Cortland State team. Cor—
tland surprised every one by putting four
men in the top ten, to score a solid 39
points.

“Cortland pulled out the best race in
their history," said Albany State Coach
Bob Munsey. .

Taking second in the meet was six-tim
SUNYAC champion (1978—83) Fredonia
State with 49 points. Close behind was a
much-improved SUNY Buffalo team with
50 points. Albany finished with 94 points
to take fourth.

Albany’s poor performance was hard to
e x p l a i n .

“Fredonia, Cortland and Buffalo just
moved out. and we never got going," said
Munsey. Albany did not put a man in the
top ten, and the :47 second finishing
spread for the top five was the slowest this
season.

Placing first in the race was Fredonia
State Ali-American Mike Gaughran, in a
relatively slow time of 27:12 on the fairly

flat 4.9 mile course.

Because the men‘s race' followed the
womens' race, the men faced an extremely
muddy and slippery course, causing many
of the runners to fall. ‘

“it was really, really bad conditions, but
what can you say, it was the same for
everybody," said Munsey.

A few of the Albany runners did have
uniform problems resulting from the
course.

“The mud from the course got all over
our heavy shorts and made them even
heavier. This forced a few guys to pull up
their shorts during most of the race." said
co-captain lan Clements.

The ﬁrst finisher for Albany was senior
Kevin Sheehan. who took 12th in 27:39.
Following him were co-captain Craig
Parlato, 18th in 28:06, Jack Glaser, 19th in
28:07, Chuck Bronner, 22nd in 28:18, Tim
Hoff. 23rd in 28:24. Clements, Slst in
28:45, Trevor Hash, 34th in 28:51. Paul
Dietz, 55th in 29:36, Vernon Miller, 59th
in 29:48, and Pat Paul, 72nd in 30:22.

The big question now is whether the bar-
riers can bounce back. The Danes have
two more meets to get back into form
before the National Qualifiers on
November 15th.

This Saturday, Albany will get another
shot at Cortland during the annual Albany
invitational. E]

it took most of the season, but
the game the Albany men's soccer
team has been waiting for came
Saturday, against Vassar.

“This is how we're supposed to
play," said co-eaptain Tihan
Presbie, of the Danes‘ 2-0 victory
over Vassar, ranked eighth in the
state. and with a 10-1 record go-
ing into the game. “This was our
best game so far."

“We played as a team," said
co-captain Carl loos. “We were
solid defensively, and stronger of-
fensively than in the past."

The offensive surge could be
directly linked. to Presbie‘s return
after a one-game suspension that
required him to miss last Wednes-
day’s game against Oneonta.
Presbie scored the first Dane goal
on a penalty kick at 9:25 of the
ﬁrst half. .

Presbie also had a hand in the
second Dane goal, which was
scored by junior midﬁelder Luis
Franco-Alfonso at 27:11 of the
first half. loos started the play
with a pass down the right side of
the ﬁeld to Presbie, who attracted
the Vassar defense. Presbie then
passed the ball to Franco-

“This is the kind of game we

hope to play for the rest of the'

season and next season also,"
said Presbie. “We were very
strong on defense, and when we
had the ball, we were strong
offensively."

loos, however, still feels there
is room for further improvement.

‘We were stronger offensively
than in the past, but we still miss-
ed a lot of scoring oppor-
tunities," said loos. “Vassar was
good, but not as much of a
challenge as we'd thought they’d
be. We should have won by
more.”

The Danes improved their of-
fensive aggressiveness by taking
16 shots on the Vassar goal. two
more than their opponent and 15
more than they had against
Oneonta. Dane goalie Marc
Cohen had another solid game,
recording 10 saves.

The Danes' next opponent will
be RPI today at 3200. Last
season’s meeting resulted in a tie.

“We're going to beat them this
year,” said Presbie. “We should
finish with a .500 season."

“We'll finish respectably,
though maybe not as we should
have,” said loos. “Our record

13y clinching the SUNYAC East cum. ‘

pionship this weekend the Albany State
"women's volleyball team rese‘rved a spot
for itself in the SUNYAC Championship
to be held Nov. 2. . v‘

After two ‘mini‘ division tournaments,
the ﬁrst of which was played earlier this
season, the Danes are 6-0 in the SUNYAC
East. Their overall record is an impressive
23-3, with two losses to Cortland and one
to Colgate. ‘

in tournament action this weekend,
Albany certainly didn't play the role of the
gracious host as they made victims of all
three of their guests only faltering in a
single game. The Danes defeated Potsdam
15-6, 15-7. Plattsburgh posed a slight pro-
blem for the Albany spikers, but weren’t
too much for the Danes to handle. coming
away with the victory 15-5, 14-16, 15-3. in
the New Paltz match the Danes trounced
their opponent 15-2, 15-8.

“We had more time to play together and
work as a team since the ﬁrst SUNYAC
East tournament, " said team member Pat-
ty Munhall. “We looked like we really had
it together. People who were watching told
me that they noticed that we backed each
other up and covered for each other much
better."

Potsdam, 3-3 in SUNYAC East play,
came in second place and also won an

automatic bid to the SUNYACs. Platt-
still see SUNYAC action if they receive
one of the two at-large bids.

Early last week the Danes faced Colgate
and Cortland back to hack, dropping both
matches. On Thursday Oneonta held on
for five games before Albany ﬁnally ended
it, winning 15-9, 13-15, 12-15. 15—4, 15-13.

‘ ‘It was our roughest
week of the

season....Now we’re
over the hump. ”
-— Pat Dwyer

 

“We barely beat Oneonta." said Albany
Head Coach Pat Dwyer. “It was our
roughest week of the season, with the
number of matches we played, the.
toughness of them, and simply timing with
midterms for the players. Now we’re over
the hump."

lf last week was the roughest week of the
season, then this week is going to run a
close second.

This evening the Danes travel to
Schenectady where they will face Union
and Russell Sage. The toughest part of the

sburgh, 2-4 in the Eastern Division, may'

week will be on Saturday at the Ithaca
tournament.

Bright and early at 9 a.m. Albany starts
off the tournament against their favorite
team, Cortland. Having lost to the Red
Dragons in both meetings so far this
season, the Danes have yet to muster a
winning strategy.

“it should be a rather tough day; we are
playing them all back to back," said
Dwyer. “We’ve lost to Cortland twice so
far. Hopefully, we’ll change that."

He continued, “We're making a few
changes in our serve-recieve patterns. Our
passing has been the problem with
Cortland.”

After Cortland Albany plays Ithaca.
then St. Bonaventure, a Division 1 school.
After sitting out the next round the Danes
will face Nazareth. Except for St.
Bonaventure. every opponent is nationally
ranked.

“This weekend will be a big factor,“
said Dwyer. “Hopefully we‘ll overcome
any hurdles. We play Cortland at least
four or ﬁve times yet this season."

“We'll do really well at lthaca,"said
Chris Hofer. “We’re more together as a
team now and stand a good chance at do-
ing well. We know what we did wrong-
against Cortland. 1 think we‘ve got it down
now. We beat ourselves against them the
other times. Cortland really didn’t do
much except serve well." D

PettichOrd inducted into SUNYAC Hall of Fame,

Running through pools of water. muddy
trails, over logs and down a dangerous
landslideI the women's SUNYAC cross
country championship race at Brockport
last Saturday distinctly resembled a Euro-
pean cross country race.

The Albany runners. making their debut
as mud wrestlers. placed fourth. behind
Cortland State , who won the meet. Eight
points separated Albany from a second
place spot in the meet. Plattsburgh and
Geneseo took second and third places.
respectively.

“it was just wet and wild." said senior
Chris Ver‘ley after finishing the 3.3 mile
course. ‘ r

 

Placing ﬁfth overall and ﬁrst for Albany
was sophomore Kim Pettichord. Pet-
tichord earned a spot in the SUNYAC Hall
of Fame for her courageous run.

Co-captain Karen DeFeo qualiﬁed for
the Hall of Fame for the third consecutive
year, placing eighth.

Senior Lynn Jacobs was next for
Albany, placing 13th. She was followed by
Jackie Phipps and Brenda Watson. who
according to head coach Ron White “ap-
peared out of the woodwork." Running
the last mile together. the freshman-junior
duo placed fourth and ﬁfth for Albany,
respectively.

Junior Kitty Sullivan was next, placing
38th. Rounding out the top seven for the
Danes was senior Bette Dzamba placing.

52nd. Dzamba, who fell down a steep hill
close to the second mile said, "My swan-
dive down the hill showed my conﬁdence
in the rest of the race."

Also running in the muddy obstacle
course was Varley, sophomore Roseanne
Smith and Marylou Webster. ‘

Spikes were deﬁnately called for over
the treacherous course.

“i felt more like I was skiing through
the woods than running without my spikes
today," joked Phipps.

Some team members said Rambo in-
spired them. others said it was the cold piz~
za. Maybe it was the pole in the road.
Possibly it was junior Carol Bart making
mud pics on the course, or junior Sue

 

Gulla pushing her nose plug sale.

“Although the team ﬁnished fourth, it
was not a disappointing fourth", said
White. Only eight points separated the se-
cond and fourth place teams.

Kurthy and Jacobs were named “run-
ners of the meet.“ Phipps and Watson
received honorable mention." said White.

“The best part was not getting my spikes
caught in the logs,” said Watson. Smith
thought “playing in the mud, 1 felt like 1
was a little kid again."

Although is twas a fourth place finish
the Danes managed ro keep their pants on
and induct Pettichord into the same
prestigious Hall of Fame that White
qualified for when he ran for Brockport.
