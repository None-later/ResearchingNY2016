Safety Day to get publicity fund

By Angelina Wang
sum warren ‘

At their Wednesday night
meeting. Central Council voted
after much debate to take S305
out of its Emergency Spending
line (ESL) 'to pay for publicity for
November 7th’s Women's Safety
Awreness Day.

“Every year, SA has helped the
President’s Task Force on
Women’s Safety to sponsor their
Women’s Safety Awareness
Day," said Lisa Donohue, Chair
of the President’s Task Force on
Women’s Safetey. This year,
however, the money was never
budgeted by SA.

“1 was working under the
assumption that there was already
a budget line and that we
wouldn'thaveto dip into the ESL.
There was a definite lack of com-
municarion. We may came short
on other programs if we allot this
money,"said Francisco Duane,
Minority Affairs Coordinator for
SA.

Council Member Nathaniel
Charny asked why SA, which has
its own women's safety line. sup-
ports the President’s Task Force.

“University President O’Leary
is saying that Women's Safety is
not that important to him, and
that SA should pay.” he said.

Steve Gawley, SA President,
agreed. saying the “President
would have giyen $3000 for Cor-
etta Scott King to come and
speak.“ He added, “they should
be able to handle $300, and not
take it from a tight SA budget."

“We are given a small budget
for the Task Force of $1500,"
said Donohue, adding that if the
bill didn’t pass, “we would have
to use the money put aside for
another Awareness Day in the
Spring." According to Donohue,
Eric Schwartzwall, ' SA con-
troller.didn’t see a problem with

the bill passing since SA is a part
of the Task Force, and has tradi-
tionallyhelped with funds.

One-third of the money will be
spent on posters, which had
already been sent to the printers
before Council voted on the bill.
“Members on the Task Force
assumed money for advertising
would be taken care of from
SA," said Doug Tuttle, SA
Media Director. “Posters and
adds will go through regardless of
how the bill goes," he said.

Donohue told the council that
the only result of not passing the
bill was “you’d be killing another
(awareness) day."

Gawley, however, said “I or
Eric never made‘a committment
— i think it was a misunderstan-
ding. I’ll leave the decision of this
up to the Council. I don’t believe
the Task Force is trying to pull
something fast.”

Steve Landis, an off-campus
council member, made a point
that “the Emergency Spending
line is not just for groups that
weren't budgeted for, it is an
emergency function. If a group
doesn’t have ways 05 paying for it
—- they shouldn’t spend it. ~‘

Tuttle responded by saying that
“work, and printing being done
now will not have to be spent by
SA if the bill does not pass. This
is an event which will come off
whatever we vote for this or not.
it is not a crime of this Task Force

Kenny,

that the posters were to be made
before the bill passes. Thid deci-
sion was not an example of the
Executive Branch running ram-
pant with the budget. They had
no choice, they had. to spend the
money."

Jeff Rosen, Council member
for Dutch Quad. said in defense
of the Finance Committee, “I was
under the impression that this
money was needed, and would
ber otherwise supported. We
shouldn't worry about who’s run-
ning the show,as long as the show
goes on.

Steve Russo, Internal Affairs
Committee Chair, called' the
situation “an internal SA screw-
up. Put your money where your-
mouth is. If you want awareness,
you should pay for awareness.”

Stephanie Kay, council member
for Dutch Quad agreed, “it was
our mistake — We allocated for-
them in the past. If we don‘t give
it to them now, we‘ll have to go
through the same thing again,"
she'said.

The bill passed by a vote of
20-7-1. Afterwards Council Chair
Bill McCann lectured to Council
and said, “the point here tonight
wasn't over funding money, or
women's issues. The point is that
people come to Central Council
after they’ve spent money, and
assume we’ll give it to them and
then the bill passes.” El

South Africa." He added that
students were “accused of ignor-
ing the oppressed and the starving
of our own nation, but the truth
is that the injustices in South
Africa are injustices of this
nation.”

Student activists “worry more
about the welfare of this nation
than those who fail to see how the
American corporations in South
Africa take away from the
employment opportunities that
should be available to the people
of this nation," said Duarte.

Bojana Jordan, President of
the South African-American
Pcoples' Friendship Association
and a South African exile, added
that “I just want to say how much
we salute this step taken by
NYPIRG."

According to Jordan, as of last
July. the US. invested $14.6
billion in South Africa, “thus in-
directly enabling it to finance
apartheid, and apartheid lives on
the blood, sweat and tears of 26
million oppressed Africans who
are relegated to a status of sub-

humun being by representatives '

of the 4% million whites."

“We make no apologies. These
companies are in South Africa to
do nothing but help genocide of
Africans by the racist South
African government. Signing this
pledge is a logical followup to the
most glorious divestment action
already taken by SUNY,” said
lordan.

The nuclear freeze movement on cam-
pus is inching closer to its goal of rounding
up 5,000 signatures as part of a nation-

wide petition drive to present at President

Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev. ‘

The movement is hoping to get the
signatures of one million freeze supporters
in time for the scheduled summit talks in
Geveva on November 19 and 20.

After just three days of petitioning in
the Campus Center and one sweep of
State Quad. organizers have collected
almost 600 signatures. according to Peace
Project Coordinator Laura Letendre.

The petition, which is being sponsored
by the Upper Hudson Nuclear Weapons
Freeze Campaign, the local branch of the
national Freeze movement, is an urgent
appeal to Reagan and Gorbachev. It calls
for a ban on the testing and stockpiling of-
nuclear arms while the talks proceed, and
subsequent measures towards a permanent
Test Ban Treaty and a comprehensive
Freeze Agreement.

Although she said she is “really pleas-
ed” by the enthusiastic response to the
petition so far, Lentendre admitted having
doubts as to the impact the petition Would
have on the Summit meeting, even if the
goal of one million signatures is achieved.

“it‘s a big propaganda game on both
sides,” she said, referring to the hostile at-
mosphere generated by the exchange of
petty insults and accusations between
Russia and the United States. Reagan has
already indicated that he will shift the
focus of next month’s summit meeting

form arms control negotiations to Russia’s
human rights violations and expansionist
policies.

Despite the somewhat pessimistic

. outlook for the summit meeting, members

of Peace Project stressed the need for
positive action rather than passive
acceptance.

Tom Gaveglia, who has been with Peace
Project for a year and a half, said he feels
that the “ludicrous and crazy" nature of
the arms race is enough to work against it.

“These problems can be solved," he
said, “it’s not going to happen overnight
and each of us has to do our part."

Gaveglia added that right now. “the
world is in big trouble -I- The nuclear arms
race threatens my life and the lives of
everybody I know."

It is the almost universal fear of nuclear
war and the large public support of a
mutual and verifiable freeze that Peace
Project, and the Freeze Campaign in
general, is trying to draw upon in its peti-
tion drive, he said. . ~

A referendum last year at SUNYA
showed that 85 percent of the voters sup-
ported a freeze and it is estimated that
three out of every four Americans would
like to see an end put to the arms race.
Translating this support into constructive
action, freeze organizers say, is the dif-
ficult part.

“It’s hard,” Gaveglia said, referring to
Peace Project's effort to educate people
about the arms race and gain their support
of an arms freeze,“but somebody has to
do it. People in the movement care about
life. Humans are generally good, it’s just

COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE -- Hoping to
revive the fires of campus anti-nuclear
activism, disarmament proponents are
combing colleges this month tosign up
students for an “unprecedented” nine
month march across the country.

Leaders of PROPEACE (People
Reaching Out for Peace) hope to attract
5,000 people — over 2,000 of them col-
lege students —- to march from Los
Angeles to Washington DC. next year,
a 3,235 mile journey beginning in March
and climaxed by a candlelight vigil by
one million protesters in November.

“Members of Congress have made it
very clear that nothing will happen to
dramatically affect the arms race until
there is, literally, a citizen uprising,"ex-
plaines PROPEACE founder David
Mixner, a veteran of Vietnam war pro-
tests and a longtimeorganizer of state
ballot referenda.

PROPEA CE hopes to gather 5, 000
for nine month anti-nuke march

hopes to raise $18 to $20 million, which
would make it the most expensive, pro-
longed protest in memory.
PROPEACE will also have to find
some way to awaken the dormant cam-
pus anti-nuclear movement.
“Organized anti-nuclear forces on
campus are not there now, but there is a
great deal of receptivity ot the issue,"

week national lZS—campus recruiting

months to walking across the country,
Mayer has organized a panel of pro-
fessors to aid students in getting course

up between 33 and 40 percent of the
participants.

Mayer thinks the sheer magnitude of
