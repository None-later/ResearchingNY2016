With the lectum set out of the way in the
comer, Susan Russell addressed a crowd
made up almost entirely'of women in the
Humanities Lounge Wednesday, speaking
on the legal history of pornography in
America. '

Russell, an :IAlbany attorney, recently
graduated from Albany Law and is Presi-
dent of the Albany chapter of the National
Organization of Women (NOW), and cur-
rently teaches a course in pornography at
SUNYA. Her lecture was part of the
Women’s Studies Department Colloquium
Series.

Russell repeatedly stressed the most im-
portant factor in the debate over por-
nography is deﬁning pornography. “If we
don't ﬁnd a way through it (obscure
deﬁnitions), history will repeat itself," she
said. “The pendulum will swing back and
people who are not our friends will come
up with a solution” which may not reflect
either a concern for women or women's
safety. I '

“As an interest arises there will be
strong actions taken by religious
fanatics,” said Russell, adding, “We will
not let it be taken out of our hands again.”

philosophy as a deﬁnition of self-
sufﬁciency," said Gawley, meaning on~
ly those necessities that would exist with
or without the existence of aldormitory
system would be charged to the
dormitories.

“Services that would exist regardless
of the existence of dormitories are cam-
pus police and grounds crew,” he
explained.

approved the concept of self-

The lecture traced legal action taken by
the government, from. colonial
Massachusetts to the present regarding
pornography. Early legislation, according

'to Russell, was concerned with “the manly
virtue of young men” who looked at- por-
nographic pictures. (Citing current. laws

concerning whose hands pornographic

material may fall into she said, “We have
stayed viewer-oriented,” as opposed to
focusing on women who are victimized by
pornography merchants.

Throughout the discussion of historic
legislation, Russell continuously returned
to‘the problem of definition. “What has
emerged so far?" she asked. “The deﬁni-
tion is key. You can talk about por-
nography all day and the person next to
you may have'another deﬁnition."

Russell proposed a possible explanation
for the relative ovscurity of meaning in the
legal deﬁnitions. She said the wording is
such to deter people from creating por-
nography because ‘lyou will not stray into

I the sphere of sexually‘rexplicit material if

you are not clear on what is obscene.”
“I think there is a harm done when there

is a portrayal of: a wdman being sub-

jugated," Russell said, She added, “There

in redeﬁning and retailoring the deﬁni-

hausted every possible avenue for in-
creasing revenue and decreasing costs,"
said Gawley. ,
“The relationship between students
and educational institutions is tradi-
tionally different from the relationship
between tenant and landlord.” said

“What does enjoy mean 1’”
country about violent images." Russell
said ,she fears, however, that only the

violeilt aspects of pornography may be ~

targeted.

Russell brought the issue back to deﬁni-
tion again in terms of subjugation. She
asked, “What does enjoy mean? Does she
have a smile? Does she object? What is an
object? if you take a picture of a person,

. must promote an environment consis-

tentjvith the. educational process."

In" 1977, the Department of budget
(DOB) ' stated" that  future dormitory
construction projects required the sub-
mission of plans for operational self-

, sufﬁciency before construction plans

would be approved. All dormitories
built since 1977 have been self-
sufficient. At present, 1,800 beds are
now operating under self-sufficiency.

the Legislature advocate increases, not
the: educational institutions."

are you making that person an object?"
“It is impossible to visualize what ~a

world without the subjugation of women
would be like,” said Russell, adding, “The V
law is interested in the status quo, you set ~
up a norm, you try to enforce it, if sub-5
jugation is so pervasive you cannot see it.."
you cannot use the law. I think the law has-f.
to deal with what it can see." ‘

Russell said that too often the courts are
bogged down in whether. something has
any redeeming social value, adding that ,
there is not enough research into the con- .
nection between pornography and ~
violence.

Studies had been done which, according
to Russell. show that people are desensitiz- 1
ed by pornography, but other studies show
people could be re-sensitized into '4
understanding that the women involved ’
are people.

The two polarities in the issue. she said.
are the “free-love people" who see the
women as participants and believe the
solution is “the more sex the better,” and ,
the “Puritans” who view women as always ‘
being victimized and that the answer is no
sex whatsoever, she said.

The State Legislature provided SUNY
with a $6.6 million subsidy last year
which made it possible to balance the
residence hall budget without a dorm
rate increase for the 1985-1986 school
year.

How costs will be divided and
whether or not to delegate full respon?
sibility for self-sufﬁciency to each cam-
pus will be voted on at a later date.

“There are trustees who believe that if
we save money-in dorm costs it will
necessarily beneﬁt academics,” said
McAlevey.
