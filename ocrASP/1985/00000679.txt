Springﬁeld 's DeLong can attest
to that. In last year's game,
Anderson had three intercep-
tions, including Vone for a
touchdown. This year he was

more lenient defensively, but '

burned the Chiefs with a 93-yard
kickoff return touchdown.

"Wayne has scarred me per-
manently,” said DeLong. “On
that kickoff, we thought we had
him. We had a boy hit him to
slow him down. Wayne changed
directions and we didn’t have
anyone fast enough to catch him.

away from him, he’s so quick,
you don’t want him chasing down
the play,” said Ford.

Mynter, on the other hand,
displayed a certain military indif-
ference toward Murphy's excep~
tional talents by saying. “We

“As a free safety," said‘Coach
DeLong, “he's an important part
of their defense play after play.
He’s a kid who can make a key in-
terception and not get beat deep.
That's where his talents lie."

This year the interceptions
aren't coming in such high
numbers; Anderson got his first
against Cortland last week.
Flanders blames that on his
reputation.

“They're not going to attack
Wayne’s area.” said Flanders.

they’re a little more wary to go to

Anderson doesn’t mind the
fewer interceptions, as long as the
team is doing well.

“If we were 8-2 and 1 had one
interception,” said Anderson,
“or if we were 5-5.(last year’s
record) and I had nine intercep-
tions, I’ll take the one intercep-
tion every time.”

Given this year's team talent.
Anderson might have the best of
both worlds this season. El

last week, with ﬁeld goals of 40,
47 and 3l yards along with an ex~
tra point.

Because another loss will all but
eliminate Albany from post-
season play, they go into Satur-
day’s game with the ultimate in-
centive for winning.

When asked if he had told his
players that they can play the
spoiler role for Albany's playoff
chances, Mynter laughed. “No,
deﬁnitely not. We’ve got our own
v)roblems to worry about.”

Men;bootersrau to RPl, 3-2

By Cathy Errlg
STAFF warren -

There was both good news and
bad news for the Albany State
mens soccer team following Tues-
day’s game against RPI. ,

The good . news was that the
Dane booters'. scored two goals,‘
and of their 13 seasonal games
played thus far, only two of their
opponents have scored more than
that amount against the Danes.

The bad news was that this was
one of those tWo times._

The booter’s defense, usually
the team’s strongest asset, was
not quite up to par, as they allow-
ed the Engineers to score three
times, resulting in a 3-2 Dane loss,
dropping them to 4-7-2:

   
 

“RPl was not as good as some
of our opponents have been,”
said co-captain Carl loos. “We
were .weak in,the mid-field, we
dominated them for 80 yards and
then gave them the last 20.”

RPl's, John Biscette opened
the game‘s scoring with a goal
29:34 into the first half. Less than
two- minutes later, at . 31:0l,
Albany freshman Ed Regan 

' ed the ball "to forward John

Willard, who scored to tie the
game at l-l .,

Willard gave the Danes a 2-1
lead in the game’s second half,
scoring on a penalty kick at 61:40:

The lead was short-lived,
however, as Biscette tied the game
less than 10 minutes later With a

  

 

goal at 70:07. RPl took the lead
with less than six minutes remain-
ing. scoring the game's final goal
at 84:40.

“The game was characterized
by a lack of finish,” said assistant
coach, Afrim Nezaj. “We
definately had our chances to
score. And if we score two goals,
we definately should win, because
no team should score more than
two goals on us. We play good
defense."

“This was our only real disap-
pointment up to this point," said
loos. “It's our first real setback. I
guess you could blame it on
everyone blaming everyone else
for looking past this game to next
week and not being psyched
enough for it.”

The Danes could understan-
dably have been saving their
energy for this weekend’s Univer~
sity VCenter Championships,

and include Albany. Buffalo,
Stony Brook and Binghamton.
Binghamton, the tournament's

.top seeded team, defeated the

fourth seeded Danes earlier in the
season, 2-0. The Danes have not
played Stony.Brook or Buffalo,
ranked second and third
respectively. ‘ .
“We should play Stony Brook

' in the opening round.” said loos,

“and we're definately looking
forward to playing Binghamton."

EDITORIAL AﬁlSTANT

The Albany State women’s soc-z,
cer team knocked themselves out

of contention for a chance 'at the
SUNYAC title by losing to Hart-
wick and Plattsburgh last week.
After the two losses a victory
over Castleton Vermont Monday
revived their hopes of at least vy-
ing for the State Championship as
they improved their record to 7-8.
Fourteen teams in the state
receive bids for the championship

on the basis of an .-index,.

calculated from points awarded
for victories. More points are
awarded for wins over opponents
higher in the standings. ‘

Albany could have picked up
some important points against
Hartwick last Tuesday, but late
second half pressure by Hartwick
produced the only goal of the
game at 37:25, and settled a
scoreless deadlock that appeared
to be heading for overtime. But,
according to Albany Coach Amy
Kidder, her exhausted troops
would not have falred much bet-
ter had the game reached
overtime.

“Exams really caught up with
us; we just ran out of gas.” said
Kidder. “In the second half, I was
thinking, ‘If we don't score,
don't think we can make
overtime'."

Both teams played evenly for
most of the game, but most of
Hartwick's 25 shots on goal came

during_..the. .late ..shooting. hinge,
and even a sparkling l3-save per-
formance  Dane keeper Karen
Campbell couldn’t hold out
forever. ‘ .
Albany's frustrations carried
over into 'the Plattsburgh game
and erupted into a foul-filled bat-
tle that kept the officials busy:
Plattsburgh was tagged for 11

fouls in the second half alone. ’

When the smoke cleared.
however, Albany was on the short
end of a 3~l defeat and in jeopar-

ydy of missing any'kind of post-

season play. .

“It was an absolute war out
there, an absolute war," said Kid-
der. “We have emotional players,
and they just got caught up in
that kind of game. lt was just real
destructive. ’ ’

Although the shots on goal
were even, l2-ll in favor of Platt-
burgh, Albany’s attempts to keep
Plattsburgh scoring threat Darlin
Levielle were futile. as she drove
home the game-winner at 23:37 of
the first half after teammate Beth
Campbell had put the Cardinals
up l-O six minutes earlier.

‘We knew they were having
trouble on re-starts, and that’s
when we scored, on an indirect
kick," said Kidder. “We weren't
finishing our plays, though, and
that's been our nemesis all year.”

When the Danes travelled to
CaStletort with their 6-8 record in
tow, they knew they would be
playing the spectator's role in the

SUNYAC championship... but 31 ,

3-1 victory kept their hopes alive
for a bid in the state tournament.

‘ “we . aren't going to the
(SUNYAC) playoffs." said Kid-
der, “but we have an outside
chance at the states because there
are a lot of teams around .500."

Freshman forward Joan
McNamara's goal 6:43 into the
second half settled the offense
that had seen a first half goal miss
the buzzer by one second.

“It's hard playing against a
team like that because they play
goal-line to goal-line, so we had
to change the point of attack by
kicking deep passes over them in-
stead of keeping the ball on the
ground," explained Kidder.
“When Joan scored, wefinally
started to’ relax."

Amy Lowell assisted on
McNamara’s goal, and Kim
Kosalek and Cheryl Henson did
the same for forward Sue Frost at
25:06 of the second half, as she
converted an indirect kick to put
Albany up, 2-0,

Castleton got a goal back at
35:30, but designated corner kick
specialist Mary Dulkis served up a
header to McNamara three
minutes later that put the game in
the bag.

At 7-8, the Danes now await
this weekend's compilation of vic-
tory points to determine whether
they will be among the 14 state
championship hopefuls. [Tl
