Tire Bachman Books
by Stephen 
Plume Books

692 pages. $9.95.

fStephen King really wants people to
take him seriously, he’ should stop
writing introductions to his novels as
simpering as the one which preceeds “The

Bachman Books: Four Early Novels by \

Stephen King."
John Keenan

The revelation early this summer that
Stephen King had been writing a series of
books under the pseudonym Richard
Bachman gave King’s‘ readers some cause
to wonder why King had; been using a false
name. In an introduction section entitled
"Why I Became Bachman,” King explains
his reasons. for the pseudonym, and quick-
ly goes through what he considers to be
the merits and faults of the four books
presented in the collection. This introduc-
tory section has now become easily
recognizable as the “King Gets Chummy
With His Faithful Readers” section, a
technique he employs in about every third
book. it's long, pointless, and kind of an-
noying. But you do get to hear his story on
how, and why, he became “Richard
Bachman."

 

 

But the flaw of the introduction, and
maybe the reason for the pseudonym
itself, is that King evinces no conﬁdence in
the four novels he’s presenting to us. "Are
they good novels?" he asks. "I don't know.
Are they honest novels“! I think so."

So, what the hell is an "honest novel?" ‘_
The reader buys a book with the expects. I
tion that it’s a good book, not that it’s an

his past Sunday the Albany County

Emergency Task Force, in collabora-

Capital Fun(d) Drive '35, Albany’s “Live

to help stock their pantries which feed
Albany's hungry through the winter. The
event lasted from 1 pm. to midnight and
was divided into variety-style matinee and
evening shows.

honest one. And if King is. trying to explain

‘ that the Richard Bachman pseudonym was
’ - just a wayvof, breaking out, of having a lit-
‘ ,tle fun and stretching a bit without having

to fulfill the obligations of being "Stephen
King," then let him say so, (which he does
later on). For a man with as many fans as
he has, he certainly isn‘t showing much
confidence.

And the most ironic thing about his
whining is that in three out of four cases,
they are good novels. No, he’s not going to
win the Pulitzer with any of these entries,
but he isn’t going to win the Pulitzer for

' anything else. he’s written, either.

The strength of each of these works is
King’s imaginative scenarios. The leadoff

novel, Rage,‘is= about an’ insane student 1

The afternoon show featured perfor-
mances by Doc Scanlon, Lisa Robilotto I
Prodigy, and Begonia. Street dancers,
mimes, magicians, jugglers, and other l0cal
performers also entertained the matinee-
goers. ' _

The evening show boasted entertain-
ment by some of Albany's best club bands
and, despite an often too restricting half
hour time limit, each band was able to give
listeners a good idea of. what they were
musically about.

 Stephen (King finally stands up

for a day. Rage is the kind of horror novel
that somebody might like, but would feel
vaguely ashamed of'liking. When i finish-
ed it, my first reaction was “God, that was
fun." My second was, "God, am i sick."
Rage is one of the better novels here, but it
is somewhat flawed, and a weak ending
doesn’t help much, Nonetheless, it stands
up well against King's "real" books.

Not so Road Work, the second book in

the collection. Honest it may be, but it cer- -

tainly isn’t very good. Reading it was a
chore, and even playing REM loudly as I
tried to work my way through it didn't
make it anymore enjoyable. it is in Road
Work that King’s inexperience (none of

a these books were written later than 1980)
really shines through.

in sharp contrast, The Long Walk is
definitely the best book in the collection. It
stands up exceptionally well to almost
anything King has written, and, with a lit-
tle more work, might have been one of his
best books. Again, the book isn’t ﬂeshed
out completely, but it's as near a miss as the
collection offers.

The story centers around a futuristic
sporting event called the Long Walk, in
which 100 adolescent boys have to walk
until only one boy is left walking (the ones
who stop walking are shot). The novel
weaves interesting characterizations
around each other, and, as the walk con-
tinues, and more and more people stop
walking and die, the novel achieves an in-
tensity that King should be proud of. (But
is it honest, Steve?)

The final novel, 7778 Running Man, is
more interesting for the world it takes
place in than for anything that actually
happens. Set in the not-so-distant future,

' I the only way the lower class can make

money is to audition to appear on game
shows. An example of the kind of futuristic
gam'e show King cooks up is Treadmill For
Bucks, which takes people with heart and

  

The Stompiietios

Dance Planet played the first half of the
show, experiencing equipment difficulties
that particularly disrupted Dance Planet’s
performance. These first three bands were
followed by a seemingly unending Filene's
rock fashion show complete with motor‘
cycles, dancing Doniinatriwiiggcd
models, and clouds of fog. Chefs of the
Future, the Stomplistics, and Who Likes
What rounded up the evening with the
night’s beet performed numbers.

All three of these last bands were in-
strumentally together. Hearing them was
definitely worth paying the admission and
sacrificing a night of study. Hearing Chefs
of the Future’s “Red Soldier" and newer
material alone was worth It. The
Stomplistics’ overall funky, reggae, klnd of
soulful, bluesic, rock ’n’ rolled up sound
was equally entertaining, although the

"The Bachman Books" are good books,
all in all. if Richard Bachman really existed,
he might be considered a challenger to
Stephen King's domination of the horror
market, But the real sad.» thing about the
“death” of Bachman is that Bachman pro~
bably would have stood up for his books,
not whined about them, the way King is
doing. Even under an assumed name,
King’s the best.

vocalist's voice was weak from the strain of
the band‘s previous weekend's concerts.
Who Likes What’s opening cover, "l Am
The Walrus,” was not a particularly good
clue of the band's capabilities (the vocalists
are best with originals), but "Leave Me
Alone" and "Green Onions" revealed the
band‘s talent at full strength.

The event itself provided good enter-
tainment, but, unfortunately only raised
$775, a far cry from the $10,000 that was
hoped for. A publicity error was blamed
for the poor turn out. Whatever the
reason, it's really a shame that so many
people missed out on a good time.
