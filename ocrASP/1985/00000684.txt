The suspicion of stolen exams».de

' cheating plagued the Finance 300 midterm ;
last week and forced department Chair

Hany Shawky to take measures to prevent
such incidents.

In the past, students have been involved
in the the duplicating process of exams,
Shawky said, which may have invited the
stealing and weiiing of tests. “We are com-
ing up with some drastic changes,” he said
explaining, “The changed formats for co-
pying tests will inlcude only the Council
(of) Chairs and no students will be involv-
ed in the processli

The exam, which was planned for
Wednesday October 16, was postponed
until Monday the 21 when there were
rumors that some students had seen the
test beforehand.

He added, “There is so much cheating it is

The problem is important not only
because people who cheat get better grades
but they destroy any curve for students
who studied. said Prafdcr. in reality peo-
ple are being punished for taking the test

in order to attain the status of ‘social

‘nlghts, increasing the menu, and in-
creasing “vlrgin,” (non-alcohol) drinks
are some changes that would. help
“socialize bars." he said. ’ ’ '

Enforcement of a “wristband”
system would be the responsibility of the
bar. Hartman said, suggesting two ways
to control who drinks would be to en-
force a two drink maximum and by
"keeping a strict watch on the number
of glasses given out with each pitcher
sold."

"The main problem is accountabili-
ty," said Hartman, “burs don't want to
be held responsible for drinks getting in-
to the hands of minors." New York

} injunction

While Student Association lawyers won
their first victory against Aibasny’s
Grouper Law Monday city ofﬁcials are
continuing their proceedings against the
landlord most recently found to be
violating the law. ,

According to SA attorney Lew Oliver,
New York State SUprcmc Court Judge Ed-
ward S. Conway has grantd a story which
prevents city ofﬁcials form evicting those
students who are named as plaintiffs in the
SA case against the city.

SA is currently suing the city of Albany
charging that the Grouper law is un-
constitutional. Sixteen students from four
separate households are named as plain-
tiffs in the suit. as well as one landlord.

Monday's eviction proceedings against
two students in two of the houselhods
named as plaintiffs in SA's case were
halted by the city's prosecutors after Con-
wa granted the stay, said SA President
Steve Gawley. Conway wantd a temporary
restraint in order to prevent “those
students from being kicked out," said
Gawley.

‘What we really wanted was a blanket
“to protect all students
violating the Grouper Law from eviction

. until SA’g case is decided by; the Supreme

Courtis‘aid Gawlcy. But, he added, "it’s
difﬁcult to get anything from a judge."

Conway'nlso indicated that he would
consider protecting other student violators
not named in SA's suit on a case-to-case
basis, said Oliver. Conway said he would
“entertain similar applicsatins sym-
pathetically," added Oliver.

SA will seeks preliminary injunction on
November 14 which will prevent city of-
ficials from evicting any student violators,
said ~(hovers. New York Supreme Court
Judge Joseph P. Torraca will decide on
thciujunctio‘i'ij: The decision on the
