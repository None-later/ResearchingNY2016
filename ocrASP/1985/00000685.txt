17 years and agreed to testify against a
former Navy buddy in exchange for a le-

 

that he passed Navy secrets to the Soviet
Union from 1968 through l985.

His son, Michael, pleaded guilty to all
five similar counts that had been brought
against him last May.

Prosecutors and government sources
previously had indicated that Walker, the
alleged mastermind of a family spy ring,
had been paid by the Soviet Union for as
long as 18 years, but the initial five-count
federal indictment against Walker had
covered only evidence for 1985. The new
incident goes back to 1963.

Greelts. taketo the street in attempt .

to improve community relations

By Peter Basile I ..

In an attempt to enhance University-
community relations, members of the Off-
Campus Association(0CA), the Student
Association and campus fraternities joined
together in a street-cleaning effort this past
Thursday.

OCA invited the ﬁfteen fraternities on
campus to join in the cleanup after choos-
ing Hudson Street as 'a starting point
because the area, according to John Har-
rison, chair of OCA, is “a sorespot in the
community. The residents on the block are
‘angry and fed'up. We are doing this for
them." - _

The cleanup is the ﬁr'st'part of theStu-
dent Neighborhood Project: 'SA arid‘OCA
have worked together to initiate other pro-
grams such as the Matchmaker'Projec‘t,
and an organization of student block
captains. _,

Inna-fraternity council participated in
this activity as part of Greek Week. Phil
Botwinik. Community Relations Chair of
Pi Lambda Phi said, “This is-the ﬁrst step
fratemities have taken to affect change in
the University community." \

Botwinik added, “I know my fratemity
will be organizing. extensive projects
throughout the Albany community -—-
ranging from the high schools to the
neighborhood association and any other
way possible.”

The message relayed by all fraternities
present was that Greek Week was only the
beginning of what they hoped would be a
long and lasting relationship between the
Greeks and the local community.

Charles Green. President of Sigma
Alpha Mu said he feels “the community at
large is leery of the fraternities and it is im-
portant to show' them we are not here to
terrorize it, but to be an integral part of
it."

Green said fraternities have much to of-
fer and will prove it if given the chance. He

said he wants to show the community that
their “intentions are honorable, we mean
business, we’re not just running off at the
mouth.”

Steven Noel, Vice-President of Pi Lanb-
da Phi said he would like to get‘rid of the
“animal house stigma” that people have.

was on hand to thank the students for their
efforts. He stressed that the city has an
“obligation to enforce the (Grouper)
law,“ but also emphasized the mayor’s
"willingness to cooperate with the
students." '

Alvaro offered to supply the students
with "trucks for clean-up days...and with
any information you (the students) need.”
He also said that the mayor appreciated
the students’ efforts. '

SA President Steve Gawley said SA and
the city have “come to the point where we
can agree to disagree and still have a work-
ing relationship, but significant differences
remain.” Gawley said “the Greek System
is an asset" and that it is very capable of
helping to initiate positive change in the
community. , El

With a little more than a month
to go before the drinking age goes
to twenty-one, students are
preparing for a change in their
social life and are hoping for a le-

nient alcohol policy on campus. ,.

Recently, the “Implementation
of 21” committee voted

unanimously against making'the ,

university a “dry” campus, and

the ofﬁcial alcohol policy is ex_- -

pected to be “voted 'upon bythe
Universitinouncil on November

It seems that most students
would agree with Maryanne
DiBacco, a sophomore from
Alumni Quad, who said a dry
campus would “be a mistake.
know I wouldn’t like it nll‘b'

drinking wasn't allowed on ’cam'ﬁ'
pus I'm sure that most people,

wuld go elsewhere for alcohol.,"".

 

a lot of people willrjust turn to
drugs because people need
somethingto get- away from the
pressure of classes. Drugs are
already pretty easy .to get and I'm
sure it will get easier when the

. drinking age goes up."

Many students‘said that no

, matter what the University Coun-
; cil decides. they will ﬁnd a way to

drink. Stephen McCloy, a
sophomore .1 from f-Indien Quad,

said "a lot. of .prople. including
myself, are alreadyrusing fake lD
or know someonewho is 2] who
can buy alcohol-for them."

McCloy said that the commit- I

tee's recommendation “Doesn’t

make sense“ because they said it's

okay to have a beer ball in your

_ suitcbut not ahaif-keg, so if you
 want to have'a party. you just put

one: beer ball induce or four
suites.” ‘

Diane Duffy, a junior fromv

“SUN Y shouldnot make a said

policy because the whole 21 year--

old drinking age decision is a kick
in the ass to young people. ”

— Raymond Mariani

' “SUNY should not make a strict

policy because the whole 2l-year-
old drinking age decision is a kick
in the ass to young people. It
show: that older people don't
trust us and are using their power
against us."

A strict alcohol, policy could
also be harmful to the relation-
ship between .students and Resi-
dent Assistants (RA’s), Marielni

said. He said he feels that RA’s

should not have to enforce a pro-
hibitive alcohol policy. “They are
someone students are supposed to
trust and confide in. Making
them into a mini police force will
offend students and make it im-
possible for them to complete the
rest of their duties." _

McCloy disagreed,‘ saying he

feels that “enforcing laws is the

RA’s'job, they're here to make
sure we don‘t do anything illegal

 

DlFacco pointed out that any
restriction of alcohol on campus
“would just cause people to drink
more or do other things." DiBac—
co said she was concerned that a
decrease In alcohol consumption
would lead to an increase in drug
use among students.

Tisha Arroyo. a fresh from
Colonial Quad, sald that “if they
tell us we can't drink on campus.

Dutch Quad agreed. saying that
she is “opposed to banning kegs
on campus. Most students do
their drinking off cmapus. but
when the drinking age goes up,
they won’t be able to, so they lose
both ways. But many people have
fake lD or friends in houses off-
campus anyway.“

Raymond Marlunl, a junior
from State Quad. said that

 

. C  demonstrate Thursday

won't- listen-leammr even respond.”

Wittner said he feels “optimistic” that this
demonstration will draw a good crowd and some
needed public attention, and hopes it will prompt
the state “to begin to bargain more fairly than it
has been." According to Wittner, while there is
“always a possibility of a strike," this is extreme-
ly unlikelybecause of the Taylor Law which.
while guaranteeing government workers the right
to collective bargaining, also imposes penalties as
severe as imprisonment against strikers.

There are major divisions between the
demands of the union and the administration.
According to Taylor. the union is calling for
longevity pay, “a ﬁxture in public schools but
not in SUNY,” an increase in minimum salaries,
“now about Sl4,000.for professors," equitable
treatment for parbtime professors, job protecw
tion, and a “career ladder," which involves pro-
motional advancement for professionals.

The state's representatives not only reject these
proposals. but have made demands of their own
like notificasiton of outside employment and
placing tenure up for renewal every 5 years. Witt-
ner said he speciﬁcally disagreed with the tenure

As a protest of their working without a con-
tract since June 30. members of united Universi-
ty Professions (UUP) will be pieketing and
demonstrating foran hour in front of the Cam~
pus Center Thursday. I  ,

Negotiations between the UUP and the Gover-
nor‘s office of Employee Relations have slowed
since January. When a negotiations impasse was
declared in July, judicial action was necessary to
keep the expired contract in effect, according to
SUNYA English professor Myron Taylor,
secretary of UUP.

On Monday, UUP distributed ﬁyers announc-
ing their demonstration. Similar protests have
been occurring statewide, but this will be
SUNYA's first.

According to SUNYA History professor Larry
Wittner, Vice President for Academies of UUP.
“We feel there is no alternative but to start put-
ting pressure on our state bargaining adver-
saries." The demonstration will consist of an in-
formational picket line and speeches by UUP
leaders. including President Tim Reilly and
member of the Negotiations Committee Chris

According to UUP Negotiations Bulletin No.
9, demonstrations “help us direct our energies at

the source of the problem. the management that freedom."

but I wouldn’t expect my RA to
turn people in. They should take
care of problems on their own."

Many people also said that the
rise of on—campus fraternities is
related to the rise of the drinking
age. DiBacco said that she and
her friends are “thinking of join-
ing a sorority or a little sisters
organization because they could
hook us up with parties-even if we

can't have kegﬁ." r
