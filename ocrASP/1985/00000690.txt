circumstances where the officer

will conduct the search without-

attitudes believed to be biased

(CPS) some graduate assistants at the University of
Miami are protesting having to administer parts of.
the nation's most-quoted annual study of college-

students‘ political attitudes.

The. study. co-rponsored by the American Coun-'
oil on Education and the University of California-
usuaslly covers about 200,000

Los .Angeles.
freshmen arbund the country.

But last week Miami grad assistants. who
surveyed freshmen in English classes. protested the
study — whichin recent years revealed that fewer
students call themselves “liberal” — was biased
and that it could violate students“ privacy.

The grad students asked not to be required to ad- '

minister the suryoy.

The surveys are designed to see what heppens to ~
students’ attitudes when they go to college. Schools
then can evaluate their programs better. according
to ther ACE-UCLA book in which survey results

are published every January.

“It helps the university evaluate itself? That's
hogwash. said Dawn Carleton..one of the Miami in-
structors unhappy with the survey. “How do ﬁrst-
weck freshmen know enough about the programs
here?" she asked. “What does asking students if
they are born-again Christians have to do with a

university evaluating itself?"

Carleton also said she thinks some of the ques-
tions are slanted. One question asks students to
agree or disagree with the statement that “abor-
tions should be legalzcd.” The statement. she
noted. implies abortion is not legal. although it has

bcen since 1973.

“That is not a very well-phrased question in my
point of view.” conceded Austin Frank. director of
student research at Cal-Berkeley. But “if you tinker
with the questions. you may upset the continult y of
the survey.’ he added because researchers are trying
to measure changes in student attitudes throng the

years on a common yardstick.

Both Gloom and Frank said they 'think the
Miami protest was “an isolated incident."

. Englishinstructors simply may have been upset
by the way the survey was administered this year.
added Rod Willis. who is in charge of the the pro-
gram'at Miami. '

Willis asked the English Department to run the
survey this year because more entering freshmen are
enrolled in its classes than any other department.
