Wristbands

stress. though, that W.T.’s is still other
and not a restaurant. .

Byron said the bartender will be
responsible for enforcing the wristband
system and that employees will be sta-
tioned in the back room to look for
abusers. “We made the transition from
18 to 19 observing the law fully and we
will do so again, it is a conscious transi-
tion. We will obey the law and survive."
he added.

Tony Sabatino and Roger Martel. the
owners of the Lamp Post and L.P.s,
said they carefully studied the idea of
employing wristbands but found it
“totally unenforceable.” They added
that although the Lamp Post will be
strictly for the above twenty-one crowd,
the L.P.s dancing club will have one
“dry night" a week featuring a theme or
event to accomodate under 21 patrons.

Sabatino explained, “What is the at-
traction to any tavern where you can’t

drink? Wherewe have the edge is a ‘.

dance club where dancing is the mainiat- I
traction and drinking is not. That is why
we. established L.P.s almost a. year
ago:”. X  "

Sahatino also added a warning to
those who try to evade the “21” law
with fake l.D.s and anyone caught with
a fake i.D. will be arrested on the
premises and the LD. will be _
confiscate ." ‘

The fake LD. problem is much
greater than the few under-aged people
who would be given drinks by those over
twenty one, said Hartman. Major steps
to alleviate this problem were the addi-
tion of ‘ photo licenses. and this year,
SUNYA stopped putting the age of
students on campus l.D. cards. added
Hartman. The reason -for this. said
Hartmen. is that ages are seltlreported
and the University doesn't want to be
held accountable for anyone who is

The manager of the Little Horn, Scott
Russell. said his establishmentywill be
converted to ‘a restaurant after
December 1. Russell estimated that fifty

percent of his clientele are,runder 21, \«
years old. .He said. “The night club

business will be really hurt. it’s not go- »
ing to be the same." A wristband system »

.wouldn't work, retard, because “kids 

usually end up drinking anyway."

The wristband policy is being used in
other areas. said Hartman. in Virginia

\ for hard and softalcoholic drinks, and

those who can purchase hard alcoholic
beverages wear a wristband. Some areas
in New Jersey, also use the wristband
