On"Saturday, October 26, the Albany
State Equestrian team made their inter-
collegiate debut at Skidmore College in
Saratoga taking four first place ribbons.
two second place, and a few more at
fourth, fifth and sixth.

The team competed against riders from
15 other schools, including Cornell,
Syracuse University, Clarkson and six
other SUNY schools. . r

For those new to the sport, 'inter-'
collegiate horse shows are like no 'other
athletic event. The school holding the
show provides the facilities, the horses,
and the saddles and bridles. Every other
team must provide their own/riders ‘and
clothes. ' .  '3" "

Horses are assigned byvdrawing their
names from a hat. Riders are not allowed
on their assigned horse until just before
their class begins. This means everyone has
an equal chance to do well (or poorly). it'
also means there is a great deal of luck in-
volved.

Kris Cannell, president of the team said,
“It’s definitely a combination of skill and
luck —- a majority is luck." .

If this is the case, Albany had a very
lucky day on Saturday. The classes are
divided on the basis of skill and experience
in the following order: Open. In-
termediate, Novice, Advanced Beginner,
and Beginner. .

The ﬁrst classes of the day were over
fences. This means the rider must have the
horse jump a course of approximately
eight jumps or “fences.” '

Because of the number of riders, each
skill level is also broken down into
sections. ‘

Standouts in the intermediate Division
were Doreen Byrne and Mandy Eggleston,
who both won their sections over fences,
and Michelle Ducros, who place second in f

her section.

In the Novice Over Fences Division,
Pam Strauber won her section over fences.

The second half of the day was spent on
“flat” classes, in which the riders take
their horses through paces in front of the
judge.

In the Open Division, Kathy Boyce

“You almost have to laugh, because
teams come in‘ here and See how small we
are, and then after the game, they say,
‘how the hell did we lose to these
guys?’,”said Zaloom. “We went into the
Southern Connecticut game thinking that
winning the game was going to be just
coming out alive.”

But the Dane line was equal to the task
against Southern Connecticut, as they
were against NorWich.

“Against Norwich, we were really com-
ing off the ball, everybody" was,” said
Moriarty, “and that's what Coach Zaloom
has been telling us to do all along, make
sure we come off the ball quick."

So despite their lack of size, Albany‘s

offensive line still presents a formidable

obstacle for opposing defenses, and

Other riders for Albany were Heidi
Hagan, Marcia Rand, Rachel Tabor, and
Andrea Zeeman.

By the end of the day, trainer Lynn
'Vickers of Ballybay Farm, the team's
home base, said,“l was very excited about
the strength of our team, and I'm looking

Zaloom thinks that the proper attitude can
make. up for the.;size disadvantage.
“They’re a super bunch of kids. The
things that make them so good are
courage, a tremendous work ethic, and
they're . fighters,” emphasized Zaloom.

“And I think they're pretty close to each '

other, ’so there’s a unity factor, also."
“We play as one," said Setlow, a New

' Dorp High School graduate from Staten

Island. “We don’t have any one guy who’s
going to blow somebody away, but we play
really well as a unit, and we have quality
back-ups.”

“Every guy on this team is feisty, and
wants to win," added Moriarty.

Nobody is worried about having the
right attitude when the Danes face Hofstra

Early in the fourth quarter, the Danes
went ahead 20-0. Soldini sprung a
33-yarder on that drive and Milano hit
Chris Haynor on a timing pattern at the
side of the endzone with 10:08 remaining.
The Danes’ victory took on greater im-
portance when it was learned that Ithaca,
Hofstra, Kings Point, Hamilton and St.

Eastern playoff bid) lost that afternoon.

forward to our next show."

Reflecting on the day, Mandy Eggleston
said, “It’s tough, because you don't know
what to expect. After all, there are dif-
ferent horses at each show, and you don't
know which one you're going to ride until
just before your class."

The team’s next show will be on
November 9 at St. Lawrence. D

ing to them last year on Long Island.
“It's going to be a war,” said Setlow. “I
didn‘t play against them last year, but I
know a lot of our guys are from Long
Island, so it really hurt to go down there
and get beat."
“We’ll be prepared for them," said

Duffy, a Huntington native who at .nded '

Walt Whitman High School. ‘ ‘i know a lot
of the guys on their team, so I'm going to
be ready for them."

And if Hofstra underestimates the quali-
ty of the offensive line because of their
size, it could be a long day for the Hofstra
defense.

“It doesn’t bother us when they take us
lightly, but it does bother us when they're
actually laughing,” stressed Moriarty.
“That really gets to us. But they're not
laughing in the fourth quarter." D

The Dane players seem obsessed with
making the playoffs, but linebacker Frank
Sarcone gave his teammates a word of ad-
vice. “We know what happened Iast week
in Cortland.” he said. We have to take it
game by game. We can’t look ahead."
