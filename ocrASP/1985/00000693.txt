Seras, William's" 

Wrestler Andy Seras and softball pitcher
Wendy Williams were honored as 1985’s
Sportsman and Sportwoman of the Year

last Saturday.

They were presented separate awards
during halftime of the Albany State-
gamc Saturday

According to Athletic Director Dr. Bill
Moore. Seras and Williams were the only
athletes nominated by the Albany State
coaches. “I think that's a credit to them,”
said Dr. Moore. “You can say it was

unanimous.”

Seras, a four-time All-American, cap-
tured his first NCAA Division III title in
Rock Island, Illinois last March, when he
decisioned top-seeded Matt Bouslog.

Seras’ fame goes “my beyond the con-
ﬁnes of Albany. He is internationally
regarded as a world-class wrestler in
Greco-roman style, which differs from col-

legiate wrestling.

Seras made it to the finals of the Olym-
pic Trials in Michigan, but was edged out
by Minnesota‘s Jim Martinez on a con—
troversial decision that ultimately wound
up in the courts. Seras lost the case, but he
still wound up on the U.S.A. squad in Los

Angelos as an alternate.

“P.P. just did a super. super
job," said Munsey.

Paul's race this Saturday was
the complete opposite of his per-
formance two wer'lends ago at
the SUNYACs, where he was the
last man on the lO-man squad to
finish.

Following Paul in the race for
Albany was Junior Tim Hoff,

who ran a time of 26:38 for 18th
place.

Next to finish for Albany was
Chuck Bronner, who took 22nd
place with a time of 26:47. Bron-
ner has been coming on steadily
this season for Albany.

“Saturday was the smartest
race I’ve run this season." said
Bronner.

Senior Co-Captain Ian
Clements has also been coming on

With Martinezls retirement expected
sometime this year, Joe DeMeo, the Great
Danes’ wrestling coach, has in the past
predicted Seras to be a starter for the 1988
Olympic team in Seoul. Korea. DeMeo is
also the coach of ATWA, a Greco-Roman
wrestling club which has produced many'
Olympians in the past, including gold-
medal winner Jeff Blatnick.

If softball was an Olympic sport,
Williams might very well be the choice for
starting pitcher. Williams threw three no-
hitters for Lee Rhenish's 1985 Albany
State softball team, which went on to cap-
ture the NYSAIAW championship.
Williams pitched in every game, missing
just one inning, as she compiled a 13-5 V
record with a .065 E.R.A. ' '
