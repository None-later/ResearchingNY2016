in the first half of‘Saturday’s game, .

Soldini continued to unimpress, gaining 12

yards on five carries. The rest of the of-.

fense also wallowed in mediocrity, ac-
cumulating only 68 yards by halftime.

Somehow. the Danes were tied with the
Norwich Cadets. 0-0, after two periods.
even though the Vermont school was
severely outplaying the Danes. The skep-
tics were calling Albany‘s playoff chances
doomed.

But in the second half, when the Danes
needed him the most, Soldini was there.
Pounding through holes with his bulldoz-
ing style, Soldini scored the game’s ﬁrst
touchdown on a spirited 13-yard run early
in the third quarter and wound up with a
season-high 146 yards.

What at first appeared to be a tight af-
fair turned into a rout. as the Danes
coasted to a 20-0 victory for their ﬁfth vic-
tory and a firmer standing in the playoff

“Dave means so much to our offense,"
Coach Bob Ford said. “And oar offensive
line was super. They were a big difference
between the performance in the first half
and the second half."

Credit the defense too. as they pitched
their first shut out of the year. in the ﬁrst

r». half. rifle-armed quarterback Mike

Gallagher, aided by healthy pass protec-
tion. was able to move the pass-oriented
Cadets at will until they came within strik-
ing distance of the goal line.

“He (Gallagher) is always going to com-
plete passes." saftey Wayne Anderson
said. “But they have the tendency to hurt
themselves. So we sat back and played it
cool. kind of like the bend but don’t break
theory."

ﬁstuffm‘e mn's " in the J "
backﬁeld, Jerry Brown, a sophomore
from Kingston. saved the Danes from peril
on two occasions. On Norwich’s first
drive, Brown made a touchdownsaving
breakup of a pass intended for Scott

ﬁeld goal attempt. which waswide.

Dane offensive line: Who needs

until the offensive line of the 1983
Super Bowl Champion Washington
Redskins was giamorized and dubbed
the “the Hogs", not much recognition
was given to these faceless players who
sweat it out inthe trenches.

an average weight of 211. the offensive -

if you happened to see the large
crowd down by the varsity
baseball fields this past Saturday.
you might have thought that the

' World Series was relocated to

Albany. but it was just the annual
Albany Cross-Country

' invitational.

The Albany men's cross~
country team stayed on their
home course this weekend where
they faced seventeen teams in
three different races. in the men's
varsity race. the A-team took
third. defeating SUNYAC

men’s junior varsity race. the 13-
team also took third. and in the
non-scoring Alumni Race. eight

former Albany runners returned
to run in the 38-man ﬁeld.

The ﬁrst race of the day was the
Junior College race restricted to
two year schools. Blowing out the
field was a strong team from
Mohawk Valley C.C.

Next came the varsity men’s
race. won by a very strong team
from Division ii Southern Con-
necticut. Taking the first four
places, Southern Conn. came two
points away from a shut-out with
a score of only 17 points.

Taking the second team spot
was Division 1 Siena with a score
of 70 points. Taking third place
with 105 points was Albany.

“The guys really redeemed
themselves. We were the first
Division 111 team to finish." said

Head Coach Robert Munsey.

Albany came back this week
from a disappointing fourth place
ﬁnish last week at the SUNYACs
by defeating SUNY champs Cor-
tland State by 55 points.

“A lot of things hinged on this
race and now they know that they
can run in the big meets.", said
Munsey.

The first man for Albany was
Pat Paul, who took 11th place
with a time of 26:16.

Paul’s time is the fastest of any
Albany runner this year.

“Well. 1' had absolutely
nothing to lose and everything to
gain. so I went for it.” said Paul.

For the third time this season,
Paul was named “Runner of the
