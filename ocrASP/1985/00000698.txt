NUMBER 35

Profs rally over missing contract

By Joseph Fusco

marmammn r

. Members of the United University Professions
(UUP), exercising what one professor called the
“rights or labor," demonstrated in front of the
Campus Center Thursday afternoon to protest
stalled contract negotiations with the Governor’s

Office of Employee Relations (OER).

; The demonstration. which lasted one hour. drew
nearly 100 people, including professors, students,
and university professionals.

The purpose of the picketing, according to
Myron Taylor, secretary of the Albany chapter of
UUP and a SUNYA English professor, was mostly
informational. Taylor stressed the fact that UUP
has worked without a contract since June 30.

Similar demonstrations have occurred on cam-
puses throughout the SUNY system this fall.
although this was the first such protest to take place
at SUNYA. - -

“This basically shows the state and the ad-
ministration that the members of UUP are behind
the union 100 percent and that we are willing to
take action within the rights of labor to bring about
a resolution to, the contract dispute," said John
Reilly, president of the Albany chapter of UUP.
Reilly placed blame for the impasse on the Office of
Employee Relations, who he accused of
', “intransigence.”

‘- One area of contention
' flexibility.

“The issue of ﬂexibility might be an underlying
UPS motive.” said Reilly. “Giving up some control of
management decisions beforelthey have to might
make them nervous. [Our contract pi’QPf’Mlsrequire

that fewer and fewer decisions be made by ﬁat.”

The state legislature passed a bill earlier this year
giving SUNY- greater control over its own manage-
ment. Some of UUP's demands include greater pro-
tection from administrative retrenchment,
equitable treatment for part-time instructors and
scrapping of OER’s proposal for a reviewabie
tenure system, which would subject tenured pro-
fessors to periodic performance review.

Christine Bose, a SUNYA Sociology professor
and a member of UUP’s Negotiating Committee,
stressed that the demonstration was a good exercise
in emphasizing the union’s solidarity. “We’re
behind our union.” she said. “We wanted to
educate our own members and we wanted everyone
on campus to know the issues as well.”

Bose said that during the course of negotiations.
which began last January, UUP proposals have not
been taken seriously and UUP has had difficulty
taking the state‘s counterproposals seriously as
well. “We have a strong astute negotiations team.”
Bose said. “The state can’t puilvthe wool over our
eyes.”

Ron Tarwater, spokesperson for OER, claimed
that the blame lies with UUP, who declared
negotiations were at an impasse on June 25. “There
has been a clear effort and atmosphere on the part
of the state. We are ready and willing to go back to
the table at any time, and have declared so public-
ly," Tarwater said, addng that he is legally pro—
hibited from discussing the particular reasons why
negotiations are at a standstill.

A ﬁre on the ﬁrst floor of lndian Quad’s
Seneca Hall Wednesday morning left
students standing outside for over an hour
as ﬁreﬁghters extinguished the blaze.

There were no reported injuries and
damages seemed limited to the suite where
the ﬁre erupted, but the causes of the 8
arm. ﬁre were a subject for debate.

The ﬁre alarm was pulled at 8:16 am.
by Seneca resident Louis Hyman, who
lives in Suite 102, where the ﬁre started. “i
saw smoke down at the side of my bed and
i got up. I woke up my roommate and my
suitemates. pulled the ﬁre alarm and then
ran outside." he said.

Hyman said that he believed that the fire
may have started from an electrical outlet
somewhere. “i think i lost at least $1,000
of stuff in my room. including a television,
a radio and a couple of jackets,” he said.

After Hyman pulled the alarm. Seneca
Resident Assistants (RAs) lngrid Hansen
and Steven Zirkei started knocking on peo-
ple's doors to get them out. No injuries
were reported.

According to Assistant Vice President
for Facilities Dennis Stevens. the ofﬁcial
report from the fire department said that
the investigation conclusively determined
the fire not to be related to electrical pro-
blems, but that it was probably caused by

however there was smoke damage to the
other bedroom," in the suite.

Many students thought the alarm was a
practical joke. “i didn’t believe that the
fire was real," said Andrew Moss, is third
ﬂoor Seneca resident.

Nancy Louis. administrative aid for the
Public Safety Department said the first of-
ﬁcers arrived at 8:22 am. although there
was some disagreement as to how long it
took the fireﬁghters to arrive.

“it seemed to take quite a while for the
fire department to get here,” said Seneca
resident Chris Hlavatovic. .

David Nirenberg, another resident said
that “until they got the hose hooked up to
the water hydrant it took at least another
10 or 15 minutes.”

However, battalion chief Robert Schaf~
fer said that he had no idea why students
were saying it took so long for the depart-
ment to get there. “We got the call at 8:24
am. and we were here at 8:29 a.m.," he
said.

Students from Adirondack and Cayuga
Halls were evacuated as well as students
from .Seneca and Tuscarora.

According to Elizabeth Marcoiini, Area
Coordinator for lndian Quad, the only
reason why students were evacuated from
Adirondack and Cayuga was because the
ﬁre alarm had gone on at the same time as

  

the one in Seneca. “We don’t know if
there was a connection,” she said, adding
that it was probably a coincidence.

At the time of the ﬁre, students were
also being evacuated from the cafeteria. “i
went downstairs o the cafeteria afterwards
to have breakfast and they kicked me out
of there, too," said Hlavatovic.

The fireﬁghters made their way into the
room and although students say that one
of the windows was open. the ﬁreﬁghters
broke the glass on all the windows. Ex-
plained Stevens, “Firemen do this to
relieve some of the smoke condition in the
room." Stevens said that the northwest
corner of the room was charred and that
before the room can be lived in again it
must be “extensively cleaned." He added
that there was “more smoke and water

damage than actual ﬁre damage."

concert boards

While an impressive list of big name
bands have played the Capital District
so far this fall. few seem to have been
pulled in by SUNYA’s University Con-
cert Board (UCB).

The trend has been noticed by the stu-
dent concert groups at both the Univer-
sity and Rensselear Polytechnic Institute
(RH). and has been attributed to the
opening of the rock club J.B.‘s Theatre.

“1 can definitely say that we have lost
shows to J.B.’s Theatre," said Mark
Seligson. chair of UCB.

“Anything that has commercial suc-
cess will go to J.B.’s." said Seligson, ad-
ding that UCB “is pulling in any shows
they can get."

“It’s a stop for any big band.” said
Seligson, noting that J.i}.’s puts on at
least four shows per week.

General manager of J.B.'s Theatre
Michael Dcnsmore said that .i.l3.‘s tries
“to present a multi~faceted array of
entertainment," adding that “we run on
a varied booking format," which in-
cludes anything front Maynard
Ferguson to X.
