The World  
Dutch refuse invite

The Hague
(AP) Premier Ruud Lubbers said today he
had rejected an invitation by Moscow to
discuss the projected deployment of cruise
missiles in the Netherlands.

Lubbers said the Soviet invitation was
made on condition the Dutch government
put off a final decision on deployment.
That decision was expected Friday.

Lubbers told Parliament he received a
cable signed by Soviet Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov, inviting him for talks
"anywhere" on cruise deployment if Lub-
bers' center-right government postponed a
deployment decision.

“It would not be right to postpone the
decision once more, and so it would not be
right to accept the invitation,” Lubbers
said.

Friday‘s decision, expected to be in
favor of deploying the 48 NATO medium-
range missiles in 1988, would end nearly
years of wafi'ling over the issue.

PLO policy toughened

Rome
(AP) The five parties that form ltaly’s
government pledged a tougher policy
toward the PLO as part of a deal to rebuild
Socialist Premier Bettino Craxi's coalition
that collapsed because of the Achille
Lauro hijacking.

The policy change helped party leaders
to end Wednesday the government crisis
that occurred when one party. the
Republicans led by Defense Minister
Giovanni Spadolini, walked out to protest
the release of PLO official Mohammed
‘Abul cl Abbas.

American officials accuse Abbas of be-
irtg the mastermind of the hijacking, in
which 69-year-old Leon Klinghoffer of
New York was killed.

The settlement among the five parties,
based on a compromise policy declaration.
renews the government's pledge to fight in-
ternational terrorism. it also defined
ltaly's foreign policy objectives and stress-
ed the need for closer consultations on ma-
jor decisions.

 

Juan causes floods

New Orleans
(AP) With damage already estimated at $1
billion, Tropical Storm Juan poured more
rain along the Gulf Coast Thursday as
levees in suburbs of New Orleans and
smaller South Louisiana communities were
strained by ﬂoods caused by the lingering
storm.

PRE VIE W OF EVENTS

The toll from the storm’s four-day ram-
page back and forth along the coast
already stood at seven confirmed deaths.
The storm, downgraded from a hurricane
to a tropical storm Tuesday, also left eight
people missing and thousands homeless.

Gov. Edwin W. Edwards of Louisiana
said 50,000 flooded homes, about $110
million in damage to sugar cane and other
unspecified damage added up to about $1
billion in storm damage.

A dollar estimate of offshore damage
was not available. but several
multimillion-dollar oil rigs were lost or
seriously damaged.

Economy barely rose

Washington
(AP) The government‘s main gauge of
future economic activity rose a barely
perceptible 0.1 percent in September, the
government reported Thursday.
The weak performance of the Index of
Leading Indicators, along with a big in-
crease in the nation's trade deficit, were

 

certain to fuel pessimism about the
economic future.

The slight 0.1 percent rise in the leading
index was sharply lower than the revised
0.9 percent August gain and 0.7 percent
July increase.

Bomb explodes in jet

Grapevine, Texas
(AP) An explosive device blew up inside a
baggage compartment of a jet after it land-
ed Thursday at the Dallas-Fort Worth ln-
ternational Airport. There were no in-
juries, officials said.

The 147 passengers and seven crew
members aboard American Airlines ﬂight
203, ﬂying from Austin to San Francisco,
were quickly removed from the 727 about
8 am. after smoke was found inside a bag-
gage compartment, said John Raymond, a
spokesman for the airline.

The device was in a cosmetic case inside
a baggage holder used to transport luggage
to and from the plane, said Joe Dealey, an
airport spokesman.

Revamped elect-ions poiicyinciudes financing

By Angelina Wang
STAFF WRITER

When Central Council ad-
journed from its weekly meeting
at 1:45 a.m. this past Thursday
morning, much of the Student
Associaion Elections Policy had
been drastically rewritten.

Candidate’s for Student
Association's top offices can now
receive SA money to help defray .
the costs of campaigning, while
the space allowed for pestering
was severely limited by the new 
regulations, which were passed.
15-6-1. '

Specifically, SA presidential or
vice presidential candidates that
receive 15 percent or more of the
regular election vote can be reim-
bursed a maximum of $150 for
election expenses provided he or
she can, show receipts to prove
these expenses.

Leading the debate against
campaign financing was Student

past, the commission “usually
has just been workers, but not
(some)one educated enough to
adjucate policy" according to
Russo.

The Election Regulation Act
establishes one Election Commis-
sioner, eight area coordinators,
one for each quad and three for
off campus, and a “special
assistant."

The responsibility of the Elec-
tion Commissioner is to enforce
elction policy. “A quad coor-
dinator runs the election on that
quad." said Russo. The special
assistant will help deal with com-
plaints or “fill in in case one quad
coordinator gets sick," said
Russo;

“This way we're guaranteed
two people at every polling place <
an area coordinator and a poll
watcher." said Charney. Russo
agreed saying the act “establishes

Action Committee Chair Larry
Hartman, who said, “Campaign
ﬁnancing doesn’t belong in elec-
tion policy." SA Vice President
Ross Abelow agreed saying, “it
would be ridiculous for students
to support students who want to
run for ofﬁce." Abelow said he
believed it would be setting a
dangerous precedent, and‘added,
“We’re forcing students to sup-
port individual campaigns."

Steve Russo. lntemal Affairs
Committee Chair said. “We feel
elections should be accessible to
all those who have the ability" to
get involved. “This is integral to'
everything we are trying to do
with this policy —— open (elec-
tions) up to all of these people.”

said Russo. v

“It will 'open up SA, and as a
result, a viable candidate will now
have a financial foundation from
which to build,” added Nathaniel
Charney, Internal Affairs Vice
Chair.

Hartman replied, “It’s not
because 1 want uninvolved peo-
ple. but you’ll give them the false
hope that they can win (an elec-
tion) with $150 , then not end up
getting 15 percent of the vote."

Betty Ginsburg, SA student where before there was no

programming director agreed
with Hartman and said she believ-
ed there should either be "equali-
ty or subsidize everyone."

When asked when the money
would be given, Russo said, “It
wouldn’t be until after the
election.”

Ballroom to become political arena this Sunday

By Olivia Abel

The Campus Center Ballroom will be
transformed Sunday into a political arena
as candidates campaigning for local elec-
tions focus their attentions on SUNYA
students.

Student Association's Student Action
Committee is sponsoring the third annual
“Meet the Candidates Night" Sunday,
November 3, at 7:30 pm.

According to Student Action chair
Larry Hartman the format will be relative-
ly informal. Each candidate will have a
couple of minutes to discuss what they feel
is pertinent to the students. “This is a uni~
que type of situation; There will be
Democrats and Republicans and students
will be able to talk to them and have them
answer your questions personally," said
Hartman.

Bookstore pledges anti-shoplifting

By Pam Conway
EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

Prospective shoplifters should think
twice about stealing merchandise from
Barnes and Noble bookstore, now that a
stricter prosecuting policy has been
implemented.

On October 30th, Barnes and Noble
adopted a policy which states that charges
will be ﬁled with university police against
any person caught stealing. no matter what
the amount.

Bookstore manager Patrick Haze said
that although shoplifting is not a major
concern, “it is a problem everywhere
which all retail outlets must deal with."
Haze estimated that the bookstore loses
about $160,000 a year to what he called
"shrinkage", a large portion of which is
the result of student shoplifting, while the
rest is attributed to employee theft and
paper error.

To control customer theft. Barnes and
Noble uses a security system made by 3M
which involves magnetically “bugging”
items which are then desensitized at the
time ot‘ purchase. Items which have not
been desensitized will trigger an alarm

Candidates slated to appear ‘Sunday,",. I
' ‘ y es yaware of local politics. “We are

night include “Albany Mayor - Thomas
Whalen who" is‘ up for rte-election, Joseph
Lynn, Bob Van Anburgh, Nancy Burton,
Torn Burch. Harold Greenstein, Richard
Bennett and Nick Collucio all running for
City Alderman positions, and Helen
DesFosses, running for Albany School
Board.

Referring to issues that the candidates
will be discussing. Hartman said he feels
that “ways to improve student-community
relations will be a focal point." Can-
didates may aim discuss issues like the
“Grouper Law,” off campus housing, and
parking issues.

Stephanie Kay, Vice Chair of Student
Action stressed the importance of student
voting. She said that students spend nine
out of twelve months in Albany and that

thosey‘stu‘dents living off campus should be

a‘ part of the community. Students often

get taken advantage of because they are

passive. But if we prove them wrong then
they’ll have to acknowledge us," she said.

“We feel that if students do voice their
opinions then we can have a meaningful
say in the community,” she added.

“For an issue that a student feels strong-
ly about they can‘t expect anybody to
listen if they don’t vote,” Hartman said.

Kay acknowledged that a lot of students
don’t have the time to keep up with local
politics. “Meet the Candidates Night"
could be very informative, she said.

Hartman added that students should try
to attend even if only for the social aspect
of the evening. He said he expects between
200 and 300 people to attend.

 

“The system has been
very effective in cutting
down on shoplifting.”

— Patrick Haze

 

 

when taken out of the store. Although
"not all items are bugged, the system has
been very effective in cutting down on
shoplifting."

1n the past. said Haze, customers caught
shoplifting would be turned over to cam-
pus security “depending on whether or not
they were repeat offenders and the amount
they had stolen." He added that, "it is
usually just easier to embarrass the person
and let thcmn know they won't get away
with it."

This, however, has not been effective
enough. said Haze. “We may stop that

one person from stealing again, but no one
really sees anything. it's just a slap on the
wrist and tends to lead to repeat
offenders."

If a customer is prosecuted. the
bookstore has the option of having the
person arrested on a criminal charge which
would result in a possible court ap-
pearance. or having them appear before
the University Judicial Board.

According to Karlecn Karlson, Assistant
Director of Residential Life. the University
prosecution procedure is the same for
shoplifters as it is for other offenses on

250 people attended last year's “Meet
the Candidates Night,” which was strictly
a question and answer session, said Hart-
man, mentioning that this year's format
will be better suited for students. “if
students have something they would like
addressed, it is a perfect time to ask,” he
said.

According to Hartman, Student Action
has registered 4,200 students to vote this
year, as opposed to 6,000 students
registered last year. Also, last year, interest
was greater because it was a presidential
ballot, he said.

SA President Steve Gawley summed it
up by saying that one of the major pur-
poses of “Meet the Candidates Night" is
that “we are trying to provoke an educated
vote."

campus.

“The student has a choice," said
Karlson, “of three options. Most choose
‘mutual consent' in which the student
pleads guilty and does not have to have a
judicial hearing. because they embarassed
at being caught and just want to take the
punishment. "

The second option. said Karlson, is for a
student to meet with a hearing officer who
will hear both sides and make a decision as
to whether the person is guilty or innocent.
This option. according to Karison. “is
usually chosen when the student is guilty
but just wants to explain his side of the
story."

An accused shoplifter can also opt to
present the case in front of a peer board
made up of between five and ten students
who will decide whether or not the student
is guilty, said Karlson.

The typical penalty for shoplifting, said
Karlson, is "a sanction or University
disciplinary warning lasting for one year.
but that can change depending on the at-
tltude of the student and the alnount of the
crime." E]
