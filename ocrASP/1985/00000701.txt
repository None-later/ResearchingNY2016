Frat ruling handed down

A state court ruled last week' that Sigma Chi of-
ﬁcers from the University of Virginia were not ac-
ting as University agents when they planned a
fraternity outing in 1982 that killed two students
and permanently disabled another.

The outing ended when a truck filled with
students and two kegs of beer overturned. Thomas
Stumm. who suffered irreversible injuries, is now
suing for damages.

In August, a Colorado state court held the
University of Denver liable for a fraternity accident
in which a student was injured.

Blacks underrepresented

In a recent report. the American Council on
Education has found that in 1982. black students
made up 9.9 percent of the enrollment in college
academic programs across the nation. 12 pecent of
the United States’ population is comprised of
blacks. ,

‘ ACCording to the report. American universities
and colleges are suffering from “chronic undern
representation" of blacks in college classrooms. »

 

The report cites this as proof that “the problem
of access for minority students has not been
solved."

Fold‘y‘specia‘lines in mosical communications

By Mark Kobrlnsky
STAFF WRITER

If you lobk at John Foldy, he'
appears to be “just an ordinary
guy.” However,
complishments are many, and his
attitude about life is
ordinary.

F o l d y i s
originally from.
Burnt Hills,
New York. and
has been atten-
d i n g S U N Y .
Albany for the past ten years.
While attending SUNYA as an
undergraduate, Foldy
business and communications,
and as a graduate student received
a master's degree in communica-
tions. Foldy is presently pursuing
a PhD. in Communications and
Sociology. .- "

For the past three years, Foldy

has been researching and for-.

mulating the “Harmonics
Theory" with Donald Cushman
and Joseph Woelfel, two promi-
nent professors in SUNYA's com-
munications department.

According to Foldy, “This
theory fringes on communica-
tions. but it is on the border of
bio-physics and energy systems.”
He further explained that the
theory “focuses on the relation-
ship between thoughts and
events. I’m suggesting for my
dissertation that there
phenomenon in nature called
rhythm entertainment."

Foldy continued, “I’m trying

to address thingsfrom a com-
munications and physics view-
point in. order to develop a
framework that will address the
issues of the nature of xcon-_
sciousness, principles of physical
evolution, responses for actions,
and the existence of para-normal
phenomenons." This theory has
not been proven, however Foldy.
is hopeful and determined.

Foldy won a grant to present
this theory in Hawaii. “After
presenting the theory, one of the
scholars at the conference walked
up to one of our faculty members
and asked ‘ls this guy serious?”
Foldy said he doesn't expect
everyone to agree with the theory.
however, he presented it to almost

“Putting posters'in classrooms
will only result in more. campaign
Cheating,” said Council member
Mike Brocci. He said he believed
it would be hard to determine the
number of posters put up by each
candidate, and impossible to stop
people from ripping them down
at night.

“Can't we give some board
space for academics? I don’t
think this will hurt the candidates
that much,” said Russo.

“If one candidate puts them up
then the others must in order to
compete and there are just too
many classrooms," said
Academic Affairs Chair Mike
Miller.

According to Russo. Internal
Affairs spent a: lot of time and
energy into bringing the Election
Regulation Act before the coun-
cil. “It is LI good policy and it will
run good elections." he said.
Many hours were spent in coming
to an agreement. but Russo con-
cluded that he ,was glad “we

told him a little about‘the har-

and asked to read it. I immediate-

Cuomo’s response to the
theory was “very ﬂattering." The
governor wrote. “I admire the
conclusion of your thesis that
there is an ultimate justice in the
universe. but it may take people
some time to fully appreciate the
elegance of the harmonic
approach.”

Besides researching his theory,
Foldy plays lead guitar and sings
with three‘different bands. The
Rob and John and Ed band plays

mainly acoustic rock. They can be .
seen at the .Lark Tavern, and they .

have participated in Telethon

The band also recorded an
album entitled “Ronald Reag-

Foldy cheerfully added that “a
national distributor has picked it
[the album] up, and the local
critical reviews are very strong. It
was the most exciting thing I’ve' I
ever done." The band is presently
recording another album. 

Foldy is also a member of the
Lost Art band, which plays its
progressive rock music in clubs in
Rensselear. They have recorded
six songs in a recording studio,
and their first review said the
band was a “cross bewteen Frank
Zappa and Herman’s Hermitts.
with a psychodeiic edge.” Foldy
considered this very encouraging.

‘The third ban‘d consists of
Joseph Woelfel. and his sons. '
This band is predominantly pro-
gressivc rock.

Music has influenced Foldy’s
life immensely. He even managed
to fuse the harmonics theory and
music together. The theory came
about, he said, because “it seem—

municatons-,,or interaction the

interact.”

The academic side of Foldy
ranges from researcher to instruc-
tor. He has taught interpersonal
communication for the past three
years,. and is now also teaching
group communication. He said he
considers teaching “a lot of fun.“
and enjoys interacting with his
students. .

It may seem like such a busy
schedule would leave no time for

, a social life, however, Foldy said,

"I havea surprising amount of
spare time to myself." He has a
very optimistic outlook on life,
explainng. “I don’t consider
anything I d0'work. The way I
look at it, I’m getting paid to
play.”

When asked to describe
himself, Foldy replied, “I am so-
meone who is genuinely happy.”
