 

Mayoral race:
Louis Russo

Republican

The city of Albany can hardly be
described as inviting to Republicans.
For over sixty years the city has been
controlled by a Democratic machine.
and today the tradition continues.

So much so, in fact. that the
Republican challenger to Mayor
Thomas Whalen says outright that he's
running not to win but to keep the idea
of a two-party system alive.

Louis Russo. who won the chance to
oppose Whalen only over the objections
of the Albany County Republican
leadership. has spent about $350 on his
campaign, as opposed to Whalen’s
$80,000.

And Russo further jeapordized his
standing when he told a reporter that
Albany’s low-income housing projects
ought to be blown up. He later insisted
he’d only meant to say the projects were
the wrong environment to raise a family
in.

Bill on the issue that probably more
directly concerns stttdettts than any
other, Russo is sending a clear message.

“i can’t understand this city ad-
ministration. where are the young peo-
ple going to go?" he asked. referring to
the Whalen administration's aggressive
pursuai of the Grouper Law.

The law forbids more than three
unrelated people to live together in the
same apartment or house.

Russo said the solution to Albany's
housing crunch and downtown over-
crowding problems is to get more state
funds to build dormitories at SUNYA.
“The state administration is the pro-
blem." he said. adding “The city should
let things rest."

Fewer students is not the answer. said
Russo. “I don't think they should cut
down on enrollment." instead. he sug-
gested the state could set up emergency
housing facilities on campus, such as
trailers used to house natural disister
victims.

Russo avoided outright criticism of
Whitlcn‘s redevelopment push in
downtown Albany. but (lid say. "A lot
of this was already on the books, and
was already moving under Mayor
Coming."

"The local machine is working on
Pearl Street." said Russo. explaining
that he believed attention should be
focused on the Central Avenue shopp-
ing district. Putting money into the
older homes and brownstone districts in
Albany is. said Russo. “like putting
lipstick on an old prostitute.“

Editor's note: For most of the off-campus
and Alumni Quad districts where students
are concentrated there is only one person
running for the Board of Alders. the city’s
major legislative body. However. in the
Fifteenth Ward, which includes the up-
town campus with the greatest concentra-
tion of students. incumbent Nicholas Col-
uceio is being challenged by Richard Bar-
rett. What follows is a quick summary of
interviews held with each candidate or his
supporters. '

the Pinebush.

Mulvihill said Barrett feels the Grouper
Law is unfair to students because of its ar-
bitrariness. and that rather than protecting
students front unsafe housing conditions,
it forces them to break city law.

“He either wants the Grouper Law
repealed or he wants it changed to a law
that helps the students,” she said.

“As far as Nick Colluccio.” said
Muivihiii. “nothing's being done" to
spare students from the results of the law's
enforcement.

Barrett has been endorsed by the “Save
the Pinebush" Organization in recognition
of his committment to their cause.

Nicholas Coluceio

Running for his third term to Albany’s
Board of Alders, Coluceio thinks he has a
strong record of working with students in
his district. and he's willing to reach across
the years to illustrate his points.

Coluceio pointed to this fall’s polling
place issue, in which. he said. he sponsored
a resolution moving the polling place to
the Thruway House after SA ofﬁcials in~
formed him of the safety issues involved if
the polling place was left several miles up
Washington Avenue at a nursing home.

“i worked very closely with the
students." he said, adding.“‘they have a

right to vote where they live and this where'

they live.”

“Anything they (students) come to me
for i will be there for them." promised
Coluceio. mentioning the Party in the
Park issue of a few years ago. when he said
he was the only Alder out of 15 to argue an
alcohol permit which had been revoked
should be reissued. The case was settled
after SA went to court and won.

He said he sees part of his role as a con-
flict mediator between the city administra~
tion and students. which he estimated are
2.500 of his 6.000 constituents.

As for Albany's Grouper Law, Coluceio
said. “There's pros and cons to it.” While
he said he was concerned that students
were paying high rents and receiving little
for their money. “we want to keep the
landlords in compliance with the city
law." — J.F.0'S.

   

 

 

Mayoral race:

Thomas Whalen
Democrat

 

By James F. O’Sulllvan
NEWSEDITOR A
(WITH WIRE SERVICES REPORT) ‘

When Erastus Corning ll died in 1983
after a 41-year tenure as mayor of
Albany. some felt successor Thomas
Whalen would be little more than a
caretaker.

Since then. Whalen has solidiﬁed his
hold on city government. kept potential
Democratic rivals at bay and ﬁnds
himself waging his ﬁrst mayoral race
against Louis Russo. the Republican
challenger who states he has no chance
of winning.

Whalen began making his mark in
Corning’s last year, which for Corning
was limited mostly to hospital beds. The
mayor-designate began :introducing
modern management techniques to
replace an old-boy network which had
run the city since the forties and earlier.

“To some of the older party func-
tionaries, i appeared like a revolu~
tionary." Whalen said. “i think a lot of
people viewed me as a caretaker mayor
and I chose not to be."

not want to be a long-term mayor, he
does plan on winning this election. So
far. his campaign has spent an estimated
380.000 on the practically uncontested
race.

And next year the city celebrates its
tricentennial at a time when the city's
once blighted downtown area is making
a comeback.

Whalen. however, has more than
once found himself under fire from stu-
dettt leaders at SUNYA. He and former
Student Association President Rich
Schaf fer had a running name-calling
battle in the media in 1983, and Whalen
was an outspoken foe against allowing
students to vote in their college
communities.

Today, Whalen is perhaps best known
among students for his redredging up of
Albany’s Grouper Law, and for his
subordinate. Code Enforcement Direc-
tor Michael Alvaro's vigorous move to
enforce the law which prohibits more
than three unrelated people over the age
of 18 from living in the same. housing
unit.

The sparks. however. have not ignited
as SA leaders have made a conscious at-
tempt to improve community-student
relations, through trash collection drives
and other neighborhood oriented
projects.

in fact. Whalen is expected to be the
big pull at SUNYA‘s “Meet the Can-
didates Night” this Sunday evening in

 

the Campus Center Ballroom.

 

Although Whalen has stated he does

Kennedy won 'the Pulitzer Prize for
literature in 1982 for his novel Ironwood.
which was published after being rejected
13. times by other publishing houses. The
novel was published as a series which also ~
includes Billy Phelan's Greatest Game and
Legs, all of which describe historical
ALbany and its people. . V .

Gene Garver, chair of SUNYA’s English .
Department. introduced Kennedy by call-
ing him “the literary laureate of this city
and of this university.” Kennedy opened
the discussion by reciting the first two
paragraphs of his latest work Quinn’s
Book. which he has been writing on and-
off since 1977. Kennedy chided himself by
saying he was “far too ambitious at the
beginning of this project." I h ,

"One must not be too timid about
writing a book." he said, “but a writer
must also become aware of his own
limitations.”

Wednesday’s forum was “a discussion
of craft and creation," said Kennedy. who
spoke about the various aspects of writing
a novel. including problems of style,
“Mental blocks." said Kennedy. "usually
occur when you haven’t paid sufficient'at-
tention to the material. You can overload
your imagination and inventiveness." .

"if you write something and it just lays
there like an egg. you either rewrite it or
you abandon it altogether." he said. “If it
hatches. then you have a ’ chicken. or‘

Kennedy. 'who worked as 'a journalist
before going into teaching. said "Jour-
nalism allowed me to get into any situation
I wanted to get into. For awhile, it was the
oniy‘way l_ could 'stay alive — i could make
a living without getting bored." he said.
“Journalism also gave me a chance to
work with the language everyday." he
said. "Journalism is very good training-
ground for writers." said Kennedy. ex-
plaining. “There are editors who can teach

you how to write.

"Fiction." said Kennedy. “is somewhat
of a spontaneous desire to create. Then
you hope for the best. There’s also strong
subliminal motivation one the part of the
writers to reconstruct reality into a world
which is more suitable for them.”

Most of Kennedy’s writings deal with

, Albany in the 19th Century. “Albany was

a great town at the turn of the century.”

said Kennedy. “I’m trying to be as faithful

as 1 can to an extraordinary city." _
“The past is‘_whata2 makes my imagina-

tion run."whe said. adding that “i think (it .

interests me because I already know how it
came out.” "  ' ’ ‘

Having taught writing courses for
several years, Kennedy is familiar with the
growth process that is necessary for all
young writers . to experience. “Their
goodness comes from their decision to
stick with Writing and keep writing until
their talent emerges.” he said.

“The mythological element was
something put into the books after i relaiz-
ed that imitation journalism just wasn’t
enough." said Kennedy. “There is a need
to break conventional reality." he said.
adding "reality mustpe deﬁned by its own
terms. You need a sense of the space you
are writing about. You need to make the
reader believe that they are in a real place
with real people and then it is possible to
conve real emotion." ‘ D
