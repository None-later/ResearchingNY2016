By E. Paul Stewart

MINOMWAWMRSEDITDR

Before I begin with the theme of this week’s col-
umn, I would like to introduce myself to you. the
reader. I arn'E. Paul Stewart, the New Minority Af-
fairs Editor of the Albany Student Press. I have
been involved in a number of activities here on this
campus, among which are the Albany State Univer-
sity Black Alliance and Central

Council. I feel fortunate for this Beyond
opportunity to voice minority 

concerns and encourage minority a
awareness on this. campus.

There are a great many pro- 
blems which face Blacks and Hispanics in this coun-
try and here on this campus. Among these are dif-
ﬁculty in obtaining an education (which will be
discussed in a future column). poor/bad media
representation. unemployment. and countless other
socioeconomic problems. There is one maior pro-
blem. though. which is not often dealt with. That
problem is sensitivity.

Too often. too many people claim they “unders-
tand” the problems that minorities experience.
“know what it must be like." and claim they are
sensitive to the needs of and have the answers for
blacks and Hispanics in America. As a member of
an ethnic minority. I find many of the people dis-
dainful. to say the least.

There are people who do securineg empathize-

with minority concerns and who are sincere in their
desire to help these people and I applaud. But those
others who are merely professors of sensitivity. 1
can only express my sincere desire that your words
can someday be made manifest into positive ac-
tions. such as listening and active support.

And there are several professors at SUNYA who
are “self-proclaimed liberals." They insist that they
are concerned and show this by “talking down" to
minority students and making many assupmtions
about particular students’ backgrounds on the basis
of their race, creed. or color.

These assumptions are often based on stereotypes
depicted in the poor media image" that has been
created to portray Blacks and Hispanics. Many pro-
fessors assume that all minorities come from
broken homes. are on welfare, play basketball and
need remedial work in every subject. A student
friend of mine recently complained to me of a pro-
blem that he is currently experiencing with a
professor.

The professor insists that he has an understan-
ding of Blacks and uses this student as an example
(subjecting the student to ridicule and humiliation).
The professor constantly names sports ﬁgures and
entertainers such as Michael Jackson to give the Im-
pression that he is "in tune" with Black America.

This professor has conveyed messages to my
friend to suggest that as a student who is black, my
friend is automatically inferior. He always refers to
his teaching experience in the slum area of a major
US. city and dictates what image blacks must fit to
reach his idea of ‘their place in society.‘ Even if he

possesses a modicum of sincerity in his feelings
toward the black community.hc loses all credibility
in his approach.

Minority students are aware of the problems in
their communities and their problems of broken
homes. etc.. do exist, but we do not all as in-
dividuals suffer precisely the same plight. It is our
ethnic heritage that makes us alike. it is the societal
chains that bind us.

“It is our ethnic
heritage that makes us
alike, it is the societal

chains that bind us.”

Our individual personal dilemmas may be similar
in some cases. but those are not our only restraining
afﬂictions. There are solutions but they will come
from within our community. they can’t be dictated
from outside. Sincere. earnestly concerned people
are appreciated and welcomed. it is the self pro-
claimers we are weary of. .

Only the minority can know to the fullest extent
the struggle for life at a predominantly white school
in a predominantly white country.

Black Solidarity Day

On Monday, November 4, 1985. Albany State
University Black Alliance (ASUBA) will be once
again hosting its annual Black Solidarity Day.

Black Solidarity is a national event for Black
Americans to come together and demonstrate their

support for their communities. On this day. non-

minority owned businesses are. boycotted as a
demonstration of the economic power which stems
from the black community.

There is a list of events planned for the day,
which begins at 11 am. in the Campus Center
Ballroom and runs until 9 pm. Forfurthcr infor-
mation call ASUBA at 442-5678.

If is important that Black students participate in
this even inordcr to learn more about what's hap-
pening with Black people in other schools (there

' will be visiting students) and throughout the world.

It is also imperative that non-Black students make
an attempt to sensitize themselves to the Black ex-
perience in America and more precisely the Black
students here on this campus.

Black Solidarity Day is a learning experience for
all students and an opportunity that should not be
missed. We shall all leave this campus eventually.
let's leave with a better understanding of each
other. - CI
