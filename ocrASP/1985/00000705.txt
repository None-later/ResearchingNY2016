Over 900 students attend SUNYA Pre-Law Fair

By Evan Weissman
STAFF WRITER

Over 900 students and about 30
law schools participated in Law
Fair Day Wednesday, prompting
Neil Garfinkel, President of

SUNYA's Pre-Law Association.

to term the event a “great
success."

The fair, which was held in the
Campus Center Ballroom, drew
its largest turnout ever, Garfinkel
said.

According to Marion Rothbart,
admissions counselor at the
Delaware Law School of Widener
University, law schools par-
ticipate at fairs like this “to ex-
pose ourselves to others outside
of our immediate geographical
area."

As to what they learn about
SUNYA students, Rothbart
replied, “We learn a little bit
about the majors and the
geography of the students.”
However, no stereotype is placed
on SUNYA students from their
appearance at the fair, she added.

Law Schools, like New York
University School of Law and St.
John‘s University School of Law,
agree that undergraduates may
major in any of a variety of areas
if they wish to pursue a career in
law.

“Students should be well-
rounded," said Rothbart, but
should not look for the easy A.
“Law School sprefer to see an A
in a tougher and more rigorous
course like Chemistry or another
science over an easy A course.”

Law Fair Day gave those school
shtat are not well known an op-
portunity to expose themselves to
students, said Bill Murphy, Vice

President of the Pre-Law Asocia-
tion. “it is a chance [for students]
to view the various schools,” and
to begin looking for the schools
they will want to apply to. Mur-
phy said.

When commenting about the
fair, Danny Hume, a SUNYA
student interested in law, said that

also listed several examples of
possible events that would not in~
volve alcohol. “All quads tradi-
tionally do a play of some sort,"
Smirti said. “lndian Quad is
planning to perform a second
play, The Odd Couple," he
added.

Smirti mentioned a midnight
bus trip to feast on Chinese Food
in Manhattan. a Chippendale
night in the CC Ballroom and a
night skiing trip to Vermont as
other possible activities.

Smirti said that lndian Quad
has started a cultural awareness
program. There was an interna-
tional film festival on Wednes-
day, October 30. “Other events
that are being considered as part
of the cultural awareness program
are a belly dancing demonstration
or lesson and bus trips to ethnic
neighborhoods to sample the
food," Smirti said,

“The change in the drinking
age will change things for some
students who only relax by having
a few drinks. Other people adapt
more easily.“ The change “may
force us to come up with better

and more creative ideas," said
Smirti.
Smirti noted that parties

haven’t been very successful dur-

“all information one hears isn’t
always accurate. You learn about
the many schools, see what to
shoot for, and [investigate] what
programs to take."

The fair allows students to
discover what schools are looking
for in prospective applicants and.
to set their goals accordingly.

ing this semester. He cited a party
on lndian which attracted 75
students, one on Dutch which was
attended by 15 and a Colonial
Quad party of 23. “There is a
general trend of students moving
away from alcohol and drink-
ing,” Smirti said.

Martone cntended that “there
is an overemphasis on alcohol as
the only way to have fun.” he'ad-
ded “1 think students are more

orientation, with the help of the
summer planning conference peo-
ple, and who go door to door on
election day that SUNYA has
such a high turnout," he said.

During last year’s registration,
the New York Public interest
Research group (NYPlRG), was
responsible for registering over
2,000 students, but this year
NYPIRG considered voter
registration “barely a priority,”
said Hartman.

According to Stacey Young,
Project Coordinator of NYPlRG
at SUNYA, voter registration was
not given top priority by
NYPlRG’s State Board of Direc-
tors. This group, all students,
determines the issues that the
organiztion‘works on, as a whole.

Law schools were surprised and
enthused about SUNYA’s fair,
Garfnkel said.

The last fair was held in
Syracuse and was not as suc-
cessful, Garfinkel said. “We had
to kick people out because they
didn‘t want to leave at the closing

creative than that.”
Martone also noted
students are more conscious of
“wellness” now than in the past.
He said that an alcohol awareness
program exists to educate
students about alcohol “not from

a preaching or moralistic view-‘

point but from one of health.”

He added “we need to make .

students more aware of the effects

of alcohol on their minds and.

year NYPIRG has turned its
energy in other directions. She
cited anti-apartheid and financial
aid programming as examples.

SUNYA has an excellent accep-

students have a large stake in the

that the quality of academic in-

“We hope that students would

been attracting big name bands playing
in the area. RPl's concert board has felt I

“They‘re doing a lot of big name peo-
pic at a good price," said Caloccia. ,
“They seem to be good shows."
Seligson said “between RPl, ‘J.B.s

This fa11,-Seligson said, UCB has put
on several shows including Dickey Betts,
the Wailers”, and Paul Young. Al
DiMeola is scheduled to appear
November 6 at the Palace Theatre. '

UCB shows last year, according to N

. Seligson, included the Blasters, Lou
Reed. Zebra, Santana, Jean Luc Ponte, '
General Public, U340, and Julian
Lennon.

' Also, Otis Day and the Nights played
at Mayfest last spring along with the
Tubes and Utopia. V I

When asked what bands UCB might
get for this spring, Seligson said, “I'm
waiting, things change in the music
business.”

' “1.know ABC and Simple Minds will
be touring this spring," said Seligson,
“But i don’t know the dates." He add-
ed that “if nothing else comes up, we
won't have another show this fall."

_ “A lot of people ask how.we get
bands.” Seligson said. “1 work through ‘
middle agents and get a list of the bands’
availabilities," he explained. “There are
bands available of every kind."

1y 75 members, Seligson said. _
Seligson stressed that people should
not complain about the shows UCB puts
on. “if you don't come down to the
meetings, you don’t have a voice,” he
said. “We pay our workers with com-
plimentary tickets,” added Seligson.
"This keeps people involved."
Caloccia, when comparing the con-
cert boards athPl and SUNYA, said
that “there is a big difference between
them.“ He added that “we depend on
people from the area to go to the shows.

. . We leave a lot of good seats at the shows

for non-students."

.Caloceia pointed out that UCB when
presenting shows at the Palace Theatre
holds the three center sections on the
floor for SUNYA students, leaving the
remaining two side sections on the floor

, open to the public.

UCB also reserves the first' of three
balconies at the Palace Theatre for
SUNYA students only, Caloccia said.

“I have seen a reaction from the local
press because of this," said Caloccia.
He suggested that the press "won’t

_ cover a show that's all inside SUNYA."

Caloccia said that at UCB concerts,
non-SUNYA student concert goers
“have less of a chance to get tickets with
their system, and worse, they're paying
through the nose to go.

UCB “gets no local press because no
one will be able to see their shows except
SUNYA students; they won't cover it at
all.” said Callocia.

RPI Concer Board lets RPI students

buy show tickets a day ahead of time,

according to Caloccia. “We leave a lot
of good seats for non-RPI students,"
said Caloccia. When RPI Concert
Board puts on a show at the Palace
Theatre, Caloccia said, “We only pull
one section. This gives the public more
incentive to go." ~

nout is aiinatter of advertising. “We get “

a lot of good press in Metroland,” said
Dales, adding that this “attracts an out-
side audience."

Dales ‘said, so far this year, RP! has
had Howard Jones, Supertramp, Lon-
nie Brooks, the Voltage Brothers, and
The Sharks. Bo Didley is scheduled to
play December 7-. ~

The concert board at RPl differed
from UCB, Dales said, because of its
small size. This year, it has only 30
members. ' '

“You know everybody you are deal-
ing with and you get a lot of things done
quickly," said Dales.

Seligson defended UCB saying that
“maybe the public does get better seats

. at RP], but we are a student organiza-
tion, and that’s what we work for.

“We want students to get the better
seats," he added. '

“They're geared to gettng the
public," Seligson said of RPl' Concert
Baord, “while we attract-students."

“We could do shows at the RH field
house, but there is a stigma toward
SUNYA using RPI‘s ﬁeldhouse," said
Seligson. ‘

According to Nirenberg, students were
standing in front of the room at the same

time that the firefighters knocked the glass

out. “There was no warning to the
students standing outside," he said, ad-
ding thet “the area was not taped off."

Denise Cutrone, who was standing out-
side the room, said that before the
firefighters threw the burnt mattress and
other damaged items out the window, the
area had already been taped off.

According to Marcolini, students who

management anticipated he would be
bigger than he is, they thought he would
ﬁll the 7,000 seats :1 RH.”

The Howard Jones concert in October '
at the RH ﬁledhouse only sold 3,200
tickets, Seligson noted that if Jones had
played for SUNYA’s UCB at the Palace
Theatre, “we would have had a sold out
show." ‘

Seligson said the concert boards at
SUNYA and RP] differ in that “they
[RPl] have to make money. We don't
make money on any concert.

“We are budgeted to lose money,”
said Seligson. “This enables us to
charge less to the students."

‘ Seligson pointed out that the dif-
ference in hall size at RH and SUNYA,
noting that the ﬁeldhouse holds 7,000
while SUNYA's Gym and the Palace
Theatre only hold 3,000 each. “i think
the Palace Theatre and the gym are big
enough,” said Seligson, “A show loses
something in the size."

Students who lived on the ﬁrst floor
weren't permitted back into their rooms
until 4:30 p.m., Marcolini said, due to the
heat and the time needed to re'set the alarm

Zirkel said that the residents of Suite 102
