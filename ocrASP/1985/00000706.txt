Peoria, Illinois

COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE — Police officers

' “have come to :the door on a noise com-

plaint, and have just walked in, and

started carding people,">complained Mike

Forman, Interfraternity Council president

at Bradley-University. “They don‘tvhave
the right to do that without a Warrant."

They may in fact have the right, and col-
leges across the country are using it more
to keep a much closer eye on students this
fall as the nationwide crackdown on sttl'-
dent drinking begins its second year.

Some critics fret the crackdown,
however, may scuttle campus “responsible
drinking" programs, forcing many
students off campus—— and into their
cars— to drink in less-controllable, more
dangerous situations.

And while observers can’t agree of
tougher regulations and stricter enforce-
ment actually are changing student drink-
ing habits, campuses’switch to more ag-
gressive anti-drinking tactics this fall is
beyond question:

— At Indiana University. the dean of
students makessuprisc visits to campus
parties to find underaged drinkers and en-
force a new campus keg policy.

— Yale now effectively prohibits
alcohol at many campus events, and issues
students “drinking cards” to help enforce
the new rules.

—— Local police broke up traditional
school-opening parties at West Virginia
and Western Michigan, arresting some 42

' students the first week of classes at West
Virginia.

— Pittsburgh police have warned stu-
dent groups they will drop into University
of Pittsburgh parties unannounced to en-
force new drinking age laws.

— University of Florida administrators
made a point of holding a public hearing
into alleged violations of their new dry
rush rules the very first week of school.

— Bradley ofﬁcials had two students ar-

rested for'violati'ng, drinking rules during,

their ﬁrst week of cla‘sses,too. ‘

Boston 'University,
Berkeley, Penn State, San Diego State,
Kentucky and Arizona,‘ among scores of
other campuses; have adopted stricter

' rules for student drinking this fall.

At Sinith College, for example,

underaged drinkers 'h‘o longer can get legal ‘
help from the college. Students can’t have '

liquor on dorms at South Dakota'state
schools anymore, while Penn ‘State
restricts the kinds of parties that can have
kegs.

difficulty of buying liability insurance
without proving they’re tryingrt'o enforce
the rules. ‘ ‘

No one is sure how much the crackdown
is changing student drinking.

“The keg is still the major focus of a
party, but there is a trend toward more
responsible use of alcohol on our cam-
pus," notes Harold Reynolds, director of
student affairs. at Cal-Berkeley.

“There are some disgruntled views
about the ban on alcohol, but we are living
with it," says George Kuntz, president of
the lnterfraternity and Sorority Council at
Boston University. ,

“In the past, ten people would work on
the homecoming committee. We has
thirty-five this year. There is a deﬁnite in-
crease in participatipn in school events. It
has worked phenominally well," Kuntz
says of the new alcohol regulations.

“I wouldn't say consumption has gone
down in our house, but there is more
awareness of the potential abuses of
alcohol,” said Mike Allen, president of
Delta Tau Delta at the University of
Missouri-Colunbia. ‘

At Yale, “there will be fewer large par-
ties," predicted Mark Watts, of Yale’s

Southern Cal, ’

:elubéope-ns year at Binghamton

By Lisa Jackal
STAFF WRITER ‘

The Albany men's hockey club will
travel to Binghamton tonight not knowing
what to'cxpect from their opponent. As
this is the first season that the club will be
playing against Division III schools in the
ICHL league, they are unfamiliar with
their competition. , ' .

The Danes face more vigorous opposi-
tion than last year against such schools as
Cortland, Siena, and Niagara.

“We never played Binghamton before,
so we don’t know what to expect," said
club president and center Paul Essner, “If
everyone plays up to their potential — as
expected, we will beat them. We just have

to use our heads and make no mistakes." .

According to Essner, the club possesses
few weaknesses and has gained a more
balanced attack. ‘

This year, the club has a lot of speed,
skill and strength equally distributed
among each line. “Last year, we had a few
superstars, but this year we have a lot of
good players and the talent is equally pro-
portional on each line,” said left wing
Mike Mondiello.

There are many strong skaters this
season. “We'll have six solid people on ice
at all times," said center Rick Dien, “We
have twenty-two smart hockey players who
all know hockey." _ g ,

Due to a city ordinance requesting that
the rink devote more time to the public,
the Danes have only four ice practices
behind them. They had hoped to be on ice
by the beginning of October, but. didn’t get

on until the 18th. This lack of ice time ..

might hurt them as they have eight new
players (sixf rosh),.and..could have used the

time to get used to the system, working .

together and forming the best possible
combinations among players.

The Danes are optimistic though, as v

they are not going to let this effect them.

“We can't avoid playing a game just
because of limited practice." commented
Essner. “Once we startplaying and think-
ing nothing but hockey, instinct will take
over and everything will come together."

In addition to stronger players the team
has gained two terriﬁc coaches. Bruce
Pomakoy took over as head coach last
January when Jim Cavanagh left for a job
ofﬁce in Rockland County.

“Pomakoy didn’t voice much authority
last year as he was just getting to know us
and wanted to be liked by the team.”
stated Diem, “This year, however, he set
the tone from day one." ‘

“Pomakoy and his assistant, Ed Rosen,
are well organized and work us hard," said
goalie Jim Leskody. “Knowing they are
fully'backed by the players, they voice
their authority and push us to our limit.”

Binghamton is in the same position since
they to don’t know what to expect from
their opponent in this case, Albany. “We
have no expectations for Friday's game as
we’ve never played Albany,” stated
Binghamton coach John Stella. “We'll
just have to play it by ear."

“We’ve prepared as best as possible
with the limited amount of ice," also
stated Stella. Besides tryouts the Bingham-
ton team has only had six practices on ice
but which is-still more'than Albany’s has
had.

Last year'was Binghamton’s first year in
ICHL and their record was 5-13. They
competed against western teams such as

" Niagara college, Niagara University, Buf-

fallo State, St. Bonaventure and the
University of Rochester.

Outstanding Binghamton players are
Co-Captains and centers Chris Braglia and
Mike Odonnelo. _, .

“Not only are they strong players, but
they are leaders on ice," said Stella.
Binghamton has aquired talented transfers
to fill key positions.

Albany submitted its compliance form
for NCAA competition late, thus
eliminating all Albany teams from nation-
wide polls. Albany’s poor performance in
the lthaca tournament may also lessen
their chances. ,

However. the Danes were ranked'tenth
in the pre-season poll. In addition, they
have competed in the NCAAs the past
three years. If the Danes play well in the
SUNYACs this Saturday and the state
championships at Potsdam next weekend,

weekend there were any problems,” said
Dwyer.

The winner of the SUNYACs receives an
automatic bid to the NCAAS. Albany's
pool will consist of Cortland, Geneseo,
and Binghamton. However, Dwyer is not
concerned about the Cortland match.
Two, three, and possibly four teams from
the northeast will be eligible to compete in
the NCAA’s 24 team field .

“From what I can see, everybody is con-
fident about the SUNYACs. We’ve been
working for weeks really hard at practice,
giving it our best, " said Neaton.
