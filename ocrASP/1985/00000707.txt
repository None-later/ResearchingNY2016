Albany-netmen finishseason:withgﬂezrttecord

All good things must come to
an end. Such is the case for the
Albany State men's tennis season.

The Danes season ended Oc—
tober 14 on a sour note. Their
record dropped to 8-2 after losing
to powerhouse University of
Vermont.

“Vermont is a better team. we
didn't play real well,
psychologically we weren’t into
it," Head Tennis Coach Bob
Lewis said. “We were anti-
climactic after the SUNYACs."

Vermont finished ahead of the
Danes two previous times this
58850“.

The only other loss for the team
this season was to Army. Lewis
said. “i think that if we'd played
Army later in the season we
would have beaten them.”

The lack of practice time early
in the season hurt Albany in that
match. it was Lewis’, “only real
disappointment of the season."

Albany's claim to fame,
without a doubt, was their
seventh straight SUNYAC title.

Freshman Bob Siracuse secured
his spot at sixth singles after win-
ning that flight in the
tournament.

“My final match was really
tough. 1 lost the first one but won
the next two. it was good com-
petition." Siracuse added. “win-
ning the SUNYACs for the
seventh year in a row would be
the highlight of the season. Lots
of the seniors wanted it."

The Danes made strong show-
ings in the ECACs as well as the
Great Dane Classic. They placed

third out of a 27 team ﬁeldin the
ECAC tournament, ﬁnishing in
front of rival Rochester. The
third place finish more than pleas-
ed Lewis who didn’t, expect the
team to place as high. Two singles
and two doubles victories were
the unexpected factors in . the
third place finish.

At the Great Dane Classic the
Dane‘s placed fourth in a field of
sixteen teams. They finished
behind Concordia. Rochester and
Vermont in that tournament.

Co-captains Jay Eisenberg and
Tom Schmitz were outstanding
this season. Also playing con-
sistently were David Grossman.
David Zobler, Mike Dermansky
and Siracuse.

it will be a sad September next
year for the netmen without
Seniors Grossman, Schmitz,
Eisenberg, Dermansky and
Gerber. The fearsome five will be
back for their final collegiate
season in the spring.

Zobler was definitely the most
improved this season. Zobler
played sixth and seventh during
the 1984 season. This year.
hungrier than ever. he secured the
fourth singles spot.

Although the netmen won't be
seen competing outdoors for a
while they can frequently be
found working out at Capitolland
Racquet Club. They may also be
spotted working out in the gym
with Coach Lewis.

The indoor athletic facility be-
ing built next to the gym will have
room for three tennis courts.
“We hope we’ll be able to
schedule time to use it for indoor
workouts, but we don’t know

what the situation will. be.” said

Lewrs.

Ironically the 1984 season was
very similar to this years. The
team supported a 7-2 fall record

and lost to Army and Vermont

Both seasons the team won the

imppssible.“

One of the conditions in quali-
fying for the NCAA tournament
is allowing no losses. Because
Albany had too many teams on its
. spring schedule a match against
Vermont was dropped.

SUNYACs and placed third at the

ECACs. They bettered

ﬁnish.

“Our‘ goal now is to try to
qualify as a team for the NCAAs.
it is an outside chance but we'll
work for it," said Lewis. He add~

their
seventh place ﬁnish at the Great
Dane Classic to a fourth place

Albany has a disadvantage
compared to big name tennis
schools such as Cornell and Con-
cord in that they and other
schools have bubbles with indoor
tennis.

Last year Albany sent the
doubles team of Grossman and

season,” White said. “1 don’tfeel
she’s anywhere near her
potential."

Junior Brenda Watson was
named “Outstanding Runner of
the meet"in what Coach White
called, “a super race." She shat-
tered her previous season best by
21:05 at the Hartwick meet by
running 19:54 over the Abany
course . .

Also coming on strong late in
the season is junior Carol Bart.
Bart destroyed her Capital

District meet time 21:27.87 with a '

20:51 ﬁnish Saturday. For that
performance she- was named
“Honorable Mention Runner of
the Meet." ' '
The women runners now have
time off until their next compiti-
tion on November 9 when Smith

College will mark the site of the
ECACs. The ECACs should pre-
sent a different challenge to
Albany. . . .

"At Smith we’ll‘face a com-
pletely different team lineup.”
Jacobs said. “it’s really hard to
predict how we’ll do there since

Grossman also qualiﬁed to play
in the singles competition.

The netmen will not make a
formal debut until the last week in
March. Using money raised with
eyeguard sales, t-shirts and alum-
ni contributions the Danes will
travel to Atlanta, Georgia. While
in Atlanta they will compete
against four local teams.

1f practice this winter and com-
petition next spring go well, the
netmen may have a chance at
playing in the NCAAs in Califor-
nia and who knows the SUNYAC
dynasty may turn, into NCAA. El

we haven't seen' most 01' those
teams yet this season."

Training tactics until the meet
will stress lots of mental
preparation.

As for the question on
everyone’s mind. will Albany
qualify a team or individual run-
'ners for the NCAAS, the answer
is a mystery. 11' Pettichord, Kur-
thy and Jacobs run strong they
may have individual chances.

The matter of which teams
qualify will “be amatter of who’s
the hungriest."said White. E]

Blazing to victory in style. the Albany

' State women‘s cross country team with the

home course advantage on their side, plac-
ed ﬁfth in a ﬁeld of fourteen teams in the
New York State 'cross country meet last
Saturday. ' '

The women runners appear to be mak-
ing a gradual procession towards peaking
with each meet. The 1984 team ' ran
anywhere from second through ﬁfth in
major cross country meets. By the time the
regional qualiﬁer for the NCAA compiti-
tion was held the barriers were ready. They
had reached that desired peak. ’

Hopefully the 1984‘sequencc of events
will repeat in 1985. The possibilities are
likely. This season the Danes have placed
respectany in every meet.

Although the team placed fifth Saturday
it was by a narrow, margin. Only 13 points
separated the second through ﬁfth place
teams.

1thaca won the meet with.33 points. in
the last nationwide p011 Ithaca was ranked
ﬁfth. V .

Next was Cortland placing second with
86 points. Geneso, Rochester and Albany.

Terrible.

That was the adjective head coach Bob
Schieffelin used to describe his team's per-
formance in the ﬁrst round of the Univer-
sity Center Championships last weekend, a
game in which Binghamton blanked the
Albany State men’s soccer team. 6-0.

“We deﬁnitely expected that we’d play
better," said Schieffeiin. “Going into the
tournament we felt as though we had a
good chance to win."

The Danes were the fourth-seeded team
of the tournament that included. in addi-
tion to themselves and top-seeded
Binghamton. Buffalo, the eventual win-
ner, and Stony Brook, who defeated the
Danes 4-2 in the consolation round to take
third. Binghamton took second.

According to Schieffeiin. the game was
over for the Danes only one minute after it
began, as Binghamton scored on a penalty
shot.

I‘That early goal really go us down, it
had a. steamroller effect on us,” said
Schieffeiin. “in essence, that‘s what
happened.“

“The call for a penalty shot was pretty
much undeserved.” said Co-Captaln Carl
1005. “What should have been awarded in
that situation was an indirect free‘kick."

The Dane freshman factor. which has
been hampering Albany throughout the
season was another contributing reason
for the loss. ,

seconds.

as ever, placing 18th overall for the Danes.

Following Defeo was senior Lynn
Jacobs. Her 19:06 was good enough for a
let place ﬁnish.

Making a tremendous comeback was co-
captain Bette Dzamba. Her 24th place
ﬁnish showed what remarkable determina-
tion site has after coming off a good part
of an injured season. She received
“Honorable Mention Runner of the meet"
for her performance.

Sharing the honorable mention title with

Dzamba was freshman Jackie Phipps. 1n- ‘

“When. you have a team characterized

why we haven’t won more games."

The Dane's final game of the fall 1985
