Great Danes

Going into Saturday's game at
University Field. the Albany State
Great Danes and the Hofstra Fly-
ing Dutchmen are driven by two
very opposite forces.

While the implications of a
Dane loss will prove fatal for their
playoff hopes. the Dutchmen ap-
parcntly just want to have fun.

Having fun might be in order
when your team is 4-3 and going
nowhere fast. like Hofstra. but
the 5-2 Danes have to approach
each of their remaining games as
a do-or-tlic situtation. and
Hofstra’s light-heartedness
doesn't change the magnitude of
this contest.

“There's no pressure on us this
year. the pressure is all on them.
so we‘re going to have fun." said
Hofstra Head Coach Mickey
Kwiatkowski. “We're a pretty
laid-back hunch. so we’re going
to comc up. have fun in the hotel
Friday night and then have fun in
the game on Saturday. We’re the
type of team that. two hours after
the game is over. we don‘t care if
we won, lost. or tied."

Saturday‘s game weighs in-
finitely heavier for the Danes.
however, as their incentive rests
upon knowing that they’ll be
eliminated from post-season play
should they lose any one of their
remaining three games.

“We're obviously motivated.“
said Albany Head Coach Bob
Ford. “We've had a super week
of practice. and we even had a
fight one day, which you don’t
like to see. but at least it shows
they’re on edge."

Kwiatkowski may be taking the
game lightly. but he certainly isn‘t
taking the Danes themselves
lightly.

“Frankly. I don't know how

‘ we're going to put points on the

board against Albany. I look at
the game more as a great
challenge for us,” said
Kwiatkowski. “We feel honored

to play Albany because we're tak-.,

ing an average team up there and
playing against a (possible)
playoff team with national
exposure."

if this year's game resembles
last year’s match-up — a big-play
showcase decided by a
touchdown pass in the final two
minutes to give Hofstra a 35-32
victory — at least the spectators
will have lots of fun.

“That was one of the most ex-
citing college games I’ve been in-
volved with." said Ford. “There
were so many long touchdown
plays. it was actually fun to
watch."

“I would love to see that kind
of game again." said
Kwiatkowski. “it would show
that we can compete with a team
at Albany's level."

With this year’s line-ups. a
repeat performance is not out of
the question. Returning for
Hofstra is quarterback Alan
Squeri. who has a battery of
gazelles to pass to. including
Speedster James Moore at split
end. flanker Lou Palmero. and
tight end Chris Sacas.

“He's a real smart kid, he has
real intellect." said Kwiatkowski
of Squiri. “He can handle any
situation he faces because his
forte is reading defenses. especial-
ly when they're mixing coverages
or shifting around a lot."

And Squeri‘s receiving corps
have the potential to explode for
the big play so frequent in last
year’s game.

“James Moore is our big guy.
but you'll notice that all three are
within three or four total catches

- Hofstra's defense might also con-
"tribute to a highescoring, big-play

shoot~out.
“They have a very aggressive
defense that moves around a lot,”

‘ saidFord, “the kind of defense

that can. allow the big offensive

 play, or create the. .big defensive
 play.”

The Danes‘ main motivation is
staying alive in the playoff pic-
ture. but a certain revenge factor
also exists because Hofstra

_. University is on Long Island, and

losing there last year doesn't sit
well with Albany players from the
Island.

“it's definitely a grudge
match.” said sophomore fullback

boasted Kwiatkowski.

The Danes counter. as always.
with their wishbone offense keyed
by quarterback Mike Milano, but
also a passing attack that tends to
get overlooked in Albany's run-
oriented scheme.

Milano and split end John
Donnelly have demolished the
Albany State record book this
season by topping ‘82 grad Tom

Pratt and ‘83 grad Bob Brien in
numerous categories. Milano has
completed more passes (l3l) than
Pratt (103) for more yardage
(1846 yards to 1398) and more
touchdowns. 19 to Pratt’s I3.
Donnelly's 109] career receiving
yards tops Brien‘s 106l. and he
surpassed Brien’s 67 career recep-
tions last week by adding two cat-
ches to his own total of 67.

Dane spikers to play in SUN YA Cs NCAAC'earS way

The Albsn spikers compote In tho
SUNVACst ls weekend.

The Ithaca tournament marked the first
major downfall the women spikers have
encountered this season.

Things did not start out well for the
Danes. Upon arriving in Ithaca. they
learned that they had to squeeze irtto two
hotel rooms after their previously booked
reservations were not honored due to
homecoming at lthaca and Cornell.

The nervousness began Saturday morn-
ing as Albany walked onto the court. For
the third time this year, Albany was to
meet up with the nation's third ranked
team. Cortland.

Albany won the first match 15-l3, but
fell in the second and third. 15-5. i5-4.

immediately following Cortland. the
Duties faced fourteenth ranked Ithaca.
Albany was no challenge to the Ithaca
team. They were defeated 15-4. 1540.

Meanwhile. the tenseness mounted. St.
Bonaventure was Albany's next and only
victory. They lost the first game 15-l3. but
came back with a l5-7. 15-13 victory over
the Division I team.

After a break. Albany was back on the
court for their final matches. Nazareth
College. which Albany beat last year in the
NCAA’s. was their next opponent. Albany
was confident in the first game. winning
IS-l3. However. the spikers fell lS-O, 15-7
in the other two.

“We didn’t play poorly. but we didn't
play well enough to be a threat to the other
teams.” said Head volleyball coach Pat
Dwycr. “We didn't play that well as a
team."

“The loss wasn't really anything you
could put your hands on," said
sophomore Chris Hofer.

Possible factors for the loss include the
tight hotel conditions. and the lingering ef-
fect of midterms. There was also no break
in between most of the matches for the
players to have a rest.

The spikers must have rested well before
Tuesday's home match against Siena Col-
lege. They crushed the opposition l5-9.
1543, 15-7 in the best three out of five
matches.

“Some people had their best matches all
year." said Dwyer. adding,"i expected us
to win, but was surprised we didn‘t have
more trouble titan we did.”

All of the team members played at least
half a game lit the “pleasing win" for
Dwyer.

The match was “a win we needed to pro-
ve that we can come back." according to
captain Terry Neaton.

Because Albany has not been ranked
since the pre-scnson poll. they may face
hard times in getting a bid to compete in

for Albany teams
to be in playoffs

The late compliance form scandal,
which put the Albany State athletic
team’s playoff chances in peril. was rec-
tified last week.

Athletic Director Dr. William Moore
received a reassuring phone call from
NCAA headquarters in Mission. Kansas
confirming that Albany State will not be
put on probation. which would have
pro ' ‘ted the athletic teams from par-
ticipating in post-season action.

The athletic department was caught
on a technicality. when a compliance
form was received by the NCAA on
September 17. two days past the
deadline. After reviewing the case last
Friday. the NCAA committee voted to
drop the charges against Albany State.

“We're very relieved," Dr. Moore
said. “We didn’t know what was going
to happen because we were never late
before."

The athletic department now know
the possible consequences and, “we'rt
never going to be late again." said Dr.
Moore. ‘
