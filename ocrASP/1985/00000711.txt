Aspects 7a

 

alloween may be gone, but the spirit

of the bizarre and unexpected will

haunt the concert stages of the
Capital District this weekend.

 

Louis Lewis

The area will play host to the New
Music Network Tour, a concert series
featuring nine artists and ensembles perfor-
ming contemporary music from solo piano
compositions to large, formless group im-
provisations, from free-fonn jazz to multi-
media opera.

During November, the tour will repeat
its series in two other regions of the state,
the lower Hudson Valley and western
New York. This affords all New Yorkers
an exposure to the music of their time,
while giving the artists a chance to reach an
audience outside New York City.

"This tour will conclusively prove that
there is no such thing as a single ‘modern'
music or a single trend, but rather a rich
variety of streams of musical thought," said
James Jordan, music director of the New
York State Council on the Arts, which
along with local organizations and Meet
the Composer, is sponsoring the event.

This area's six-concert barrage will begin
tonight at 8 in the Performing Arts Center
Recital Hall, with two highly acclaimed
pianists, Alan Feinberg and Cecil Taylor.
spliting the bill.

Feinberg is a leading interpreter of con-
temporary piano music. He has premiered
a wide range of works, including all those
on tonight’s program, which are considered
extremely challenging, demanding the
highest levels of sensitivity and virtuosity.

Cecil Taylor- is an acknowledged
founder of the jazz avant-garde. After 30
years, he remains a revolutionary figure,
renowned for an intense performance style
and .rapport with the audience. The
dissonance and dense textures of his most-
ly improvised music are balanced with a
vast range of powerful emotional
expression. -

Also taking the stage tonight at 8, at
Union College’s Memorial Chapel, is opera
revolutionary Robert Ashley. A pioneer of
musical theater and multimedia perfor-
mance art (many of his works are for
television) since the 60's, Ashley will pre‘
sent a boileddown'version of his opera
"Atalanta (Acts of God)."

There will be two concerts on Saturday.

Soundt

T his evening four Welshman bring

 

their ra unched-up folk rock sound to
1.8.5 for a performance that promises
to be. . . ALARMing at the very least.

Steve Raspa

The Alarm’s most popular anthemic
songs have been praised by some for their
frankness and condemmed by others for
what has been termed their "junior Clash
pretentiousness." Regardless of positive or
negative evaluation. the fact that these
songs have managed to carve themselves a
permanent groove within today's pan-
theon of pop, remains.

The band first forced its way into the
public arena in 1983 with its attention~
grabbing El’, The Alarm. This release's two
most striking songs, “The Stand" and “Mar-
ching On“ were quickly SWallowed up by
radio and managed to almost immediately
secure the band die-hard fans. The Alarm
rewarded its fans for their early support at
first with an equally rousing string of con
certs and then with the release of its l984
album, Declaration, which contained the
hits "68 Guns.“ “Blaze of Glory,” and
"Where Were You Hiding When the
Storm Broke."

The Alarm has this year released
Strength, an album with a hard-driving
sound that should both please present fans

 

 

 

The first, at the downtown campus Page
Hall at 3 p.m., is a bill split between flutist
Robert Dick and Jane lra Bloom/3D Sax.
Dick is known worldwide for his extraor-
dinary command of flute techniques, in-
cluding multiphonics (playing two or more

notes at the same time), microtones (notes
between the notes), circular breathing and

glissandi. His performance will take on a

vast variety of music, including many of
his own works.

Jane lra Bloom is a noted jazz soprano
sax player and band leader. Her trio in-
cludes bass and synthesizer and other elec-
tronic media. Through exceptional perfor-
mance techniques and high-tech enhance-
ment, the group's improvisations explore
the sonic and musical possibilities of the
saxophone, drawing on jazz, pop, folk and
modern music.

Saturday night at B, the internationally
renowned vocal sextet Western Wind will

eAlarm

and recruit new ones. Of special merit on
this album are “Knife Edge," “Spirit of 76,"
and "Walk Forevér By My Side." ‘

“. . . The band as a whole is
in fact very tight and best
subjectively experienced
rather than described. . . ”

 

 

it is primarily the contributions of Mike
Peter's fervent anthemic vocal style and
Eddie McDonald's energetic bass work that
give the band its characteristic musical bite
and emotional appeal. This is not to deny
that this band is a working unit. The band
as a whole is in fact very tight and best sub
jectively experienced rather than describ-
ed. See them if you can.

Opening for the Alarm is Beat Rodeo, a
band whose country-western twanged
rock has been getting a great deal of atten-
tion these days. The band can be pleasing if
caught on a good night, despite the
vocalist's "God's gift to the world" attitude,
and is worth showing up early for, if for no
other reason than to hear some good guitar
and yodelling. E]

take the stage at Page Hall. Ranging from
medieval to simple folk and challenging
New music, their a capella performance
will include a medley of Duke Ellington
songs and a new work by Robert Dennis.

The Capital Disctrict arm of the tour will
wrap up with two shows on Sunday. A
third split bill will feature the zany im-
provisations of Meltable Snaps it and 20th-
Century performances from Continuum.

Meltable Snaps It is a four-member
group that works with dozens of in-
struments, including reeds, percussion,
electronics and tape effects, voice and
record players. Forsaking the conventions
of melody and rhythm, they create
fonnless, totally spontaneous sound col-
lages infected with plenty of aural and
visual humour, often labeled as an
underground New York City movement,
“art noise." ‘

‘ ,__Continuum was founded in 1967 with

 

 

the philosophy that new music and old
form an unbroken tradition. Dedicated to
expanding the audience for ZOth-Century
music, thay have given hundreds of con-
certs and workshops. The program will in-
clude works by Stravinsky and Robert
Erickson.

Winding up the weekend will be the Art
Ensemble of Chicago, one of the most sen‘ ‘
sational modern jazz groups in existence, at
8 pm. at RPl's West Hall. The Ensemble,
which travels with two tons of acoustic in-
struments from around the world, incor-
porates theater, dance, face paint, costumes
and sharp humor into exhilarating "projec-
tions" that has audiences bopping to jazz,
swinging to Dixieland, grooving to funk.
and‘reggae, mesmerized by African chants
and percussion, astounded by dazzling im-
provisations and cracking up at stage
antics.

Tickets will be available at the door for
all events. ' 1 Cl
