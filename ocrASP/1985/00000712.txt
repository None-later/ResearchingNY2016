Students have encoutcred problems with
bus drivers who have made unauthorized
stops, said Hartman.

There have been instances in which
students reported that bus drivers were
leaving the bus to purchase food or coffee,
he said. He cited one instance at the begin-
ning of the semester where a female stu-
dent was left alone in a running bus when
the driver got out to get a cup of coffee.

“That bus driver was officially
reprimanded" and fined 8100. said Hart-
man, adding that all futureoffenders will
be reprimanded.

Other methods will also be employed to
prevent bus drivers from making
unauthorized stops. said Karen

Kegs and bccrballs could be banned
from suites and rooms on campus as a
result of a new alcohol use policy prpos-
ed by SUNYA Vice President for Stu-
dent Affairs Frnnk Pogue.

Pogue's recommendation follows a
vote by the “implementation of 21"
Committee to allow quarter kegs in
suites. However, a vote by the commit-
tee on half-kegs was tied 5-5. The
group's report was released October 28.

The University must amend its policy
to take into account the new 21 year old
alcohol purchase age, which will become
law in New York State on December 1.

“The ban on bulk containers is the
only difference between the alcohol
policy proposed by the "implementa-
tion of 21' Committee and the policy
proposed by Pogue" said Student
Association Vice President Ross
Abclow, who served on the task force..
“There was a very serious debate

 

about the banning of bulk containers at

the meeting," said Phil Botwinlk, Vice
Chair of SA's Student Action Commit-
tee. “it was the consensus of all students
and administrators that that type of
bulk container policy would be virtually
unenforceable," he said.

“The nature of the recommenda-
tion." said Pogue, "is to place some
limit on the amount of alcohol being
cw hi the rooms. This is being

done." he added. “out of a need to
acknowledge that as much as 82 percent
of the residential population is under the
age of 21."

The proposal will be discussed with a
variety of groups before going to
University President Vincent O'Lcary
for final approval. A University Council
