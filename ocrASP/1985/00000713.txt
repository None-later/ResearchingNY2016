Schultz visits Moscow

Moscow
(AP) Secretary of State George P. Shultz,
winding up 14 hours of “vigorous discus-
sions” with Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
other Soviet ofﬁcials, said today he was
unable to narrow the differences between
the two sides on ways to curb nuclear
weapons.

 

The Mexican attorney general, Sergio
Garcia Ramirez. has described the wealthy
mariuana-heroin rings as “extensive, com-
plex. and strong organizations." They are
clearly deadly dangerous as well.

The Mexican government reports that
315 soldiers were killed in a series of
military sweeps against narcotics opera-
tions nationwide in 1983-84.

in the latest bloodshed, trafﬁckers am-
bushed a police anti-drug squad last Friday
in a remote marijuana-growing area of
Vera Cruz state, 300 miles southeast of
Mexico City.

 

Shultz gave a downbeat ‘ of
his two-day visit and of a successful sum-
mit meeting between President Reagan and
Gorbachev in Geneva Nov. 19-20.

“Basically we have a lot to do," Shultz
told reporters at a news conference. in
respect to the summit meeting. he said that
“life doesn't end in the middle of
November.”

Shultz said he discussed Reagan’s latest
proposal to set limits on a number of
categories of nuclear arms with Gorbachev
and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Sheverd-
nadze but found “there was no narrowing
with respect to the nuclear and space
talks."

Dealers ambush police

Mexico City
(AP) The massacre of 22 policemen in
Mexico’s southern marijuana belt has

ican narcotics empires, gangs that feed the
demand of millions of American drug
users.

Escorts at their table in Library entrance
“People are becoming much more aware of the service. ”

Escort service tops previousrecord

By Andrea Cdnb’o’ti
STAFF WRITER

SUNYA’s escort service, “Don’t Walk
Alone." has escorted almost as many peo-
ple the past few weeks as in the past two
semesters combinedL recent ﬁgures show.

in Fall 1984 the service escorted 615 peo-
ple and in Spring 1985 that number fell to
481. But this semester, despite the non-
deiivery of an already purchased radio
system. about 900 people have taken ad-
vantage of the service, said Cheryl Oran-
soff, the program’s director.

“People are becoming much more
aware of the service," added Oransoff.

Oransoff said she feels that the number
of people using the service this semester is
“fantastic” and although she is hoping
that the number of students escorted will
rise to 2,000, she said Don‘t Walk Alone
will probably reach at least 1,500 students
by the end of the semester. “We’re only

operating about four more weeks until
classes end,” she stated.

The program has also experienced an
upswing in the number of volunteer
escorts, said Assistant to the Director
Maria Maglione. “This semester we have
150 volunteers and most of the people we
have are really dedicated and enthusiastic
about the program.”

“We're already starting to recruit peo-
ple for next semester,” she added.

Junior Dan Farley, who is a captain on
Monday nights said that he loves being an
escort. He also said this is his second year
with the program. “1 like getting to know
all my escorts. There's something special
about someone who would give up their
time to make someone else more comfor-
table." he said.

First year student Susan Karp said she
has used the servicew to walk from Indian
Quad to Colonial Quad because it was late

NOVIIE TYGAR UPS

and she didn’t want to walk across the
campus alone. She added. however, that
she does “feel relatively safe on this
campus."
“1 saw the advertisements and 1 figured
that 1’d give them a try," she said.
Despite Don't Walk Alone's successthis
. semester, the radio communications
system that was ordered for this service
still hasn’t arrived, according to Maglione.
“1 am a little annoyed at this," added
Oransoff, explaining that the system is
currently.in Glens Falls awaiting a crystal
part. “We ordered it'through the Educa-
tional Communications Center (ECC),"
she said, and because the part needed
wasn't in stock, it had to be ordered from
the manufacturer which primarily caused
the delay.
Maglione said Don’t Walk Alone is no
longer planning to use the system in this
semester. El

Senate debates
grade standard
for financial aid

Washington. DC.
COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE — College
students may have to maintain a “C”
average in the future in order to get
federal ﬁnancial aid.

The grade requirement is just one
change in the aid system Congress is
now debating as it tries to pass the
Higher Education Reauthorization Act
of 1985.

The grade measure. proposed by
senators Don Nickles (R-OK) and Clair-
bome Peli (D-Rl), has been proposed
unsuccessfully before. But chances for
its passage may be good this time.
sources said, because legislators are
looking for relatively painless ways to
cut the federal budget and because of re-
cent publicity about bad students who
get ﬁnancial aid.

Currently, students only must be in
god standing and make “satisfactory
academic progress” toward a degree to
receive federal aid.

“Unfortunately,” Nickles said during
a hearing earlier this month, “there
have been problems with theis open-
ended definition. He added that
“Because of this open-ended opportuni-
ty for abuse, I believe we need to have a
more speciﬁc standard."

Nickles originally advanced his ideas
after a 1981 audit found nearly 20 per-
cent of the students who got aid had less
than a “C” average. Ten percent had a
cumulative GPA under 1.5.

Congress also is debating a bill to let
graduate students, who generally face
higher education costs than
undergraduates. borrow more federally-
guaranteed loan money and pay it back
over a longer period of time.

The reauthorization process, which
effectively sets federal higher education
policies for the ensuing ﬁve years, usual-
ly triggers a slew of proposals that never
become law. But if federal loan pro-
grams are to be changed, the changes
will ﬁrst emerge during these congres-
sional review sessions.

The grading bill would put aid reci-
pients whose grades fall below 2.0 on
probation for a term. if the student
doesn't improve by the end of the pro—
bation period, he or she will be denied
federal aid.

Administrators would be empowered,
however, to extend the probation period
for hardship cases. such as extended
illness.

The new break for graduate students
who want a Guaranteed Student Loan
(GSL) program came up during a House
subcommittee hearing.

Georgetown University law school
dean John Kramer. speaking for a coali-
tion of law school associations, said
graduate students needed the break.
“Over time, middle class students in
particular are just not going to be able
to afford a graduate education."
Kramer said.

Moreover. unless debt repayment
policies are changed, many graduate
students will feel obligated to take high-
paying jobs after they get their degree.
instead of going into teaching or com-
munity service work. Kramer said.
Kramer‘s plan would let graduate
students borrow more than they current~
iy can, and, if they borrow more than
$15,000. repay it over 10 to 20 years.

in part because the plan calls for
graduate students to pay the interest on
the loans beginning with the 10th year
after graduation. Kramer said he
calculated that the changes will save the
government between $200 and $500
million a year.

Students would assume the cost, but
Kramer said he thinks they ultimately
should be making enough to keep the
payments from being too much of a

., burden.
