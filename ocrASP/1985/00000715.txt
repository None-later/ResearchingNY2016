Grave vigil deters vandals

Revisionist Zionist Alternative and Alpha Ep-
silon Pi volunteers who were guarding cemetaries
and synagogues Halloween night found themselves
defending a synagogue against egg-throwers.

“It went over pretty well. but there were a few in-
cidents on New Scotland Avenue. said Berloff. “A
house being used as a synagogue on New Scotland
Avenue was egged and the screens were pushed in.”

“We're not sure if anti-semitism was involved in
the incident. but none of the neighboring houses
were egged.” Berloff said. adding that Temple
lsrael. which is across the street was also eggd.
“Our guys chased them away from the temple.
though."

RZA will be attending two rallies in New York
City this Sunday. Berlof f added. “One will be at

Patrocinio P. Schweickart‘ will deliver the
keynote address at SUNYA’s second‘Presidential‘
Conference on Women. to be, held Saturday.
November 9. -
Beginning at 2 p.In.. Schweiclrart will speak on
the integration of women's "values" into science.
“Earlier the focus was on rights, on the right of
women‘ to be scientists and to have their contribui-
tions recognized." she explained. ‘S'But now we’re
looking at the values that are fostered by women’s
experience beyond the notion of victimization." she
said. _- _ ' ‘
According to Bonnie B. 'Spanier.- Director of
SUNYA’s Women's Studies Program and one of
the conference’s organizers. “The purpose of the
conference is to help demonstrate the connecti0n

science and technology affect the lives of women
and .orher excluded groups like minorities and the
working class." . .

-ittle sisters weaken’frats

(Intercollegiate Press Service) A resolution from

‘ the Fraternity Executives Association in Nashville.

Tennessee regarding “little sister" groups has been

distributed to all Vanderbilt University fratemity

and sorority presidents. The national organization

believes that the groups have a negative effect on
the Greek system. '

Sandy Stahl. associate directoryof sororities and
fraternities, supported the resolution because the
groups are “socially limiting -'and misleading." She
said she feels that there are rare instances in which
the function had a positive influence on the frater-
nity chapters.

The resolution stated that the little sister groups
“are not desirable adjuncts" to the college fraterni-
ty system and that they “inhibit the accomplish-
ment of chapter goals.” ‘

It further stated that the groups “divert resources
of time. effort. and money” and that they “weaken
the bonds of brotherhood" while serving to
“undermine the entire Greek system."

On education y educacién

Bilingual education was the topic of the Intema-
tional Tea held Sunday afternoon by the Interna~
tional Committee of the SUNY Women’s Group.
The group discussed the importance of beginning a
second language as early as the level of
kindergarten.

Rezaln Adams. Democratic Albany County com-
mitteewoman. also talked about the politics of the
upcoming Albany elections. Difficulties. that
students have had concerning increasing rents and
greedy landlords were touched upon in the
discussion. '

The International Committee meets every first
Sunday of each month to discuss issues faced by
minority groups.

While animals used for scien-
ﬁﬂsamsh noises eras: tiers

sensus of a variety of speakers at
SUNYA this weekend seemed'to
be that' research is neither im-‘
moral nor inappropriate. .

“We have to approach the mid-
dle ground. discussing the ethical
considerations of animal rights,”
said Gerald Tanneubaum. a
lawyer in the Veterinary Medicine
department at Tufts'University.

Tannenbaum was the first of
five lecturers speaking on 
welfare and Animal Research.
the first symposium the, Nor-
theastern Regional Meeting of the
Animal behavior Society. held at

SUNYA this past weekend. Each

speaker recognized the need to
protect animals while continuing
academic and scientiﬁc research.

.“The whole notion of animal
welfare is synonymous with
preventing unnecessary pain and
suffering." said Tannenbaum.
But. it is not necessarily true to

Awareness Day

of Crime Prevention. Both
events will be. held ipCC 375.
The ﬁnalsvsntrofuthe day
will be held at 7 pm. in Page
Hall on the downtown Draper
Campus. and will be [panel
discussion entitled f'Living and .
Moving Safely Off Campus."
According to Donahue. the
focus of the discussion will be
“basically on how to secure
dwellings off campus."
Donahue said the discussion.
“will be open to the communi-
ty" and will be held downtown
“to attract more of the off
campus community.".-' . I

The panel discussion will be 

moderated by Albany . Alder—
womau Nancy Burton and will
include members ‘of the Albany
Crime Prevention Unit. the'
SUNYA-Public Safety Depart-
ment. and the Albany Rape
Crisis Center. Also joining .the
event will be Maggie Boys.
Black Belt Judo Instructor and
Albany County Assistant
District Attorney Paul Der
Ohannesian. .

According to Donahue. the
Women’s Safety. Awareness
Day this fall "will deal with
more general topics and issues
of concern to women." 1.... the
upcoming event to be held
sometime next spring “will
quite possibly deal with a more
specific topic."

All students. especially

women. are encouraged to at-
tend. said Donahue. who add-
ed that she and others who
have worked on the event are
“very excited about the day."
All events are free of charge. D

that “pain isn’t an animals main
interest — survival is." “People”
see painless deaths as better than
forced pain. this is logical [from a
humane point of‘ view] but it is
wrong.” he said.

Randall Lockwood of the
Humane, Society of America said
he felt that changes in education
were the key to more humane
treatment of research animals.
“Students are taught that science
can stand aloof from ethical con-
siderations. . . ethics aren’t‘ in-
tegrated into life science educa-
tion.” he said. “Ethics courses in
veterinary schools are often

. electives. ' '

"There's a concept that hands
on experience with animals is the
best education," Lockwood said.
adding however. that is ethically

wrong to use aninmls repetitively
for experiments which always end
in m 'lar results.

“There are many alternatives."
Lbckwood said. noting that in

Britain "usinf live animals for

developing manual skills is 'fo‘r-
bidden. There. students work at
the side of a doctor in surgery.”

The nature of the education
system itself is a cause of in-
humane treatment of animals.
said Lockwood. "Students are
taught that animals are tools to be
used up,” he stated. adding
students “are taught to distance
themselves from animals.”

Students who are ethically oppos-
ed to some experiments are often
viewed as weak. sentimental. uns-
cientiﬁc. he said, adding that
“this either chases students from

I the ﬁe d or makes them callous to

suff g in am‘mals."

Susan Suarez, from SUNY
Oneonta. discussed the possibility
of using alternatives other than
animals as research subjects, but
dismissed most of the choices.

However. plants Will never be
an appropriate replacement,
Suarez said. because “behavior
relies on information process, and
plants lack a nervous sytem and
brain.” Constructing a computer
simulation. she said. “would re-
quire that we know everything
about an animal. and if we knew
that. there would be no need for
research.”

Suarez said she felt that
substituting a lower species
wouldn’t make sense because
“among existing species. there’s
no such thing as more or less
evolved."

Suarez asserted that “sciebtists
have a right to Expect any alter-
native to be as accurate as the cur-
rent one of animals. To do this,
they would have to be checked
against animal research and this
would require that they [animals]
beused.” Cl
