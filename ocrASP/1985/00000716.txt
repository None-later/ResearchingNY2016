school of Public Health Sciences at
SUNYA. according to the schools new
dean. DavidCarpenter.

The new school received approval from
the Governor’s office in June and by~
September 1986 over twenty classes will be

~ offered.

Two students are already enrolled in the
program. which will offer both masters
and doctoral degrees in Environmental
Health and Toxicology, and it is expected
that over thirty students will be enrolling
next semester.

Carpenter said he hopes the program
will expand with new courses in biology

statistics, epidemiology. social medicine_

and public health administration. He add-
ed that he had received over three hundred
requests for applications.

Whai makes the program unique. said
Carpenter, is that very few additional
resources were required to set it up. Most
of the faculty are, employed by the State
Department of Health and already have
their salaries paid by that department. said
Carpenter.

According to Carpenter, the faculty is
derived from the “enthusiastic and highly
qualified" staffs of the Department of
Health. The Albany Medical College, The
‘Veterans Administration Medical Center

umbia University as the only school in“ the
state that offers graduate studies in public

health science. he added. ,

The new school will serve'th‘e interests of"
both SUNYA and the Department 'of
Health. said Carpenter. The school will
benefit from the program because it will
attract more students and the Department
of Health will benefit by‘training a pool of

potential scientists and lab technicians.'~
Carpenter stressed that participants in

the program will gain real experience by

researching at the Department of Health

and added that there is  abundance of

jobs in the field. _

DThe new school has been discussed for
years but it wasn't until Carpenter arrived
in Albany in 1980. That discussion turned
to action. he said. Carpenter. with the
assistance of Warren llchman.’ Provost of
the Rockefeller College " of Public and
Policy. organized the school and presented
it to the Governor for approval.

Carpenter, who is the first dean of the
new school, spent five and a half years as
Director of Laboratories for the Depart-
ment of Health. Before coming to Albany
he worked for the federal government and
has done much of his personal research in
the field of neurosiology.

“Your vote counts” was incumbent
District Attorney Sol Greenberg's
message to the students Sunday at
“Meet the Candidates Night,” which
was held in the Campus Center,
Ballroom.

That message was echoed by many of
the other 24 local candidates running in
Tuesday's election who appeared at the
event.

According to Stephanie Kay. vice-
chair of Student Action Committee.
almost all of t candidatesalso touched
on the importance of increased student-
community interaction.

Student Action Committee Chair
Larry Hartman opened the program by
reminding the audience that thisis the
second year in a row the University’s
students have led the nation in register-
ing to vote. He then turned the
microphone over to Kay who introduced
the candidates. each of whom spoke to
the students for approximately two
minutes.

Meet the Candidates Night packs
in politicians but only 70 students

a one to one basis. Kay said that she was
a little disappointed in student turnout
and hoped that it wouldn’t beH a
foreshadowing of voter turnout at the
polls On Tuesday.

She did. however. say she was very
pleased with the” number of candidates
who attended. “It showed that they felt
it was important enough to come up
here to speak to students," she said.

“Students are not
second-class citizens.
They can make a
big difference. ”

—— Richard Barrett

 

Democratic incumbent Mayor
Thomas Whalen told the sinall audience
of about 70 that “the Democrats in
Albany have established a reputation to
be proud of. certainly one that students
can be proud of."

Whalen pointed out that he has work-
ed together with University President
Vincent O’Leary to lobby for additional
student housing and adds that he wants
“a symbolic relationship between
government and universities."

Whalen's opponent. Lewis Russo. did

not attend the event.
' Nick Collucio, a Democrat running
for re-clcction to the board of uldcrs
from the lSth ward said. “We are look-
ing for better housing for students and
we can do this by working together."

As much as 50 percent of thc lSIh
ward is composed of SUNYA students.
because the uptown campus is part of
the ward.

Collucio's opponent. Republican
Richard Barrett. told the audience.
“students are not second class citizens.
They can make a big difference."

The speeches Were followed by a wine.
and cheese reception in which students

 

were free to talk with the candidates on

Hartman also expressed disappoint-
ment with student turnout, but said that
he feels those students who did attend
did not waste their time. .

Kiel Atlas. a 1984 SUNYA graduate‘
said. “It was a good idea as a whole. It
gives the people a chance to meet the
candidates of they don’t have the time
to watch the news. Bringing the can-
didates up to the campus. is a great
idea." '

Tommy Szczesniak said he attended
because he was curious. “if you are go- ~
ing to run it is based on appearance. per-
sonality. and how interested you seem.
Some speakers didn't feel that it was im-
portant to be here and the way they
spoke reﬂected this.”

“it was rcmurk blc that all these can-
didates came to UNY." stated Mark
Rivers. a central council member who
added. “It shows that they have a ge-
nuine interest i the school."

Belt Ginzburg, Program Director for
SA. said “it was an extremely well-run
event, the only problem being the ex-
treme evidence of student apathy. It was
wonderful to see all the candidates take
time out of thelr campaigning schedule
to come to SUNY." El

 

 

 

 

 

 

companies in their annual service
contract renewal. , .

Four different contractors.
entered bids for the servicing and
maintenanceof the elevators on
the quads. “Irwin elevators had
the lowest bid and therefore
received the annual contract."
said Plant Su perintendent‘Donald
von Linden. Irwin replaces Otis
elevators. which had previously
held the contract.

“The contract." said von
Linden. “includes emergency
repairs, maintenance. and
cosmetic pkeep - which means the
replacing of floor tiles and

general appearance of the
elevators.” ’
Although Irwin has been .

awarded the contract, not all the

was expecting a higher turnout."

said Hartman. explaining that last

year’s eléction attracted “85 per-
' cent of the student voters on

campus.” .

According to Hartman, 4.200
'student were registeredto vote in
the elction. “This summer we put
address labels on after we got the
addresses from t 6 Office ‘of
Residential Life.” said Hartman.
adding that only about 10 percent
Of those registered to vote on
campus actually voted.

“Those who got out to vote
were enthusiastis and they wanted
to make their vote count.” he
said. adding a lot of those from
Colonial and Dutch weren’t
voting for the first time.

The polls were open from 6
a.m. to 9 p.m. Students on State
Quad voted in the quad flagroom.
Students on Indian Quad and

_ parts of Dutch Quad voted at the
gym. while the rest of Dutch
Quad and all of Colonial Quad
voted at the Thruway House on
Washington Avenue. SA used
avan to shuttle students to and

, from their pollingplace.

“if the university were closed
on Election Day. there would be

no nore_ voting, said Hartman, v

adding “we concentrated our ef-
fort for the evening when students
are out of class." , ‘ ‘ ‘

“Surprisingly.' off-campus
studentsl spoke to-tended to

vote. at least in higher percen- .

tges." he noted. "‘1 guess it’s

because there’s more “of a feeling :

of being e resident of Albany even
th0ugh it is a little more
inconvenient." I ' '

Don Smirti.‘ a junior at
S"NYA who lives on lndian
Quad said he voted out of civic
duty. and said he feels that “peo-
ple who don't vote are slime. it
doesn’t matter whereyou vote. as
long as you vote and vote for
somebody. There's no excuse for
not voting." he said.

“1 voted in thevgym and it
wasn't overcrowded." be con-
tinued. “l was able to walk right
through and vote without
waiting. The gym was a good
'place for lndian to'voie.“ he said.

oldest quad on campus, has the .
original elevators that were in-- \

stalled in 1964.
He stated, “ln the future we
plan some 'anticipated im—

.provements. We have just con-

eluded a survey of all the
elevators on, campus and we will
determine what renovations are
needed.” He said, ,“I feel the
elevators are in good condition
and are working at their best.”
Von Linden noted that van-
dalism accounts for much of the
repair work undertaken each
year. He said. “there is a certain
amount of vandalism and thatls
why we are considering these im-
provements. I feel the students
would treat the elevators better if
they were in better condition."

— Donald von Linden

 

“An extremely rough estimate

of how much repair is disc to van-
dalism would be in the
neighborhood of 50 percent. he
said. _

The figure‘only pertains to the
elevators in the dorms, however.
::The actual damage ranges from
kicked in panels to burned but-
tons.” said .von Linden. “We
would like to reduce this figure
and this year has shown a noticed
decline even though it is relatively
early in the school year. It is‘a
welcomed improvement."

Students generally do not seem
satisfied with the elevators and
their maintenance. Robin Cohen,
a first year student who lives on
the 10th floor of Dutch Tower
stated “I don’t even use the
elevators in the morning because I
don’t have time to wait. I don’t
think three elevators are sufficient
to begin with and when one
breaks down. it makes the pro-
blem even worse."

Steve Mesulam. another resi-
dent of Dutch Quad said. “The
elevators are definitely not work-

working better than they are now.
It is so aggravating. i use them all
the time and I sometimes have to
wait for 15 minutes.”

When asked if she thought
renovations might decrease van-
dalism, she said. “it might, but
you can’t be sure. Some students
would abuse the elevators no mat-
ter what they looked like."

When an elevator breaks down.
the power plant is notified. which
in turn contacts lrwin Elevators.
A repairman is dispatched who
reports back on arrival and

Vcomplation. ”

Von Linden said, “So far this
service has been fine. but i will be
keeping a close watch to deter-
mine whether the work is satisfac-
