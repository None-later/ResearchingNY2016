COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE —— Student
groups at two schools are moving to im-
pose tighter restrictions on their ’campus
papers, largely in response to normal
operating procedures. 1

While student papers in the past have
lurched into trouble on many campuses for
publishing deliberately-provocative
material, newspapers at Notre Dame and
North Carolina-Chapel Hill recently have
attracted controversy while following nor-
mal operating procedures.

Student politicians at Notre Dame got
angry when The Observer raised its adver-
tising rates, and some UNC students were
enraged when The Daily Tar Heel printed,
amid other quotes, Friedrich Nietische‘s
assertion that “God is dead."

At UNC, dissidents sought to strip the

paper of student fee funding: “lt‘gave me

somewhat of a jolt that someone would cut
off the student voice,” recalled Arne
Rickert, The Tar Heel‘s co-editor.

Rickert .said‘ the student religious
group’s attempt to end mandatory student
fee funding for the paper is “ironic. They
would cut off the paper that has covered
them."

Notre Dame student President Bill Hea-
ly said he only wants The Observer to open
its books to the public.

“We think the booksshould be open,"
Healy said. “We spend about $100,000.0f
the students' money on The Observer. It’s
only fair.” g

The Observer irritated student govern-
ment leaders when it raised its ad rates
earlier this fall. The student government

spends about $10,000 a year in advertising

“I don't want them to determine editorial

She added, “we are already accountable '

Nevertheless. about 80 percent of the
students surveyed by the student govern-
ment think the paper ‘should open its

six of seven did not get any student funds.

purchase new vending machines becuase

Tickets are only available in the Alumni
Quad cafeterias during dinner time and
from machines which have been known to
break down often, Seymourian said. _

Lambda Peers offer help. by listening

in matters Concerning homosexuality

By Ellen,Schwartz 5 “

On this-campus, there must be at least 1500
students who are gay or lesbian. if you know ten
people the chances are you know someone who's
gay. Maybe you're wondering about gay men and
lesbians in general.

Where can you go to find out about gay men and
women at SUNYA? There’s the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance, but perhaps the thought

Beyond

of going to a GALA meeting
alone is terrifying. If it is, 
SUNYA has a service that might a
be of interest to you. ' '
The Lambda Peers are a group Malonty
of people, sponsored by the Gay and Lbian
Alliance, who are available to talk to you on an in-
dividual basis about gay and lesbian issues. If
you’re looking for somebody to talk to about being
gay-whether you are or not-but you aren’t sure you
want to discuss it with your friends. a Lambda Peer
might be able to help. Everything you talk about

with a Lambda Peer will be kept completely con-‘1 "

ﬁdential. Your mime will .never be revealed -to
anyone-not even another Peer(only your Lambda
Peer will know it). -

~ Before a person becomes a Lambda Peer, he or

she goes through a training program. This twelve

hour course is coordinated by Middle Earth staff
members. Anyone who want to become a Lambda
Peer must attend every training session and
demonstrate that she or ‘he has acquired the
necessary skills to be of help to callers.

The emphasis of the training program is on the
listening skills. Lambda Peers learn to keep their
mouths shut and listen to what you have to say
without cutting you off in mid-sentence.

Unlike the people at Middle Earth, Lambda
Peers will not counsel you. They will meet with you
someplace where you feel comfortable and they will
try to help you identify your concerns. Once you've
ﬁgured out what the problem is a Lambda Peer will
not tell you what to do. She or he will help yu ex~
amine your options objectively.

if there are resources in the community that
could be of use to you, a Lambda Peer can point
you in the right direction. Peers are familiar with

the services and activities of the gay. and lesbian .
community and will refer you to any that would be
beneﬁcial to you

if you’d like to talk to a Lambda Peer, call Mid-
dle Earth at 442-5777. Tell the person who answers
that you’d like to be referred to Lambda Peers.
You’ll be asked to leave your name (you don’t have
to give your last name if you don’t want to) and a
phone number where you can be reached and a Peer
will contact yOu. Don’t worry, nobody will call

If you aren’t available when a Peer calls you, she
or ,he' won’t tell your roomates why she or he is call- '
ing. She or he will call back anothertime and the of
two you can set up an appointment. When you call
Middle Earth you can request either a male or femal
Peer, if you have a preference. Every effort will be
made to accommodate your request.
