Reports  increased support for

 

black colleges found misleading

A I V Washington, D.C.
COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE —— The‘ U.S.
Dept. of Education’s recent report that
;thc administration has increased its sup-
port of black-colleges, signiﬁcantly is
misleading, according to black college
leaders. ', _ ,-

In late August. the department an-
nounced the federal government gave the
nation's predonimantly-black polleges
some $620.6 million in 1984, an increase of

$14 million over I983 and $75.8 million

since 198i. -. ;.. ~

But the increas'csc blaCk education
leaders said. don't make up for broad cuts
in other areas like student aid, and haven’t
stopped black colleges' recent ﬁscal crises
from worsening.

“Kids have been losing slot of grants.
We have heard a lot of horror stories. on
the other hand, the schools are getting
.more money, but that mostly helps the
profs and graduate student's," said James
Borders, editOr of the Black Collegian.

“If you look atthc (proposals for) pro-
grams that benefit minorities in his

(Reagan) original budget for 1985. you can _

see he is not a strong supporter of black

colleges,” said Mike Reed, an aide to Rep.

William Gray (D-Pa.); ' .,
In that budget, Reagan proposed

abolishing Graduate Professional Oppor- ,

tunity Grants' aimed to help minority
students, Reed said.
The administration aLSO wanted to

"Keg .ban‘ proposed

Thursday.

“I don’t think this is a feasible policy
at all,” said Abelow. “We believe-that
bulk containers should be allowed,"

said Abclow..~ adding that “Student,

Association feels the policy isa violation
of the rights ‘of'students who arc’2l
years of age or older and living on
campus."
\ Phil Botwlnick, who also served on
the “Implementation of 2! " Committee
said that “as long as the alcohol bulk
containers are legally purchased, the
University should have no say in who is
involved in the consumption of it."
“The administration should keep in
mind the difference between the 21 pur-
chase age and the consumption age.

This is an important factor in any deci- '

sion they make about the bulk container
policy," said Botwlnick.

“The University should not extend
their policy beyond the limits of the
law," he added. ‘

“While this may seem like a step
towards a dry campus. we will never
have a dry campus," said Steve Oawley,
SA President. “That's an
impossibility."

“We have to be serious about this."
said Pogue. “We have a law that the
governor has signed into action; a law
which states that persons under the age

halve the TRIO program, which grants
money to “disadvantaged” students. Con:
gress, howevcrﬁulti’rnately increased TRIO
funding. - . ' ‘
.The administration's $14 million black:

college increase “is really symbolic," said"

Arnold Mitchcrn of the National Council»
of Educational Opportunity Associations;~
“You really cannot be helping out black
collegesl'whcn you cut aid by such a
degree.”

The notion the administration has cut
funding of black colleges is not true, said
Sharon Mcssinger of the Education Dept.
She said various increases in federal stu-
dent aid programs also have helped black
students and, by extension, the black
students who attend predominantly-black
colleges. ' ' '- ‘ * ' ~

Approximately 85 percent of the
students at black colleges — of which there
are about 112 —' have received some type
of aid, Mitchem said.

Of the, additional black college funds,
moreover, about _, 25 percent went to
Howard University in Washington D.C.,
explained Joyce Payne. director of the Of-
fice for the Advancement of Public Black
Colleges. 7

The picture for black schools looks dim.
Fewer than half the 264 black colleges
open in 1974' are still around today, said
Craig Shelton, president of the National
Organization of Black University and Col-
legc Students. 1 E!

of 2! are not to be sold. given or to par-
ticipate in any wriy'ithhe‘ consumption
of alcohol.”

“According to the way the Residence
license is written," said Gawley, “it is
withinthc rights of the university to for-
mulate a policy such as this." ‘

“No student is being denied the right
to have alcohol in their suits or rooms,"
stated Pogue. “We’re simply trying to
remove the temptation to
overconsume." , . V

“A ban on bulk containers is clearly
an infringement of students rights,"
said Botwinick. “A student’s room on
campus is his or her home, and an in-
dividual shouldn't have his private life
regulated if it is not disruptive to those
around him," he added.

“In this case, the relatiOnship bet-
ween the university and students is a
landlord-tenant relationship," said
Gawley. “We are certainly fighting to
keep bulk containers," he said.

- “Approved parties in approved areas

[will continue,” said Pogue. “We're

simply trying‘ to keep a limit 0 the
amount of alcohol consumed in rooms
and suited,” he added.

Nancy Perrotta, a 21-year-old Indian
Quad resident, said she is opposed to the
prposcd ban. “-I don't feel that the
University is an entity in itself that can
impose such regulations," she said.
