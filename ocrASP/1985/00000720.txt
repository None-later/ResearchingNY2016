COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE —- The

Education Department's‘atten'ipts'
to reduce the number of mistakes

in Guaranteed Student Loan
(GSL) awards aren't making

much headway, authors of ‘ a I

recently released federal audit
say. ,‘ v-
General Accounting Ofﬁce

(GAO) auditors said the error rate r

in the GSL programsis‘ probably

about as high today as during the '

1982-83 school year, 'when' about
13 percent of GSL funds went to
students who didn’t qualify for as
much loan money as they
received. ' ‘

‘At the time, » the ' shocked
Reagan Administration vowed to
stop giving out too much money
in the program, installing an
elaborate new checking pro-
cedure. But the new procedure
an't working, the GAO said in its
report. -

The GAO found the procedure
had saved about $22 million, but
has cost about $23 million.

The process of checking for er-
rors, moreover, has itself delayed
making awards to about a third of
the students receiving GSL loans,
the auditors said. The delays, in
turn, forced thousands of
students to borrow funds from
other sources, or reduce class
loads, the auditors added.

Some congressmen said the
stubbornly high error rate—and
increasing concern over what is
widely viewed as the high rate at
which college graduates default
on their federally-guaranteed
loans--make it hard to push bills
’to raise loan limits through

    

Congress.  '
.,In, their report, dated

September 27, the GAO; auditors
' said the government could cut the
error rate faster by training cam- _

pus ﬁnancial aid'officers better.

"In I response lo the .study,
Education Department ofﬁcials
said they already have been im-

plementing many of the GAO's
"suggestions. ‘
The GAO auditors said' the-

department still hasn't done
enough. ~

The audit was performed at the
request of Sen. Paul Simon (D-
lllinois), who asked the GAO to
study the department’s efforts to
validate the accuracy}l of GSL
awards made by collegehofﬁcials.

Education department officials
were at the time reviewing about
two-thirdS'of all GSL..wards. "

They found that,-during the
198283 year, ab'outﬁl percent of
all GSL awards were correct by $2
or more, 40 percent were off by at
least $100.

The 61 percent error rate is a
decline from 71 percent in
1980-81, but, according to one
department' official, is still
“Substantial.”

All told, students improperly
were receiving about $319 million
in loans, about 13 percentcf the
total loan funds available.

“It is amazing to me we have a
$300 million-plus error when we
are sitting around trying to ﬁgure
out where we are going to get
more money for the program,”
Rep. Thomas Coleman (R-
Missouri) said in June when the

Foreign student enrollment in U. 8. falls
dUe to climb in value of American dollar

New York, N. Y.

COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE — A dramatic decline
in the number of 1ranian students and the high
value of the American dollar slowed the increase
in foreign student enrollment on U.S. campuses
last year, a new census by the Institute for Inter-
national Education (IIE) said.

“It'stbasically money. With the value of the

" dollar, the U.S. is about as expensive as

anywhere,” said John Reichard of the National
Association of Foreign Student Affairs in
Whashington, D.C. “In view of the cost, it’s
amazing there has not been a drop."

Some state schools — such as the Texas
system, long a leader in recruiting foreign
students — have raised their out of state tuition
rate, making them less attractive to foreign
students.

Nevertheless, 342,113 foreign students enrolled
in American colleges in 1984-85, less than a one
percent increase from the previous year, the 1113’s
Mary L. Taylor said. .

During the foreign student boom of the seven-
ties, annual increases reached 10 percent a year.

More than 50,000 students from Iran were stu-
dying in the United States during 1980.

As of 1984-85, only 16,640 Iranians were
enrolled U.S. colleges, the institute found.

While the oil glut has slowed the ﬂow of
foreign students from other OPEC countries,
too, the HE found‘a continuing increase of
students from South and East Asia.

to the United States. There were 22,590
Taiwanese in U.S. schools last year, slightly more
than the number of students from Malaysia.

Data show Asian students, who traditionally
have .made up the largest portion of foreign
students in the United States, have replaced Mid-
dle Eastern students as the fastest growing group
as-well.

“The continued growth of Paciﬁc Rim
students is due to the strong economy there, and-
thcre is a lot of government support in those
countries for sending students abroad,"
Reichard explained.

Foreign students tended to take engineering
programs most often, followed by business and
management, mathematics, computer sciences,
and physical and life sciences, the institute said.

Many of them, moreover, are graduate
students. In fact, one of every three students at-
tending U.S. grad schools is foreign-born,
Reichard noted. Grad schools have become so
dependent on foreign student they can't afford to
give up their aggressive recruiting efforts
overseas. he added.

Some American universities are even planning
to set up foreign extension branches to help them
woo students abroad. But those efforts couldn't
overcome the economic factors slowing the rate
of foreign student enrollment here.

Reichard speculated about 80,000 to 85,000
foreign students are studying in colleges in the
Soviet Union, less than a fourth the number in
the U.S.
