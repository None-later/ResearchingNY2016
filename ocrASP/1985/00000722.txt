Garr shines as raqUetballi-dropstwo

The Albany men's and
women’s racquetball club
premiered Sunday at RPI in their
ﬁrst competition with the Eastern
Collegiate Racquetball Associa-
tion. The men’s team lost in
singles and doubles teams com-
petition while the women’s team
was victorious in both, but it
wasn't enough to carry the team
to a combined victory.

For the Danes this is their ﬁrst
year in the Eastern Collegiate Ra—
quetball Association. The other
members include Binghamton,
West Point, RPI, Providence
College and North Eastern.

Last year they were ofﬁcially
recognized by SA, but didn’t
receive funding as they do this
year. To become a member of the
Eastern Collegiate Raquetball
Association they had to play the
teams in five matches last year,
which was considered a trial year.

Garr Thompson, who founded
the club two years ago was the top
seeded player in the inter-
collegiate nationals last year. He
was the sole Albany winner as he
defeated Odell of RP], 15-12,
15-15.

The other seven Albany singles
players were defeated by RPl's
strong men's squad. They were
Brian Tollin, Chris Hlavatovic,
John Sayour. Marc Reich. Matt
Blank. Jeff Millman, and Gregg
Osinoff.

ln women's singles competition
Albany was victorious in four out
of five matches. Team members
Francine Fudin. Lori Marwald.
Janeen Lima and Carol Collins

raked up wins for Albany. Jen-
nifer Manner was defeated in her
match.

The doubles team of Fudin-
Collins and Marwald-Lima chalk-
ed up points for Albany as well.

“The girl's did most of the win-
ning for us," Club President
John Sayour said, “they all turn—
ed in great performances.”

The men’s first doubles team of
Thompson and Tollin was vic-
torious. With the Danes behind
8-9 the Hlavatovic-Reich second
doubles team won the last match
of the night 15-14, 8-15, 11-10 in a
tie braker to put the two teams at
nine wins apiece. .

RPI won the overall match.
which combined the men's and
women‘s scores, 494-453. “Con-
sidering.it was our first league
competition and that we are such
a young team. I'm very happy
with the results,” said Sayour.

The Danes then lost to
Binghamton on Sunday, 12-6.

“They were a lot stronger than
we expected", said Reich.

The Binghamton team
outplayed the Albany team. In
men’s singles competition,
Albany lost seven out of eight
matches. Thompson was the sole
winner.

“The match was a lot closer
than the score reﬂected." Sayour
added.”There were lots of one
point matches."

This was detrimental for
Albany as they lost three matches
in 11-10 tiebreakers. if Albany
had won the three ticbreakers.
they would have tied
Binghamton.

In doubles competition, the
ﬁrst doubles team of Tollin and
Thompson was victorious. The
second and third doubles teams
lost. ' '

In women‘s singles competi-
tion, Fudin. Marwald, and Col-

lins scored-points for Albany.
Manner lost her match. Because.
Albany only brought four
players. they were forced to
forfeit the other match.

The second doubles team of
Marwald and Manner was

day, continues to be a nemesis for
opposing receivers.

Denis Murphy. the emotional
star defensive lineman who has
been magniﬁcent in pressuring
quarterbacks. will be taking aim
this week on Bulls’ starting
quarterback. John Gentidella, a
freshman who replaced. injured
John Mings in the seasonfs se-
cond game. Mings could see some
action in Saturday's game, accor~
ding to Dando.

“He (Gentidella) has been up
and down." said Dando. “Last
game against Rochester he threw
as good as (Marty) Barrett and
(Ken) Hyer. But then there‘s been
games where he has thrown terri-
ble. He‘s got a great arm, but he
makes freshman mistakes."

Running back Dane Hightower
leads the squad in receptions with
receiver Dan Winters a close se-
cond. “We haven’t moved the
ball as well as in other years."
Dando said of his 4-4 team. "I

can't explain it. We haven’t hit all Y.

cylinders yet.”

One explanation Dando offers
is the injuries that have beset his
team. Eight starters, mostly on
offense, have gone down since
opening day.

To shut down ‘Dando's Air-

force’, Ford says that consistent
pressure must be applied to Gen-
tidella. Ford plans on “mixing it
up.” sending aidifferent amount
of rushers on each play.

For Buffalo defensively,

Dando‘s main concern is shutting
down the wishbone and forcing
Milano to pass. “It‘s always
tough to defend the wishbone.”
said Dando. “It’s our ﬁrst oppor-
tunity to see the damn thing.”
Dando feels if his Bulls can get

According to Albany State
head coach Bob Ford, the call was
not as risky as it looked.

“They were giving us a nine-
man front, and I felt we could
throw on'them.”said Ford.

The strategy was wasted,
however, when Russell fumbled
on the next play from scrimmage.
So Anderson returned the favor

“Albany is tough when they’re

Survival“Garner a different type of adventure

By Marc Pasaltlmer

It was a cold. blustery morning ’

as I stepped out of the car. I had
arrived at my destination of Pitt-
sﬁeld. Mass. to take part in a new
kind of adventure. Today was the
day l was to try my luck at the
survival game.

R e c e i v i n g
ammunition. a
gun, and a pair
of goggles was
my ﬁrst order
of business. ‘
After getting outfitted. I was ask-
ed to sign a waiver declaring the
organizers of this event unac-
countable for any injury incurred
during the game. What was I get-
ting myself into? ‘

It was now time to head out to
the firing range to learn how to
shoot my paint-hurling pistol.
The guide showed me the proper
way to shoot the gun and how to
load and unload the paint cap-
sules which served as ammuni~
tion. These paint-ﬁlled capsules
would explode on impact. leaving
a mark wherever they landed.

My gun was now loaded and it
was time to test it out to ensure
that it was functioning properly.
It was also time to see if I could
shoot with at least a slight bit of
accuracy. My first two practice
shots were rather wild, but my
third one found its target. I was
beginning to feel ready for battle.

Three teams would be com-
petingvtoday. The team I was on
would be in the first game of the
day. A feeling of nervous excite-
ment entered my body as game
time drew closer.

After the judges explained the
rules of the game to all the teams.
it was time to get down to
business. The judges led us and
the other team out to the playing
area. which consisted primarily of
a leaﬂess forest situated along a
hillside. The team I belonged to
was told to defend at the bottom
of the hill, while the opposing
team was instructed to start at the
top of the hill.

As I walked with my comrades
to our home base. I couldn't help
but wonder what I might en-
counter. Would I kill or be killed?
How would it feel to squeeze the

Freeman. and it only took Squeri
16 seconds to bring Hofstra to
within two points of a tie.

Squeri hit Palermo for 26 yards
and then found Moore for the re-
maining seven to bring the score
to 29~27.

That’s when Soldinl appeared
to close the door with his 51-yard
sprint.

“It was a basic veer, our bread
and butter.” said Soldini.“l was
just trying for the first down. but
I got a huge hole, and they-were
stacked at the line to prevent the
first down. so there wasn't
anyone in the secondary to stop
me."

But the door opened up again
when Squeri engineered the
62-yard drive that put the Dut-
chmen on Albany's three-yard
line. before Anderson started his
one-man show.

His interception brought the
ball out to the 20. but Albany was
forced to punt from their own 29.
or so thought the Dutchmen.

The snap went short to Ander-
son. who found Mike Rieger for
16 yards and a first down. giving

trigger and gun down my enemy?
The answers lay only a few
minutes away.

We arrived at our home base
where I surveyed the terrain that
would hold my fate. It being late
fall. most of the trees were devoid
of the foliage so that the area was
comprised of a gray forest with a
brown floor of dry leaves.
Numerous twigs. branches, and
tree stumps also made up the
woody landscape. -

The team I was playing for w
divided into three units. Two of
the units would try to capture the
opponent’s flag, while the third
would stay back and defend our
own flag. For the ﬁrst game. I
would be on the offensive.

I, along with several of my
teammates. moved up the left
flank. Keeping our heads down
while manuevering through the
underbrush, we took our posi-
tions midway up the hill. It wasn’t
a minute before I heard the pop
of a gun go off. An opposing
player was about 15 feet ahead of
us. We exchanged shots and
within a few minutes we ‘had
disposed of him. A fine-placed
shot by one of my teammates had

done away with the enemy.

After this slight altercation. my
colleagues moved onward
towards the opposition‘s flag
while I maintained my position. It
was not long before my adver-
saries made themselves known.
There were two of them.

I sat in a ditch behind a tree ex-
changing fire with my opponents.
I was about to let off another shot
when I discovered my gun was
empty. No problem. I thought. as
1 reached into my pocket to
reload with another round of
ammunition.

There was a problem. however,
for with all my running around, I
must have lost my ammunition.
Here I was. a sitting duck for my
opposition. but I couldn't let on
that I was devoid of firepower.

I held my ground and bluffed
my opponents into’thinking my
gun was still loaded. even though
I was just shooting an empty gun.
I did this for about five minutes,
but I knew my luck wouldn‘t hold
out forever.

I decided to retreat back about
ten feet where I noticed a team-
mate was just to the right of me. I
told him I was out of ammo and

suggested a retreat back to our
home base. The enemy was ad-
vancing and we made a run for it.
I pulled out first and my team-
mate followed.

We ran helter-skelter through
the forest. trying hard to avoid
the many trees and branches in
our path. The retreat was a suc-
cess and we soon learned that we
had captured their flag.

For our second game. I was to
play defense. I wanted to stay
close to our flag without making
my presence known, so I asked
my teammate to cover me with
leaves from head to toe. I soon
became part of the natural
landscape.

While lying under all those
leaves, I could hear ﬁghting going
on in the distance. This lasted for
around ten minutes. then silence
prevailed. The silence was soon
broken when I heard someone
coming up the hill. It was one of
my teammates and he had the op-
ponent’s flag. Game two was
ours. and high-ﬁves were ex-
changed between all the team
members.

Our third game had us defen-
ding the hilltop once again. 1 was

on offense. and immediately I set
off down the left side with a
fellow teammate.

We moved down quickly, and
we were soon confronted by ﬁve
enemy players. I was situated
behind two narrow trees which
provided me with little cover. A
shot was ﬁred at me and missed
my head by just a few inches.

It was now my turn to let off a
shot. I saw an opposing player
standing up about 25 feet away
and I let one go. The paint ﬁlled
capsule sailed through the air and
found its mark. I had killed an
enemy player. I retreated back to
my home base and within ten
minutes. their flag was in our
hands. We had won all three of
our games.

After our ﬁnal victory, it was
time to reflect on the adventures
we encountered during the day.
Stories of each person’s ex-
periences weré exchanged with
one another as the day drew to a
close.

I walked back to the car with a
feeling of great satisfaction for it
had been quite an experience. My
day of adventure was over. I had
survived. D
