That WasThen: It’s here; it’s now

udging a movie based on a novel

generally creates problems. Films

should be considered on their own
merits because films and novels are dif-
ferent beasts. Reality (and the public) dic-
tates otherwise. Therefore, screenwriters
and directors generally tailor a story to
meet their own needs.

Ian Spelling

Director ,Christopher Cain and screen-
writer Emilio Estevez clearly felt changes
were a necessity to bring S.E.Hinton’s
novel That Was Then This Is Now to the
screen. in addition to disassociating That
Was Then from the novel, Cain and
Estevez sought to transcend the overall box
office enigma of the other Hinton transla-
tions to film. Tex, The Outsiders, and
Rumble Fish all faired poorly. The stone
cast in this attempt to kill two birds is a
sense of hopefulness lacking in the novel '
and the other novel-based pictures.

Based solely on its own merits. That Was
Then works surprisingly well. As com-
pared to the other Hinton adaptations,
That Was Then often works better; which
in truth rates as qualified praise. The other
films weren't all that good. Estevez up-
dated the story, which now takes place in
Minneapolis/St. Paul in the i980's. This
makes the story far more accessible than
The Outsiders or Rumble Fish.

Estevez plays Mark. a troubled and
troublesome young man who bucks the
system at every opportunity. He drives
recklessly, treats people nastily, and simply
refuses to mature. Mark's best friend,
Bryan (Craig Sheffer), with whom he has
lived since his parents' deaths nine years
earlier. begins to grow up and prepares to
live in the real world. Mark quickly
becomes jealous of both Bryan and his new
girlfriend. Cathy (Kim Delaney). and goes

 

 

 

completely out of control.

e romance between Bryan and Cathy,
which is superbly developed through
short, concise scenes and a superior mon-
tage sequence, generates tension
throughout. Bryan’s former girlfriend seeks
revenge. He, however, backs down from
any confrontation. Mark then involves
himself and suffers minor injuries as a
result. Later, Mark and Bryan hustle two
older men at their friend Charley’s bar.
Outside the two gunwielding men con-
front Mark and Bryan. Charley dies at-
tempting to protect the boys. Mark turns
inward following the incident, while Bryan
relies on Cathy. Thus. the drift between
them widens. The film's remainder ex-
amines the manner in which the two
young men face impending and colliding
realities.

Estevez performs gamely in what must
be described as the most underdeveloped
of the three major roles. Whether this
derives from his acting or writing, or any
combination, can’t be ascertained.
However, Mark doesn't seem real enough
to consider memorable. Sheffer, in his
screen debut, brings a sense of growth to
his role. Bryan genuinely blossoms
throughout the story. Unfortunately, Shef‘
fer occasionally loses sight of the
character's personality, or at least its cur-
rent state of mental development, and
veers off in different directions at inoppor-
lune moments. Kim Delaney offers a
sweet, sympathetic performance in her
debut, though the role, for dramatic pur-
poses, is severly underwritten. And
Morgan Freeman's humane portrayal of
Charlie certainly ranks as the best perfor-
mance in the film.

Director Cain relies far too heavily on
close-ups for dramatic emphasis. . One

 

 

 

could count the freckles on Estevez’ face.
Also. That Was Then feels dangerously
close to Francis Coppola’s The Outsiders,
which oozed darkness and despair in its
cinematography. Cain's continued at-
tempts to visually complement Estevez’
script often over-emphasize rather than

add meaning. The rock soundtrack. on the '

other hand, superbly weaved itself into the

Miller said that banning bulk con-

potentially “drive drinking
underground.’ ’

“Miller also expressed concern

Advertising saturatedwith sexism

By Ken Dornbaum
EDImRIAL ASSISTANT '

“Ads sell products. but they also sell
concepts of value. love. sexuality. and nor-
malcy. and say who we are and who we
should be.” said Dr. Jean Kilbournc.
speaking in front of over 350 women and
men in the Campus Center Ballroom Mon-
day night.

Kilbourne. who examined sexism in
advertising. is a nationally known media
analyst.

“i want people to take advertising
seriously, to understand the cumulative ef-
fects of advertising on society and its view
of women." she said. adding that some
people feel it is only a trivial issue.

However. she continued. “Advertising
is the most powerful cducatonal force in
society." she said. "its effects are as in-
escapable as air pollution.” She added that
people are exported to 1.000 ads daily and
spend onc-and-a-hulf years of their lives
watching television commercials.

According to Klboumc. the statistics are
increasing. Little children watch television
at least half the day and see at least 1.000
different products advertised weekly. “in
the future. laser beams may be used to pro-
ject advertisement: onto clouds." she
added. '

"Ada reflect the values and mythology
of this culture and distort reality." she
said. “A distorted. illusory world has been

 

created.

She explained that men outnumber
women in advertisements in a ratio of over
two to one. “Moreover. almost everyone is
white. almost everyone is heterosexual in a
nuclear family. almost all women are
under 40. and there are no mental or
physical defects." she said, adding.
“unless you consider the housewives who
talk to men in toilet bowls." to which the
audience laughed.

in advertising, “there is a myth of pro-
gress. just as in society." she said. “but
women are shown as either sex objects or

0'. J0.” Kllboumo

 
 
  

as neurotic women obsessed with
cleanliness."

The message to men in ads is to be in-
vulnerabic and powerful. she said. “The
negative image of women affects men in
that anything in them that is ‘femininc'
such as displaying emotion is rejected."
she added. ‘

This message affects everything from
foreign policy to sexuality. she said.
“Advertising is not solely responsible for
sexism. but nothing is more persuasive."

Gawley vetoes
newly revised
election policy

By Angellna Wang
STAFF WRITER

The newly revised Student Associa-
tion Elections Policy. which would have
provided for some public ﬁnancing of
elections and also limits on advertising.
has been thrown out after Central
Council failed to override a presidential
veto last Wednesday.

The veto was SA President Steve
Guwley's first this year. An override at-
tempt fcll short of the 20 necessary votes
on a 13—16-0 ballot.

The presidential vcto was announced
to Council by Steve Russo. internal Af-
fairs chair. who also said, “in my opi-
nion. the entire veto rests on this point
of a $250 ASP (Albany Student Press)
ceiling." The Election Regulation Act
had allowed certain candidates to spend
up to $250 on advertising in the ASP.

"There was no limit on ASP uds
before. and this (Act) decided there
should be." Russo said. “You do not
have to trash the whole policy for this
one thing."

Russo was concerned that the whole
policy would have to be discussed.
