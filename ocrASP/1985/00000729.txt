Studies on sexual harassment in
the workplace have revealed that
10 percent of women surveyed
have been harassed and 52 per-
cent have quit or have been ﬁred
because Of harassment, according
to Gloria DeSole. SUNYA’s
Assistant to the President for Af-

Desoledirccted a discussion on
“Sexual Harassment in the
Academic Environment" Thurs-
day as part of_Women’s Safety
Alvareness Day.

' The term “sexual harassment"
was cOincd by Lin Farley, author
of Sexual Shakedown, in the
1970's and is deﬁned as “any un-

Over 40 student group representatives and
Resident Assistants met Sunday night to discuss
recent changes in SUNYA’s alcohol policy and
possible revisions the Student Advocacy and
Rights Coalition (SARC) might push. for.

The session followed a vote Thursday by
University Council to ban kegs and beerballs
from dorm rooms. Many of the students and
RA’s present said the rule is unenforceable.

Among the actions considered for any drive
against a ban, were a petition drive and mass
demonstrations both at the University and at
SUNY or Central in downtown Albany.

Student Association President Steve Gawley
stressed the need to “gain the support of Presi-
dent O'Leary and Vice~President Pogue. because
they hold a great deal of inﬂuence over Universi-
ty Council.” Gawley added, “I don’t think we
can sit silently, we have to make a strong
statement.”

“Students have already made a sensible and
eloquent argument. But obviously they didn't
argue loudly enough,” said Gawley. He added
that SA is organizing a mass student demonstra-
tion to express their disapproval of the policy.

“Our effort will bring this issue to every door
on campus and we’ll let students'decide whether
or not this policy is equitable," said Gawley.
referring to SA’s petition drive to be held this
weekend.

"‘everything Residential Life has been pushing

said the new policy was enforceable.

Steinberg said he attended another school
where a siirtilar ban was enacted. Most students,
he said, believed the policy was unenforceable
until "some people got busted” and others

Mild harassment includes leering,
unnecessary touching or patting,
and sexual favors. More serious
harassment includes demands or
threats for sex and actual physical
assault, she added.

Classroom harassment is evi-
dent mainly in condescending at—

‘titudes toward women, said

DeSole. “An instructor address-
ing the male students as Mr. So-
and-So and the female students as
“honey” or “sweetheart” is a
participator to this method and
adds to the invisibility of women
in the classroom," she said.
Women are frequently asked
about issues irrelevant in the
classroom such as concerns about

realized the college not only had the right but was ‘the home or relationships, said

enforcing the, policy."

Steinberg also said the ban will directly “affect
the Resident Assistant’s job if most students
believe it is unenforceable."

Betty Ginzburg, SA Director of Student Pro-
gramming said the policy would put RA's in a
“terrible position." RA’s, she said, are “friends
and advisors, and that if I had to hide a keg from
my RA, I wouldn't invite my RA in to share the
keg with me. I think RA's are one of the most im-
portant administrative parts of the University."

Ginzburg also criticized the new policy saying
“telling me what to drink and what I can drink it
from is an invasion of my privacy."

Greg Cardillo, an RA on Alumni Quad added,

for this year is to build community spirit in the
dorms and what this is going to end up doing is

in for anything.”

Cardillo and others also said that limiting the
availability of low—cost bulk containers will tempt
students to purchase hard liquor or use drugs,
which according to Cardillo, would make
students much harder to deal with.”

DeSole. adding that this shows
that only men's opinions count to
instructors.

Condcscension diminishes

women instead of enhancing
them, said DeSole. A glance or
remark that reminds women their
personal female selves as opposed
to their student selves is harass-
ment, she added.

Female graduate students,
female minorities and female
disabled students are victimized
the most, said DeSole. In each
group, there is an evident power
difference between the harassers
and the victim. “Harassment is
power expressed sexually," she
said.

Graduate students are very
vulnerable due to the lack of flex-
ibility in terms of classes or
departments, she said. “Graduate
students need to speak with their
professors, and they need that job

job, and obviously the professors
and people in her department
realize their power advantage,”
said DeSole.

Minority students and disabled
students usually find themselves
victims because they are perceived
as less powerful, DeSole added.

During DeSole’s presentation,
a ﬁlm was shown portraying sex-
ual harassment on the job. In it,
both men and women expressed
their feelings about harassment.
The film showed that both sexes
perceive sexual harassment
differently.

According to the interviews in
the film. men frequently dismiss
sexual harassment with, “0h. she
doesn't have a sense of humor.
Women — you know how they
are."
