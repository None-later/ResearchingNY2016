said women have the right to pursue and excel in

a career in science. but also have the right to br-
ing with them their personal values in an effort to
transform science to more humane and compas-

sionate standards.

Schweickart cited the voices of women around
the world who had been adversely affected by

science: a woman who lost her

of‘ all POW—MIA‘s was done." he added.
Pollicino said he does not think the war could
have been prevented. but he added that it could
have been better run. “We are listed as never losing
a battle but we lost the war. You could not shoot or
even put a round in the chamber until fired upon. i
didn‘t see people shooting just for the hell of it,” he

said.

in the last four years of the sex-
ual harassment program run by
SUNYA's Affirmative Action Of-
fice. 123 inquiries have been
made. Of those complaints, ap-
proximately 70 have asked for ac-
tqu aid in solving the problem;
about a dozen have filed written
grievances. said DcSolc.

A common feeling that many
women express is self-blame. said
DcSolc. Although there may be
certain characteristics that allow
one to be harassed more easily.
DcSolc stressed that “in no way is
a woman to blame herself."

in relationships based on power
differences. such as teacher-
student relationships, experiences

 

showed that no mule support was

 

their

fering from bronchitis due to working in dust all
day; and the garment worker. who toils for 16
hours a day for meager wages.

“These women can not be here today," she
said. “but they haunt us. How can we integrate
perspectives

and concerns into the

sciences?" She spoke of the need to bring the

voices of all

eye sight from

women together to create a

“discourse of values" in addressing the issue of
women and science.

Chair Ron McEckron said that the government was
able to carry on a war for 12 years without fully ex-
plaining why America was fighting.

“We (the Council) are not here to be right or left
but to tell the untold story because Vietnam has
touched everybody." said McEckron.

“No one here is looking for money — we‘re all

volunteers. and by virtue of the fact that we’re all

given. In relationships lacking
power differences. such as those
betwccm fellow workers or
students. many women received
hostility from men, DeSolc
added.

She also said that because of
lack of support. “Some women
reach the point where they actual-
ly believe they are inferior."

Lois Priver, Off-Campus
Association (OCA) representative
for the President's Task Force on
Women‘s Safety. asked DcSolc
how to stop subtle harassment
that can't be questioned. DeSole
replied. “Speak up. let everyone
hear the innuendos. Don't of-
fend. but express your discomfort
to him. if it persists. threaten to
report it.

veterans, we get together." McEckron said.

But some members of the
university community still believe
that the use of animals in ex-
periments is wrong. “I don't feel
that animals should be used for
arbitrary experiments,” said
Sonia DcIMonaco. a first-year
student. “Animals should be
totally free, not in labs or animal
factories.”

“When people say, ‘let's test
this drug on animals before using
it on humans to save Iives,’ that’s
understandable." she said. “But
most experiments seem inhumane
and pointless."

NEWS UPDA TES

Debate team shines

According to Vice-President Michael

' White. the Albany State Debate Team has

recently been ranked 13 in the Northeast
United States.

At the Suffolk University of Boston
Tourney. Diane Sepcnskl ﬁnished first in
the poetic interpretation category. in
poetic interpretation. the speaker gives a
brief introduction to a poem and then is
judged on his or her recitation of the work
said White. .

The team finished third overall at the
West Point Tourney. Ben Lido took
fourth place in the persuasive category.
Julien Ehrlich also came in fourth for her
after dinner speaking. White explained
that for “after dinner speaking" the
speaker chooses a topic of light origin that
is often humorous.

Gays added to code

The subcommittee of the Equal Oppor-
tunity Advisory Committee at Swarthmore
College has proposed a change in the Col-
lege's Corporate Code which would in-
clude a non-discrimination clause on the
“basis of sexual orientation and affec-
tional preference." according to inter-
collegiate Press.

Patricia Whitman. the Equal Oppor-
tunity advisor. named two consequences
that would result if the change was
adopted. “It becomes a strong symbolic
statement to the members of an oppressed
group” she said. Secondly, Whitman said,
“Legally, such a change would allow any
discriminated person to take their claim
outside of the college’s grievance pro—
cedure. Literally they can sue the college
for breach of contract." '

Whitman cautioned, however. _"1 am
firme of the belief that legal changes will
not affect attitudes."

‘Tis the season

Downtown Albany is preparing for two
of its winter traditions —-— the opening of

‘ Center.

the ice skating rink at Empire State Plaza
and the raising of the ofﬁcial New York
State Christmas Tree at the Capitol.

The rink is set to open at noon on Mon-
day, Nov. 18. Two sessions will be offered
Monday through Friday, from 12 noon to
2 p.m. and from 6 p.m. until 9 p.m. There
will be three sessions on weekends, from
12 noon to 2 p.m., 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., and 6
p.m. to 9 p.m. The weekend schedule will
be in effect from Dec. 26 until Jan. 1. but
the rink will be closed on Thanksgiving,
Christmas, and New Year’s Day. Skates
may be rented for $.50.

On Wednesday. Nov. 13. a 30-foot blue
spruce. donated by Mr. and Mrs. Albert
Engie of Schenectady. will be erected at
the Capitol. A second tree. donated by
Mrs. Grace Druzba. also of Schenectady.
will be erected at the Plaza on Tuesday,
Nov. 12. Both trees will be decorated by
Friday, Dec. 6 and will be lighted during a
ceremony at a later date.

Drinking for dollars

This year’s Afternoon at the Bars was a
success and helped Telethon raise approx-
imately $1.700 for the charities it is spon~
soring this year. according to Telethon co-
chair of events Maraya Gallo.

“The whole thing went over very well. i
believe everyone really enjoyed
themselves,” said Gallo. who added that
the amount raised was the most Telethon
has ever received from the event. Gallo
said that a good part of the money raised
came from rafﬂes for prize-ﬁlled balloons
initiated by the managers at the Lamppost.

This year. the bars that participated
were the Lamppost. the Long Branch.
Washington Tavern and O’Heaney’s. The
money raised at the event will go towards
this year's charities — the Albany Medical
Center’s Child Care Center, Spina Bifida
programs. and Parson's Child and Family
