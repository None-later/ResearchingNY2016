United States military aid and intcrvention in

Central AMerican countries must stop to help end

- current revolutions. according to Episcopalian
priest Gary Dorrien in his lecture Thursday as part
of Central America Awareness Week.

Speaking to a group of 25 people, Dorrien outlin-
ed the history of several Central American countries
which are currently involved in civil conflicts.

Through the media “we are told that these con-
flicts are between the guerrillas and the army. .They
keep missing who the conﬂicts are really hurting,"
Dorrien added. Over 70,000 people have died in
these conflicts since 1979.

Casualties have been highest among civilian non-
combatants. said Dorrien. Central American coun-
tries are “just full of poor peasants and i try to
speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.”

“i believe that U.S. foreign policy has historical-
ly exacerbated the problem,” said Dorrien. “We
have supported the military governments. not the
poor people’s movement,” he said.

“in Guatemala, like El Salvador. there is a small
group of landowners controlling the wealth,” said
Dorrien. 80 percent of the Guatemalan population
are peasants, he said. adding that “some of the
wealthy people are of the same families as the
wealthy people in El Salvador."

Guatemala has the worst humann-ights record of
all the Central American countries, Dorrien
charged.

“Honduras is probably the poorest country. it is

said Dorrien. adding that this has stirred a lot of
resentment.

According to a map prepared by the U.S. Center
for Defense information, there are seven U.S.—built
airfields and two more are planned.

According to information put out by the Center.

U.S. support of military governments in
Central AmeriCa said to undermine peace

Central America. The heaviest lighting is taking
place in El Salvador where the government armed
forces are battling 9-12.000 guerrillas, primarily of
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
(FMLN).

in Nicaragua, 1248.000 guerrillas, mainly from
the right wing, are ﬁghting the‘ieftistI Sandinista
government. The conﬂict ’has grown dramatically
during the last two years because the Central in-
teiligence Agency (CIA) has funded, supplied arms.
trained and directed guerrilla forces, according to
the Center. ' I: .

Guatemala has one of the world’s most repressive
military governments and is currently battling
5-6.000 leftist guerrillas and Mayan indians stated a
handout distributed by the Center.

Costa Rica has democratic conditions unlike any
of the other countries. said Dorrien. They have a
constitutional democracy. a substantial middle
class, and no lndian population, he said. Most of
the population live off of their own land, and they
have a self-sufficient, diversified. modern
economy, said Dorrien.

The United States keeps supplying these coun~
tries with military aid, said Dorrien. The revolu-
tions keep going on. as chain events from the past.
he said, adding that today there are groups that are
trying to get the U.S. to stop supplying aid and to
stop intervention there. Thousands of people keep
dying from all of the attacks. and if the U.S. keeps
supplying aid, more people will keep dying, he
added.

Dorrien is an assistant at St. Andrew‘s Parish,
and has written for magazines such as Christianity
on issues dealing with Central America.

Central America Awareness Week was sponsored

By Renee Bablch \
STAFF WRITER

Eighty percent of rapes reported by
students occur off campus\and 47 percent
of these are committed by men that the vic-
tims know. said Maggie Boys, a self-
defense instructor during a Thursday panel
discussion on “Living and Moving Safely
Off.”

The panel. led by Albany County Alder-
woman NAncy Burton was part of a series
of seminars held for Women’s Safety
Awareness Day. ’

_Burton relayed an experience from her
own neighborhood where a series of rapes
were committed last summer. On e woman
successfully escaped from the attacker and
sought refuge in Burton’s home. .

“This incident raised the consciousness
level of the neighborhood. It was a catalyst

in showing that the necessity for crime

He wants you to be bafﬂed and confused.
When you see the aggressive stage is when
you should get out," she said.

Paul DerOhannesian, the attome in
charge of the Albany District Attorney‘s
self-defense unit, said that he was involved
in a case of a power-rapist who was a door
to door salesman. DerOhannesian said he
was very. charming and the woman he
raped had invited him over to dinner.

Although he was guilty. DerOhannesian
said the rapist was not convicted because
the girl had invited him over and she was
not hurt. But. he added. this was the sixth
tiine this man had been charged with the
same offense. V

DerOhannesian added that date rape is a
widespread problem. He said that a major

prevention falls on citizens.” said Burton.
After this incident. the community held
two public awareness meetings and staged
a national “Night Out” where people in
the neihborhood sat outside on their
Stoops with their houses lit and got to
know their neighbors. said Burton.
Burton and the other panelists said that
it was important -to know the members of
your community. “Get to know your
neighbors so you have somewhere to run if
something happens,” said Burton.
According to‘ Boys, who cited statistics
from a nationwide survey of college
'students from an article entitled “Date
Rape -— A Story of an Epidemic and
Those WHO Deny it." one half of all
women said that they had been raped. and
12.5/ percent had been according to the
legal definition.
Boys added that the “more insidious

cessful is because of societal attitudes.
“People feel that if women show an signs

reason why a confidence rapist can be suc- .

. VietimiZed students often knew their attackers

of being physical, they are asking for it,
and the conﬁdence rapist knows this,” he
said.

Boys added that according to a study in
Los Angeles, “most teenage boys don't
believe it when a girl says no.”

Suggestions were offered by all the
panelists on what to do in case of attack.
F‘A general rule of thumb is the sooner you
begin to resist the better your chances of
getting away are,” said Boys, and added
that two thirds of women who resist suc-
cess in getting away. ‘

Burton said that, “although women
should go wherever they want. they should
not put themselves in places that are
dangerous, like dark roads."

.lim Williams. SUNYA Director of
Pubiic'Safety, said that although tear gas
is illegal. the “penalty for having it is
much less than that of being raped." Cl

 

problem of rape is acquaintance rape."
The self-defense classes taught by Boys '
teach women how to recognize potential
dangerous situations and the range of‘

possible responses one can have. “We
teach you how to react quickly and how to
yell. Yelling is one of the best defenses,”
she said.

‘ Another panelist, Judith Condo, also
spoke of acquaintance rape. The stages of
a typical date rape. according to Condo.
are first, the development of good rapport
by the male with the female. Second, there

is a shift from rapport to aggression where . his. hing u m of ‘

it is the offender‘s desire to dominate and I I I n
humiliate the woman so she will give in  ' .f

and have sex with him. she said. After: '"OﬂSIQIIOl' Mllll'ed
Ward, when he has been successful, he will

revert back to the rapport stage. where he m m  
wil probably exhibit some remorse for the Monday-Frldey

way he 'acted, she added.

Condo emphasized the con-man men-
tality of a rapist. “The ~objective is to
dominate and humiliate and he does this

by conning. it's a Jekyll and Hyde shift. 59 FUNDED
