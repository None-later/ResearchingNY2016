well debated.” he said. “If you vote for
the override (of this veto), I promise you
I will bring up this one section on the
media question next week wothout hav-
ing to debate the whole bill."

The bill was originally discussed for
six hours before being passed.

SA Media Director Doug Tuttie. say-
ing he spoke on Gawley’s behalf, said
that establishing a limit of $250 will lead
candidates to spend that much. “Let’s
not be afraid of opening up that debate
now because some of us have a better
understanding and only read the policy
for the ﬁrst time last week. Also. con-
sider the fact that there are some
adamantly opposed and for. this
policy.” he said. -

“There is more than one contention
besides the media,” Tuttle said. sug~
gesting a compromise in campaign
financing which would give those can-
didates who had enough signatures $50‘
before the election and $100 afterwards.

The act which Gawley vetoed would
have financed candidates with a max-
imum of $150 after the election.

“We are also not comfortable with
the ban on classroom posters.” Tuttle
added.

“Our advice to Steve (Gawley) was to
veto, and that's why he did. The Ex-

Among the ads Kilbourne presented in
her slide show was an ad for a bra which
stated, “. . . a new way to wrap your
package." According to Kilbourne, this
treats women’s bodies as objects and
teaches women how to relate to their
bodies.

“Objectification leads to violence,” she
said. “Turning a human being into an ob-

ject makes it easier to‘ become vilent
towards her,” she continued.

 

 

 

 

she said. “The underlying message is

paigns,".said Tuttie. .

’ Internal Affairs Vice Chair Nathaniel
Chamey told Council of the many hours
his subcommittee spent researching.
writing and passing the Election Regula-

tion Act. “The process is based on com- .

promise and the ‘basic laws of
democracy,” he saidfCharney said that
he didn't fully agree with the policy, but
that everyone worked on the policy
equally. ’

“Stop thinkingiabout yourselves and
individual opinion," Charney said.
“You should be thinking of Central
Council as a body. We as a whole
should accept thispolicy because we did
before." '

Larry Hartman, Student Action
Chair, pointed out the policy was passed
at the Central Council’s first long
meeting of the year. The bill’s passage,
he said, had more to do with the fact
that it was “ 1:30 in the morning and not
because people were satisfied.”

The question of campaign financing
and whether or not "students want their
tax money to be spent to finance peo-
ple's campaigns was something We never.

“The most offensive ad campaign is that

douches, KilbOurne said. “They'lthe pro-
ducts] are insulting, degrading and
dangerous. it makes womenhate their

A recent ad in TV Guide shown by
lCilbourne said. “Feminine odor is
everyone’s problem."

Beating out schools like Har-
vard and Boston University,
SUNYA’s chapter of the Associa-
tion for Computing Machinery
(ACM) took! firSt place in the
Northeast ACM programming
competition held October 28.

The victory entitles the team to
represent the Northeastern
United States in an international
competition to be held in Cincin-
nati this February.

According to SUNYA's ACM
president Scott Kashan, the team
consisted of four members: Jon
Leslie, Dave Miller, Scott
Ginsburg and himself. Thirteen
teams of four members each par-
ticipated in the contest.

“Each team is given six pro-
blems to solve in six hours,” said
Kashan. “1n the case that more
than one team finishes all six pro-
grams, the winning team is the
one who finishes them in the least
amount of time," he said.

Kashan explained that each
team submitted their programs to
the judges as they were com-
pleted. The judges then ran the
program and if it worked, the

“This creates disgust and
loathing of women’s bodies.
Substitute in another oppressed
group and examine the ad," she
said,‘ suggesting inserting any
ethnic group’s name instead of
“feminine.”

Kilbourne also discussed other
trends in advertising, including

time that it was submitted was
logged. '

Kashan attributed the team’s
success to the strategy they used.
“Other schools work each pro-
gram together but we split the
work so that each person writes
one program,” he said. “This
makes us able to solve more pro-
blems in less time," he added.

The team’s trip to the regional
competition was funded by the
College of Mathematics and
Sciences. The trip to the competi-

_ tion in Cincinnati will be funded

partly by the college and partly by
ACM, Kashan said.

According to Kashan, the
SUNYA team was successful last
year as well. “This is the second
year in a row that we’ve won the
regional,” he said. Last year the
international contest was held in
New Orleans and Albany placed
20th among 24 teams from a1
over the world. '

Scott Ginsburg is the only
member of the current team who
was also on last year‘s team,
Kashan said.

Kashan added, “1 hope we can
keep the tradition of winning go-
ing next year."

sado-masochism. "In a window
of a shop, the window dresser
created this scene — a woman's
[mannequin’s] bloody corpse with
men's shoes positioned on it and a
sign saying ‘We kill for these'.”

“In this, you're asked to iden-
tify with the attacker instead of
the victim,” she continued.

SUNYA takes first place in compUter contest

“1 think it [the victory] is great
for us as well as for the school.”
Kashan said. “it will put SUNY
Albany on the map for Computer
Science as well as academics. We
beat Harvard and Boston Univer-
sity this year and MIT last year,”
he said. "if this doesn’t help the
school’s reputation. 1 don’t know
what will," he added.

ACM is an organization with
members throughout the world.
“1t is open to faculty, students,
business people and anyone else
interested in computing," Kashan
said.

The organization holds con-
ferences throughout the year. said
Kashan. At the main conferences
in the spring and the fall, an
employment register with
representatives from 200 com-
panies is held. interviews are con-
ducted during the conference and
papers are presented by people in
the field for critical review.
Kashan added that the program-
ming contest is also part of the bi-
annual conference.

Students seemed very impress-
ed with the presentation. “What
impressed me is that she treated it
more than something that affects
women, but something that af-
fects everyone,” said Verne E.
Baker, a senior at SUNYA. “She
made the issue mush clearer." he
added.
