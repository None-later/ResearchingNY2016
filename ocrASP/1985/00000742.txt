he worlds of in-

tics and inter-
national dance
collide in Taylor Hacie-
ford ’s “White Nights"
when dancers become
defectors across both
sides of the Iron Cur-
tain. “‘White Nights" is
an action-adventure

film, of high suspense

and personal drama." says Hackford
who directed the film.

Ballet star Mikhail Baryshnikov
plays a Russian dancer who defects
to the West but is brought back home
by a plane crash in the USSR. Greg-
ory Hines is an American entertainer
living in Russia ordered by the Sovi-
cts to make sure Baryshnikov stays.

“Baryshnikov and Hines (whose
sense of morality made him desert
front the army during the Vietnam
War) form a wary relationship." ex-
plained Haekford. "it's a totally hy-
pothetical story. but one that every
defector has imagined."

“We had nightmares." admits Bar-

yshnikov of his real-life defection.
Playing in his first film role since The
Turning mint. Baryshnikov finds
himself reliving the most traumatic
events of his own life.

The “white nights" of the title—
the long Russian summer nights—-
“are a stylistic point in the ﬁlm," says
llackford. “The ﬁlm takes place to»
tally in daylight. There is no place to
hide. Baryshnikov‘s character can't
get away from the light."

All this and some of the best danc-
ing in the world as well. But. as direc»
tor llackford (whose Q/Iicer and a
Gentleman and Against All Odds es-
tablished his gift for intense roman-
tic drama) asserts. "it is important to
say that. although it stars Mikhail Bar»
yshnikov and Gregory ilines and has
nine dancers. it is not a ditnce iilm.

"Dance is used in an experimental
wayﬂto pick tip the dramatic action
and move it forward. The film ex-
plores defection from the point of
view of two men: Baryshnikov. the
Russian who gave up his politics for
his art. and Mines. the American who
gave up his art for his politics."
