rior to the release of Roc/ey III.
P Sylvester Stallone told an inter-

viewer that “1 love the character
too much to do a Rocky IV and have
people go away disappointed and
say we bled it dry. So this is it."

After Roe/qr lll went on to outgross
both of its predecessors, however.
Stallone underwent a change of
heart. The result is Rocky [if to be
released November 27 by MGM/UA.

Since May, a record-breaking 4200
trailers have been warning viewers to
“get ready for the next world war.“
Of course. as most of us know by
now, the “war” involves the confron-
tation between Rocky Balboa and
Drago (who's played by Dolph
Lundgren). his gargantuan Russian
opponent in the ring.

Rocky IV marks the end of Carl
Weathers‘ ongoing participation in
the series. since Apollo Creed
(whom Weathers ponrays) is killed
in the ring when he goes up against
the Soviet giant.

Will Rocky avenge his buddy's
death and K0 the Russian champ?
One thing‘s for sure. the $12 to $15
million (plus a percentage of the
gross) that Sly‘s receiving for writing,
directing and starring in Rochy IVhas
already made Stallone the winner.

KYLE COUNTS: The word
on your big break in comedy is
that you were visiting Califor-

you and signed you for “Make

wonderful cast, a mixture of total un-
knowns and flegling stars," said Sir
Richard enthusiasti ‘ally.

The hardest role to cast was that of
Zach. the director/choreographer
who forces the 17 dancers in his cast
to reveal themselves. “Michael
Douglas is magnetic in the role of
this god-like but vulnerable charac-
ter." Attenhorough praised.

The plum role of Cassie. the ex-
lead dancer trying to stun over again
in the chorus, went to Alyson Reed
who had portrayed the pan in the na-
tional company of Chorus Line. ‘1
have a lot of Cassie in me," she says.
"All I've ever known is dancing."

It was a challenge to turn A Chorus
Line into a screenplay without los
ing, “the theatricality that is its es-
sence." says Attenborouglt. “I‘ve
been wanting to do a musical for a
long time. What I particularly en»
ioyed about A Chorus Line was the
ensemble feeling of the cast. The
wonderful thing about this ﬁlm is
that everybody gets to b ~ a star."
