UAS to decide fate of bookstore

By Jim Avery
STAFF WRITER

The future management of
SUNYA's bookstore rests in the
hands of a committee which has
yet to be formed. as Barnes and
Noble approaches the end of their
ﬁve-year contract with University
Auxiliary Services.

Barnes and Noble has operated
the bookstore since l98l, and
whether or not it wil continue to
do so is up to the bookstore com-
mittee of the University Auxiliary
Services (UAS) Board of Direc-
tors. Membership of the commit-
tee has not yet been determined.

“The committee has always
started this late.” said Karleen
Karlson. Assistant Dirctor of
Residential Life. who has been
appointed chairperson of the
committee for the last two years,
adding,“That‘s been a criticism
I‘ve had."

John Hanigan. Vice President
of Finance and Business and an
eight-year veteran of the UAS
Board of Directors said he does
not feel the present schedule inv
hibits the contracting process.
Norbert Zahm. General Manager

According to Zahm. in the
past. bids in the falhave been
taken as late as November and
December. As far as choosing a
book vendor, Zahm said,“We'd
be aiming at late spring to make a
decision. A lot of campuses don’t
make those decisions until sum-
mer and that’s clearly too late."

When formed. there are three
avenues the committee could
take. according to Zahm. it could
open the ﬂoor to bidding from
competing retail firms, renew the
current contract with Barnes and
Noble, or put UAS back in the
bookstore business.

The UAS Board next meets on
November 15 and committee ap.
pointments may be made at that
meeting. Once the bookstore
committee has been formed. the
contract process can begin. said
Zahm.

During the SUNYA
bookstore’s early years, “the
bookstore was run by FSA
(Faculty Student Association),
the original form of UAS. at great
ﬁnancial loss," said l-Iartigan.
FSA operated the bookstore on
the late 60’s and early 70’s until
continued ﬁnancial difficulties

Follett College Stores.

“At that point lease-operated
stores were a relative rarity.” said
Zahm. Speaking of 'the Chicago-
based Follett College Stores. he
said.“They were probably the
largest lease operator in the
country." A
Follett held a three-year contract
and then. a fiveyear contract
with SUNYA. Then.“We looked
at all of the other companies.
With the size store we have, we
wanted the leased service of the
highest reputation.” said Zahm.
The SUNYA bookstore contract
is approaching 34.000.000. he
added.

“They've always been very
responsive in the past," said
Karlson, describing Barnes and
Noble. She added,“ Barnes and
Noble has always preferred to
handle problems directly. if you
have a problem. you can deal with
it yourself. The manager of
Barnes and Noble has been very
approachable."

0n campus banking facilities
may also undergo some changes
in the near future. although the
three-year contract Marine

Let’s clean up Pine Bush

The SUNY Albany College Republicans are
organizing a day-long program designed to clean
the Pine Bush. according to the group’s presi-
dent. Stevcn Korowitz.

Pine Bush is a region in Albany County “with
unique environmental conditions and it's not be-
ing taken care of properly." said Korowitz. ad-
ding. “we wanted to make the community aware
of their environment and the problems involved
in its upkeep."

Any student interested in helping out can con-
tact Korowitz at 442-638l or just meet at the gym
at 10:30 AM. Transportation will be provided.

Bubble plans burst

The expected completion date for the ‘bub-
ble" which is to be erected next to the gym has
been set back due to delays brought on by the
weather. said Dennis S. Elkin, Facilities Coor-
dinator for the Athletics Department.

The bubble will be a temporary recreation
facility which will house basketball, volleyball,
and tennis courts, Elkin said, adding that there
will also be a jogging area around the courts.

The next steps in the construction process in-
clude the installation of the asphalt floor and
electrical systems. followed by the inﬂating of the
bubble, Elkin said.

The bubble is being installed to temporarily
relieve the overcrowding at the gym until the
planned ﬁeldhoused is built and it is uncertain
whether it will remain in place after the
ﬁeldhousc is built. Elkin said.

A partial outage of the ’l‘clccom Communica-
tions System resulted in a loss of some phone ser-
vice on the academic podium on Tuesday. accor-
ding to Gary Pclton. Director of the Telephone
Systems Office.

The outage. said Pclton. occurred because any
new system must undergo a “burn-in" period in
which periodic purtiul shut-downs are to be ex-
pected. The system operates with two central
processing units (CPU). which “perform routine
diagnosis on the quality of the system." said
Pelton.

if the CPUs find a problem. as was thc case on
Tuesday. said Pelton. “the system is designed in
such a way that only a portion of the system is
shut down until the problem can be fixed."

No sex is trendy sex

Celibacy is on the rise in the United States. ac-

cording to Penthouse Magazine‘s informal
survey published in their December issue. V

College students are also changing their sexual
ways. Based on a l984 study at the University of
Northern lowa. 44 percent of the students v
surveyed had had sex with someone they did not
want to marry compared to 69 percent ten years
earlier.

“Contrary to popular belief, celibates do not
hate sex and they are not all women,” said
researcher Gary Hanaven. “in fact. 40 percent of
our respondents reported ‘very strong' sex
drives," he added.

in addition. celibacy is not a permanent
lifestyle. Given the chance. people usually expect
to end their celibacy in a few years, Hanaven
said.

Rat opens doll window

A new deli window has been opened at the Rat
in order to alleviate the crowding there at lun-
chtime and to offer a greater variety to students.
according to Jay McClure. a manager at the Rat.

The window. which is next to the cafeteria in
the Rat. “hadn’t been used as a service bar."
said McClure. “since business has slacked off.
We opened the deli to relieve the heavy lunch
business." he said.

The deli opened last Monday. said McClure.
adding. “A lot of people took notice because we
were busy that night.” It offers three or four
types of sandwiches. soda. and munchies. and is
open seven days a week. said McClure.

McClure said that although the deli window
does not currently accept meal cards, “we are ex-
pecting a card reader next week” for students
with the Campus Center Option.

Surrogate Santas sought

The March of Dimes is searching for
volunteers to play Santa.

On Nov. 23_through Dec. 23. the March of
Dimes will be holding a “phoms with Santa”
fundraiser at the Northway Mall in Colonic.
Volunteers are needed to play Santa and help
take these holiday photographs. No experience is

Consumer issues tranSlate into employment

By LindatGreenberg
STAFF WRITER v

Improving consumer relations is top
priority for many private businesses and
the job-market in the consumer ﬁeld is ex-
panding rapidly. according to speakers at a
consumer conference Thursday.

“Jobs in the Consumer Field.” a stu-
dent workshop given as part of a series of
workshops at the Consumer Awareness
Conference at the Empire State Plaza in
downtown Albany. Thursday, November
14 also included an informative lecture on
consumer affairs.

The moderator of the discussion was
Patrice Jenkins, of the Greene County
Cooperative Extension, and keynote
speakers included Joanne Gage, a Con-
sumer and Public Affairs Specialist for
Price Chopper Supermarkets and Jay
Halfon. Legislative Director for the New
York Public interest Research Group
(NYPIRG).

Gage, who has worked for Price Chop«
per since 1983. spoke about consumerism
in business and the private sector. Accor-
ding to Gage. “The consumer department
(of a business) may be looked upon as a
department that costs money as an expense
for that business, rather than earning
money."

But. she added. “When the business
becomes more enlightned as to what role
this department plays. it realizes that the
consumer department will generate good-
will. which in turn. will increase sales."

The role of a consumer department is
two-fold. said Gage. First. “Our depart-
ment acts as a watchdog. keeping an eye
on the relationship between the merchan-
diser and thd consumer. it takes care of
customer comments. whether they be com
pliments. suggestions. or complaints. Our
goal is customer satisfaction.” Gage
explained. 7 _

supporting he merchandising team. “Our
department must be part of sales and mer-
chandising. We must work closely with
them in order to have clout. to be part of
what‘s going on.” said Gage.

The consumer department is responsible
for educating customers. According to
Gage. “This is done at the point-of-sale."
New developments at Price Chopper to
achieve this goal include informative pam-
phlets whose aim is to educate the public.

“I get a personal .
satisfaction . . . prote-

areas as well. The goal is to influence the
passage of legislation that is in the interest
of consumers." said Halfon.

“NYPIRG has gotten involved in a wide
range of consumer issues." said Halfon.
He gave two speciﬁc examples of the
cancer-causing effects of toxic substances.
such as asbestos in the workplace. and
DEIS daughters whose mothers were given
the cancer~causlng DES drug to prevent
miscarriages years ago.

“As a consumerist. i want to see justice
done regarding hazardous consumer pro
ducts. i get a personal satisfaction in tak-
ing part in a social justice campaign. and

Two such pamphlets are “Very Special
Vegetables” which serves as a guide to try-
ing and preparing specialty vegetables. and
“Light and Lean.” which informs
customers about lean cuts of meat and
nutritional ways in which to prepare them.

The consumer department is also con-
cerned with establishing and maintaining
good community relations. “Price Chop-
per is very active in community events.
One project we do is senior citizen busing,
which is a help to the community,” com-
mented Gage.

Gage concluded, “By fostering good
will. we are accomplishing two goals at
once. We satisfy our goal of keeping
customers happy, and at the same time. we
keep customers. which makes for a pro-
fitable business." .

The second speaker. Halfon. who is a
lobbyist for NYPIRG. discussed con-
sumerism in the public sector.

in the public sector, “consumer action
deals with the areas of insurance. the auto
industry. the banking industry. and other
