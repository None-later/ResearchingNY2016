TV needs to make room for fair minority roles

By E. Paul Stewart
MINORITY AFFAIRS EDITOR

The Cosby Show, which airs
Thursday evenings at 8:00 PM on
NBC, has returned this year for
what hopes to be another promis-
ing season. The show, which stars
Bill Cosby, Phyllis Ayer-Allen

and several

Beyond

ethnic minority) family in the
and have a stable family at-

talented co-

stars is perhaps 

wise portrayal ' '

of a black (or 
history of television. They are up-
wardly mobile, highly educated
mosphere. In a sense, they could
be described as black “yuppies.”

 

“Must we be resigned to being cast
as Chico, Rooster and Huggy
Bear?”

 

Another very positive point to
be made about the show is that it
has been very well received by a
cross-selection of the population:
young and old. white and black.
That is the determining factor for
any black show to be successful
on network television.

There is one issue which

plagues me as a minority.

however, in spite of my extreme
like and respect for the Cosby
Show, and that is the media’s
(network television in particular)
lack of awareness that there are
more minority professionals and
more ways to depict a positive

minority image than a sitcom.

There has never (to my recollec-
tion) been a serious television pro-
gram with a minority main
character or family. If there isn’t
room for a network drama with a
mainly minority cast, why not try
a Hispanic “Matt Houston" or a
black “Dan Tanna” (Vegas)?

Although they may not ex-
emplify black life in America, at
least as “good guys" they portray
an image for mino'rity youth.
'Must we be resigned to being cast
as “Chico” (Chico and the Man).
“Rooster” (the pimp on Barretta)
and “Huggy Bear” (the flim flam
man on Starsky and Hutch)
rerun? I shall never resign myself
to that.

In real life some of these people
do exist, but they don't represent
me and they don’t represent the
masses. Obviously, the powers

_that be in the television industry
have yet to realize these facts.

There are a great many Black

and Hispanic actors and ac-
tresses, longing for the opportuni-
ty to display their talent. Since
that talent is by no means in short
supply. there is no reason for
Hollywood not to take advantage
of their availability. When
Hollywood finds a Black come-
dian they seize the opportunity to
exploit him to the fullest. When
will they utilize the abundance of
serious minority actors and, more
importantly, when will we de-
mand it?

If we as viewers (and especially

of the minority concern) continue
to accept any and everything that
Hollywood "dishes out", the
quality of television (and our por-
trayal in it) will never improve.
My advice: support the Cosby
Show because it‘s good and it’s
hopefully a new beginning, but
ask for more, expect more and de-
mand more. Why? Because there
is more to us and we deserve to
have it’showcased. El

(AP) — The . House Education, and
Labor Committee approved a bill Tuesday
that would double the amount
undergraduates could borrow in their last
two years of college and give new teachers
afive-year grace period on repayingloans.

The rewrite of- the Higher Education Act
would also extend for ﬁve more years the
whole network of federal grant, loan and
work-study programs that provide about
$9 billion annually in aid to half the na-
tion’s 12 million college students.

In a move to make parents share in the
costs of their children’s education, the bill
would require all students under age 23 to
report their parents’ income when seeking
ﬁnancial aid. unless the students are mar-
ried, orphans. military veterans or other-
wise financially independent.

“The ﬁeldhouse is fundamentally a recrea-
tion facility and not a spectator facility,"
he added.

Kriss said he expected the exchange to be
made on equal value instead of equal
acreage. “It's much easier for them and
for us if there is no exchange of money."

“I don’t expect there to be ay real pro—
blems With the the exchange),” Kriss said.
“It would be beneficial to both par<
ties...We'll do our best to see that the
technical difﬁculties will be worked out in
the simplest ‘way possible," he said.

A Chapel House committee is drawing a
conceptual plan of the new building, which
is being designed for either of its two possi-
ble locations, Kriss said. A ﬁnal draft of
the proposal is expected in early
December, at which time an architect will

“We weren't throwing students out in
the past,” said Linnan. “but we don’t
know what we’re going to do in the
future," provided that the law is upheld.

Oliver said he felt that Linnan's
arguments were invalid. “Obviously. the
judge thought so,” he said, adding that
Torraca rejected LinnaII's argument that
the papers were improperly placed.

“The city made it clear they would deny
getting permits for rooming houses," said
Oliver. “Roaming houses are short-term
residences, notxapartmertts," he added.

“The attitudes expressed by Mr. Mama
and the city are'typical anti-student at-
titudes," said Oliver. “It’s clear the courts
will not permit this retaliatory action," he
added, referring to the city actively evic-
ting students because of the legal action.

“The city has no defense — that's all —
no defense," Oliver continued.

“The Appellate Division, Second
Department, held that the Oyster Bay
Grouper Law violated the New York State
Constitution because the restrieitons

“This policy treats students as
children," said Abelow. “The idea that
students will be more tempted to drink
beer from a” beerball than from a can is
ridiculous," he added.

“The administration is kidding
themselves if they think that banning
beerballs and kegs will solve the alcohol

The bill would raise the maximum Pell
Grant — outright-scholarships based on
need. —- from $2,100 to $2,300 for the
1987—88 acedemic year. There would be
3200 increases annually through 1991-92,
when the maximum Would hit $3,100.

The measure would retain the current
$2,500 limit on how much college students
could borrow in their ﬁrst two years, but
,allow juniors and seniors to borrow
735,000. Graduate students, now limited to
$5,000 in Guaranteed Student Loans an-
nually, could borrow up to $8,000. _

It would require all students, not just
those with family incomes above $30,000,
to demonstrate need before getting the
subsidized loans.

The grace period for new. teachers is
designed to attract more people to the pro-
fession. Currently, there is no grace period

The new Chapel House will most likely
include a large general worship area and
two small chapels for both the Christian
and Jewish faiths, Kriss said. The building
will also need ofﬁce space and baths
kosher and standard kitchen facilities, he
said. “We hope to make the house more
accessible to the Jewish community and a
kosher kitchen would do just that.”

The new building will require an
estimated $450,000 in funds, Kriss said. all
of which he hopes casn be raised through
donations from the community. The ﬁrm
of Button and Button has been hired to
coordinate the fund raising project, with
SUNYA student T.J. Starr coordinating
efforts on campus. .

Kriss said Chapel House has already
been receiving unsolicited gifts from alum-
ni who have heard that Chapel House
burned down in May. El

said.

“Oyster Bay is all single family dwell-
ings, while Albany is a I-, 2., and 3~family
zone where population density is much
higher than in a residential area," he said,
adding that the “population density issue
has some justiﬁcation...but it has no ap-
plication to a large city with multi-family
residence zones."

Oliver commented that the Belle Terre
ruling dealt with the federal constitution
and has “no relevance to this case."

“We’re confident that the Albany
Grouper Law will be struck from the
books," he added.

Gawley, said, ‘ ‘This is a solid victory for
students pending final deliberation."

Commenting on the stay, Gawley added
that, “the stay is pertinent to the plain-
tiffs, (but) we have mechanisms for protec-
ting any student who runs into trouble
with the Grouper Law."

“I think that with a large turnout next

administration to succumb to the
pressure and permit kegs and beerballs

More .student loan funding seen in Housebill

for new teachers on repaying college loans.

Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., who spon-
sored the provision said the nation’s shor-
tage of teachers “is disgraceful. It borders
on the criminal."

The bill also would phase out over ﬁve
years the 5 percent origination fe that
students now must pay when they take out
loans.

The measure would lift the interest rate
on Guaranteed Student Loans to 10 per-
cent during the ﬁfth year of repayment.
The rate now is 8 percent for ﬁrst-time
borrowers.

The committee approved the measure by
a 26-2 vote. Two Texas Republicans, Steve
Bartlett of Dallas and Richard K. Armey
of Benton, a former college professor,
voted against the bill.
