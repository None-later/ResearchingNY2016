Women heaters close season at NYSAIAWs

By Marc Paseltlner

The Albany State women’s soc-
cer team recently ﬁnished their
season with a solid performance
at the NYSAIAW Championships
at Brockport. A 4-3 win over
fourth seeded Nazareth
highlighted the team’s appearance
in the tournament.

The Danes were seeded last in
the eight team competition and
were forced to play ﬁrst-seeded
University of Rochester in their
opening game of the single
elimination tournament.

The women put on a good
show as they held Rochester to a
scoreless tie through the ﬁrst half.
Despite losing 3-0, Albany State
head coach Amy Kidder called the
Danes' performance “very
respectable."

After losing to Rochester, the
team was sent into the consola-
tion round against another tough

team in Nazareth. The Danes
went into the game without the
services of Mary Dulkis, a key
player for the Danes who was
sidelined with an injury.

' It was a game of tug-of-war as
both teams took turns scoring,
neither giving the other the edge
for too long.

Nazareth struck first at 3:30 in-
to the game and kept their 1-0
lead until 29:35 of the first half
when Cheryl Hensen fed Joanna
Lazarides for the Danes first goal.

The Hensen to Lazarides con-
nection clicked again for the
Danes at 33:50 to give Albany a
2-1 lead. Nazareth quickly tied it
up with a goal at 35:50. The ﬁrst
half ended with the teams
deadlocked at 2-2.

The second half started with a
rare miss of a penalty kick by
Dane midﬁelder Kim Kosalek.
There was no scoring until 50:50

Seahawks and Danes playoff

when Hensen scored unassisted.
Nazareth again knotted the score
with a goal at 61:20 on a penalty
kick.

It wasn’t until 85:35 when Joan
McNamara scored an unassisted
goal that somebody would regain
the lead. I

For the third game of the tour-
nament, the women faced St.
Lawrence, a team that had beaten
Albany 4-0 during the regular
season.

A goal at 4:10 by St. Lawrence
set the tone of the game as the ex-
hausted Danes were unable to
muster the strength to come back.

Kidder considered the Danes’_ '

performance in the tournament a
big success, and called the victory
over Nazareth the biggest one of
the year, as the team came
together to play some of their
strongest soccer of the season.D

Wagner enjoys the homefield advan-

Wagner has received from its environ-

Seahawk's rank in the nation's poll.

“It’s (rank) definitely misleading.
Wagner is in the New York City area, so
they receive so much more favorable press,
and that's what the rankings are based
on,"vsaid Czarnecki.

Kwiatkowski agreed that the rankings
were an unfair basis for playoff considera-

tion, but he didn't think a school‘s loca-
tion determined its placement.

“1 don't think it’s fair to say Wagner is
ranked so high because of their
geographical area," said Kwiatkowski.
“What's unfair is that Albany is not rank—
ed. It’s tough to crack the barrier; the

Grapplers to defend Great Dane Classic title

By Cathy Errig, ,-
smnr wanna . . I
The 1985586 season,opens in a
classic manner for the Albany
State Wrestlingvteam tomorrow.»
The seventh annual Great Dane
Classic. which involves between
15-20 collegiate teams, including
four from‘ Division I schools,
begins at 10:00 a.ni. at University
Gym. The ﬁnal matches will wind
down between 6:00-7:00‘p.m.

“The ﬁnals Gian be star-studded ~

matches,"~ said head coach J0e
DeMeo. “TheJCIassicgivespeo-
ple a chance to see top—caliber

collegiatestyie wrestling." I *-
The Danes, the Classic's defen-'

ding champions, took four of the
tournament’s 10_ weight classes
last year. " However, .of those
champions, which included Dave
Averill, (126), Andy Seras, (158),
Marty Fidel, (177), and Sandy
Adelstein, (190), only Pidel is
returning, prompting DeMeo to
predict a ﬁfth place ﬁnish for his
Danes.

“Fifth is where I’d thought
we'd ﬁnish last year,” said
DeMeo, “But last year we had
defending champs return. This

year, we have guys who finished ,

second or third returning.”
Albany’s toughest competition
will come from Division I
Syracuse, whom the Danes nar.
rowly defeated for the Classic title
last year. The University of New
Hampshire, Boston University,
and Boston College and .Spr-
ingﬁeid a Division II team that
narrowly defeated the Danes last
season in dual competition last
season, are also strong contenders

weight class this year. ‘

for the championship.

DeMeo considers the higher
weight classes to be his team's
strengths. “From 177 to
Heavyweight, I’m not too wor—
ried,” said DeMeo. “We’ve got a
lot of depth and experience at
those weights.”

A break-down of the Danes’
contenders at each weight
follows:

118 lbs. — The Danes' only con-
cern at this weight is whether. or
not junior Shawn Sheldon will be
able to make a quick transition
from Greco-Roman, wrestling to

Co'legiate style. The 5’4" I985
SUNYAC champion, second in
the Classic last year, just returned
from Sweden Tuesday, where he
placed fourth in the Greco-
Roman World Cup. Sheldon will
be backed by freshman Isaac
Ramaswamy, who took second in
the Empire State Games this
summer.

126 and 134 — The Danes are
vulnerable at these weights due to
Averill’s graduation and John

., Balog’s decision to wrestle at 142.

The Classic will serve as testing
ground for freshmen ,Pete An-
drew, Dave Waxman, and Andy

Gordon at 126, and Paul Prosser
and Dave Pause at 134.

142 — Junior John Balog is the
Danes’ biggest threat at this
weight. The 5’8" Balog was third
in the tournament last year, and
went on to qualify for the NCAA
tournament.

150 — Senior Jim Fox, second in
the Classic last year while wrestl-
ing at 142, makes this another
strong weight for the Danes. Like
Balog, Fox also placed at last
year's SUNYAC tournament, and
qualiﬁed for the NCAAs.

158 — The weight synonomous

with Andy Seras' name last year
will be handled by sophomore
Arne Soldwedal this season.
Soldwedal, a 5’10” transfer from
Adirondack Community College
placed fourth in the pre-season
West Point tournament, a com-
petition similar to the Classic.

167 — This weight is another pro-
ving ground for the Danes, since
Marty Pidei is moving up to wres-
tle 177. Freshman Mike Simon. a
5’8” all league wrestler from
Brentwood, is the Danes' leading
contender. ‘ .

177 -— Fidel was the Classic
champion at 167 last year, and the
5'11" New Paltz native was na-
tionally ranked through most of
last season at 167. His presence
should make this one of the
Danes’ strongest weights.

190 — The Danes have the luxury

_of two experienced top quality

wrestlers at this class. 5'9 1/2”
Matt Ryan was second at this
weight last year, losing to team-
mate Sandy Adelstein in the ﬁnal.
Jake Sabo, a junior transfer from
Nebraska, is a two-time Division I
NCAA qualiﬁer.

Heavy Weight -— Dc Meo’s only
regret in reviewing his team’s
competitors in this class is that
although the Danes possess two
excellent heavyweights, juniors
Chris Tironi and Ivan “The Terri-
ble" Katz, there can only be one
winner. Katz, who was third last
year. has improved enormously,
according to DeMeo. 'I‘ironi, a
graduate of SUNY Cobbleskill.
was fourth at last year's National
Junior College Championships. [1

Albany StateWOmenswimmers to host Relays

By Doreen Clark _

The Albany State women’s swim team
eo-hosts the Great Dane Relays with the
men’s team on Saturday.

The team hopes to take a ﬁrst, second or
third place trophy in the all day
competition.

The season, which lasts until Februrary
15, 'will include fourteen meets and a
winter training session in Puerto Rico.

The team of 26 swimmers and divers is
coached by David Turnage and assistant
coach Caroline Schariock and headed by
co-captains Clair Blarthow, Jane Klotz,
and Carol Pearl.

Two years ago. Klotz qualiﬁed for na-
tional competition in' diving: A spring
semester in France prevented her from div-
ing for the team last year. Pearl is absent
from the team for the fall semester as she is
currently an exchange student in England.
She plans to return in the spring to defend
many of the records that she currently
holds. '

A long, long season could come to an

them offer positive contributions, some of
the newcomers show an exceptional
amount of promise.

Freshmen Robyn Roche, in the
breastroke, and Genne Cuniff, in the
backstroke and sprints, are expected to be
record breakers by the end of the season.
Freshmen Christine Gay/Icy and Marcy
Geisser are expected to be close behind in
both categories of swimming and diving. ‘

The team lost only three members last
year. seniors Kris Monahan and Jewel
Rambo, and junior Mary Ann Schmit. All
returning members are considered to be
stronger than last year. Returnees Sue
Rhib and Carol Ely are expected to greatly
improve their events as compared tovlast
year. Last year’s ‘Most Improved Person’,
Pepper Schwatz, is also expected to do well
this season. V A

The team dropped from thirty women
last year to twenty six. As assistant coach
Caroline Schariock said, “The team is
smaller this year. but with the addition of a

1978." said head coach Bob Munsey.

Besides consistently strong teams like
Fredonla and St. Lawrence, Albany will
face some surprising new teams.

“lthaca and SUNY Buffalo have really
come on this season," said Munsey.

Even though the outlook for the team is
dim. there is still a chance for Albany to
send individual runners to the nationals.
The top six individuals not on one of the
three qualifying teams, also qualify for
nationals.

“A couple of guys have fairly good
shots at qualifying.” said harrler Chuck
Bronner.

and Tim Hoff each have an outside chance
of going.”‘sald Munsey. Cl

few good freshmen, the team is even
stronger. The smaller number produced a
more cohesive group with more
camaradarie and motivation than has been
seen with the larger teams.”

While according to Turnage, the team is
“working hard and stronger than last
year,” it still may face some stiff competi-
tion. RPI, the team’s rival, has done
strong recruiting for the season. Other
tough meets 'will be against Hamilton Col-
lege. Skidmore College, and SUNY Cor-
tland. Yet Turnage says that the swimmers
already have good times and he hopes to

:improve on last year's 876 record.

. According to diving coach Jim Serbalik,
“It's nice to have four divers, we've never
had that before.” Referring to Klotz and
Michael Vardy, a member of the men's
team, he said, "Hopefully the standards
that the two national qualifying divers br~
ing will affect the rest of the divers. It's

nice to have an All-American (Klotz) back
from France."

As part of their training. both the men’s
and women’s teams will travel to Pueno
Rico for the second consecutive year for
winter training during the Christmas vaca-
tion. The team will train in the 50 meter
pool at the University of Puerto Rico for
nine days.

The team plans to hold various fund
raisers to offset the cost of the trip. A raf-
fle. swim-a~thon, and candy sales are the
events planned for this semester. All trips
are financed mostly by the swimmers.

Although the team has many outstan-
ding members, Turnage insists that it has-
the depth a team needs to win against
tough competition. None of the coaches
will predict what will happen, Turnage
said, “All in all. I think that we’ll do very
well." [I]
