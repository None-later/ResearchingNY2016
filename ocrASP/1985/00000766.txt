reaching effect of the Higher
Education Act, estimating that
about six million students use
some sort of financial aid and
that 80 percent of this comes from
the federal government.
NYPIRG is working to make
the Higher Education Act “more

the issue.” he said.

Davis said that the SUNYA
chapter of NYPIRG will be spon-
soring a forum on campus on the
topic of Higher Education to “let
students know the state of ﬁnan-

ment, according to Davis.

The topics to be addressed at
the forum will include the Higher
Education Act and possibly the
