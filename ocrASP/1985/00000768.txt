Degree of theft from UAS viewed as negligible

By Jim Avery
STAFF WRITER

It is a matter of degree when
you discuss theft from SUNYA’s
University Auxiliary Service run
cafeterias and also a matter of
who you talk to.

UAS operates nine cafeterias
on campus: one on each of the
four uptown quads, two on
Alumni Quad. the Patroon
Room, the Campus Center com-
muter cafeteria and the Kumquat
Lounge in Draper Hall.

"It‘s a little difﬁcult to iden-
tify." said Norbert Zahm,
General Manager of UAS. ex-
plaining, “We replace silverware
and dinnerware as needed." UAS
does not have a method to
distinguish breakage from theft in
its bookkeeping, he said.

Regarding the theft of food.
Zahm said, “I think it’s very
nominal. From a practical stand-
point, how are you going to take
out a pork chop?”

Lester Hynes, Director of Cam-
pus Center Cash Sales. said “We
have a pretty good nucleus of
students” adding, “I didn't think
we're giving them a reason to
steal. If you make it[UAS
priceslattractive to the pocket-
book as we do, they will stay
honest."

“Also, we move them pretty
quicklyIthrough cash register
linesland that's a key." said
Hynes.

However. the honesty of
students is seen quite differently
by some working within the
cafeterias. Ellie Willingham. the
Dutch Quad Dining Hall super-
visor. said of student theft, "It

happens far too often."

Willingham said she ﬁnds she
stops people most often at Satur-
day brunch, usually with sand-
wiches, fruit and cereal. “You
stop them and they get abusive,”
she said. “There’s a sign right
here saying they can’t take
anything out.” I

An off-campus student who
was enjoying a meal he did not
pay for said, “Stuff is taken all
the time. It goes on all the time."

Another student explained why
he takes food, saying, “Hey,
there's no food in my house right
now. This is it."

Zahm estimated an average of
$8,000 is spent in replacement of
utensils each year on each uptown
quad. “That‘s about $6 a person.
I don't know if that’s enough of
an expense to do what Maryland
did,” he said, referring to the
University of Maryland policy of
searching students as they leave
cafeterias. “The cost of keeping
track of all that would be more
than what we lose."

Roughly one-half of one per-
cent of UAS sales goes into
replacing stolen utensils. When
informed that Don Jacobs.
president-elect of the National
College and University Food Ser-
vices, said students normally steal
food and supplies worth between
three and seven percent of sales,
Zahm calculated seven percent of
UAS food sales to be $458,000.

“That would be seventy bucks
per student," said Zahm. “I
don’t know what they’re doing
down there but I don‘t see ram-
pant theft of food and tableware
here."

What we have is carelessness,
where they’ll empty a whole tray
with the silverware on it,” said
Hynes, who figured UAS loses
thirty dozen sets of stainless steel
and twenty dozen trays a year.

UAS generally keeps its costs

equal to the money taken from
meal plans and cash sales, said
Zahm. “We try to get the board
business to ﬁnance itself,” he
added. .
Seventy-ﬁve percent of all UAS
employees are students and at any

one time UAS employs 500
students, said Zahm, adding that
he does not remember on major
case of employee theft. “1 think
we’ve made clear to our people.
we will not tolerate theft. That’s
plain and simple,” he said. , El

   

COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE — For several weeks
last February, University of Maryland at College
Park students had to do more than bring their
trays up when they were finished eating at cam—
pus cafeterias. They also had to wait to be sear-
ched before they left.

It was all part of an attempt to stop a rash of
thefts from dining halls.

“We curtailed the stealing,” reported Mat-
thew Sheriff, director of food services at the Col-
lege Park campus, where students have lifted
about 15,000 glasses and 25,000 pieces of silver-
ware and stolen countless sandwiches since fall
term started.

“We wanted to make studens aware they
couldn’t take food out," he explained.

The way he did it. however, was to have cam-
pus ofﬁcials search students for food and utensils
as they left the cafeterias.

“It's an invasion of my personal privacy,"
first year student Steve Boardman told the
Diamondback, the student newspaper, after his
book bag was searched. “From what I know
about the law. I think it’s illegal.”

The searches may be on “shakey ground,"
agreed campus legal aid director William
Salmond.

Most colleges ﬁgure students will steal food
and supplies equivalent to three and seven per-
cent of sales, said Don Jacobs, president-elect of
the National Association of College and Univer-
sity Food Services.

Univ. Maryland students subjected to
searches to combat cafeteria pi lferage

records to monitor purchases and inventories.
Jacobs added.

At the University of Pennsylvania, where
Jacobs is dining services director, computerized
records help “students know that if they steal
something, we’ll find out about it pretty quick,”
Jacobs said.

But food and utensil theft is getting to be so
bad that schools nationwide are relying less on
student honor codes and more on stiff ﬁnes to
control it, he noted.

Jacobs quiestioned whether searches help,
however, saying they’re inconsistent with college
efforts to get students to behave like adults by
treating them as adults.

Maryland's Sheriff says the policy permitting
him to search students’ bagr and packages has
been “on the books” for ong time, but never
instituted until now.

Student Nancy Skinner thinks the issue is more
about food than knives and forks.

“(Sheriff) didn’t want people taking out sand-
wiches and apples” because “a percentage of
their profit is form people who pay for a meal
plan and don't eat.” Skinner said.

Also. last January, the University of Texas an-
nounced its food service was in debt because too
many students were actually using their campus
meal tickets. ‘

Sheriff said the problem at Maryland was that
the theft rate had increased.

He suspended the searches because the theft
problem is ‘ ‘now under control.’ ’
