foreign-born grad students out of

But all the effort ultimately
could‘ rob grad schOols of
students needed to keep their
enrollments up, make campuses
much les him and. interesting
places to be and even lead to a
teacher shortage in lower-level-
undergraduate courses, some
educators worry.

The foreignborn teaching
assistants themselves. moreover
fear the testing will cost them

their stipends, on which they de— .

pend to stay in the country.

The teaching stipend is “the
main income for us." explained
Chung Kuang Chao. president of
Arizona State's Chinese
(Taiwanese) '_ Students Associa-
tion. He said foreign students
have a very difficult time getting
other jobs off campus. ' ‘

AIDS guidelines

“We are aware of the problem
but as of today we haven't had
any set policy," she added.

The National 'Education
Association (NBA) has already
issued guidelines for dealing with
AIDS in public elementary and
high schools. The NBA guidelines
are recommended for all schools
in the United States and will pro-
bably establish the trend for deal-
ing with AIDS victims in schools.

Chair Stanley Williams, who says

Testing foreign students’
English skills before they're ad-

mitted to grad school, however,-

could depress enrollment. “It will
be tougher in the future for

(foreign) students to come to

USC" if new English competency

guidelines is to “consider each
particular case on'a case by case
basis» for students, teachers and
school employees." said Howard
Carroll, a member of the NEA
communications department.
According to the NEA

guidelines, if it is determined that

an infect person poses *a greater
than normal risk of transmitting
AIDS, such persons should be ex-
cluded from the school setting.

tests are adopted, Baker asserted.

Discourageing foreign students
from coming to the U.S. con-
ceivably could have a devastating

‘-impact on many American grad
schools. where foreign students

make up about a third of the stu-

dent body.

And because starting salaries
for bachelor.degrees in engineer-
ing and computer science have
been so high, native students who
in other decades would go on to
grad school are instead taking
jobs in private industry.

Consequently, science and
technical grad schols often recruit
foreign students aggressively in
order to keep their departments
full.

More than 50 percent of the
students enrolled in graduate
science and technical school pro-
grams this year are foreign born,
according to a recent article in the
Wall Street Journai.l

to remain in the school setting is
to be made by a team consisting
of public health personnel, the in-
fected person’s physician, ap-
propriate school personnel, and
the family of the victim.

The decision should be based
on the victim’s physical condi-
tion, expected type of interaction
with others, and the impact on
the infected person and others in
the setting."

The NEA guidelines recom-
mend that a school employer may

Keeping those students from
teaching, moreover, could cause a
teacher shortage in some lower-
level undergraduate courses.

“We really had to scratch (to
come up with enough instructors)
this semester,” reproted Ben
Huey, acting chair of Arizona
State’s Computer Science School.

But at least 20 of the 28 grad
students who had to take an oral
English competency test did well
enough to get at least partial cer-
tification, Huey noted.

The others are taking remedial
English courses in hopes they’ll
qualify to teach next semester.
ASU also is trying to get them
research projects so they won’t
lose their stipends.

“There are many other jobs
they can do," added Madelyn
Lockhart. dean of Florida’s grad
school, which recently adopted,
new English skill standards for
teaching.

require persons suspected of hav-
ing AIDS to have a medical
evaluation. The report states,
however. “the sexual orientation
of a student of school employee
shall not constitute reasonable
cause to believe that he or she is
an infected individual.”

The final recommendation in
the NEA Report states that once
it is determined that an infected
person is permitted to remain in
the school setting, his or her iden-
tity will not be publically
revealed.

The guidelines were drawn up
because of evidence the disease
might be spreading, said Carroll.
adding that the NEA hoped to
prevent panic. “We want to get it
on the drawing board when and if
it hits." he said.

Haffner said he hopes the
SUNY. guidelines will hep in
dispelling fear and confusion
about the spread of AIDS, but he
added, “The best defense and
sensible approach is self informa-
tion, to become aware of the facts
surround AIDS and to increase
understanding of AIDS."

Haffner has made available to

“We have strains on our pro—
gram. but that (not enough grad
students to teach) is not the
reason," Lockhard said.
“Without sufﬁcient funds, we
can’t hire enough TA’s. We are
not unusual in that respect."

“The supply of TAs is there,
concurred Philip Holden, presi-
dent of Graduate Assistants
United, a union for teaching
assistants.

But students and campuses in
general lose something by limiting
the number of foreign grad
students. who can teach, South
Cal’s Baker observed.

“Undergraduate studetns tend
to be parochial,” she said. “They
tend not to be well exposed to
foreighners. Part of it is
educating U.S. student 5 that ac-
cents are different. It’s a much
more exciting place with interna-
tional students." Ea

SUNY campuses two pamphlets
concerning the disease. “AIDS-
What All Students Should
Know" was released by the
American College Health Assoca.
tion and “one Hundred and One
Questions and Answers," which
was released by the New York
State Department of Health.

On the SUNYA campus, Neil
Brown, Assocatc Vice President
for Health and Counseling Ser-
vices. said he has ordered several
thousand of the American Col-
lege Health Association pam-
phlets. He stressed the pamphlet
was important for all students to
read and said it provides the
straight forward information
about AIDS.

Brown said the SUNYA Health
Services will help any student who
has or believes they might have
AIDS. “I think we are current in
terms of dealing medically and
supportiver with an AIDS case,"
he said.

“We certainly aren’t backing
away or skirting the issue of dealt!
ing with a person who has AIDS
or desires referral for testing,”
said Brown.
