Bombers sentenced

Auckland, New Zealand
(AP) The nation’s highest judge sentenced
two French secret agents to 10 years in
prison Friday for manslaughter in the
bombing of the Greenpeace flagship,
Rainbow Warrior. He said the punish-
ment was meant to deter terrorism.

Maj. Alain Nafrart, 35. and Capt.
Dominique Prieur, 36, also received seven
years each for willful damage to the ship,
which was blown up and sunk in
Auckland Harbor on July 10.

"The courts must make it plain that
persons coming into this country cannot
expect a short holiday at the expense of
the government and return home as
heroes.” said Sir Roland Davison. chief
justice of the Auckland High Court.

The Rainbow Warrior was sunk by
mines and a Greenpeace photographer,
Fernando Pereira of the Netherlands, was
killed in the blast. Greenpeace had sent
the ship to New Zealand to lead a protest
ﬂotilla against French nuclear tests in the
Muroroa Atoll in the South Pacific.

last week.

Juan Castillo, a spokesman for Presi-
dent Balisario Betancur, said that, as of
Wednesday, an estimated 27,000 people
had died in the Nov. 13 disaster. and
8.000-9.000 of them were under 16. But
Health Minister Rafael Zubiria said earlier
this week the figure was 25,000 and has
not updated it since.

Mayor Joel Hartman of Mariquita. ap-
parently the only town involved in the
evacuation drill Wednesday night, said the
order to leave the town and march into the
hills came only hours after 15,000 people
had just returned to the town after ﬂeeing
in fear of another eruption and mud
avalanche.

“Now they have returned to the moun-
tains (again) and many refuse to return (to
Mariquita)," Hartman said.

Mandela may be freed

Johannesburg, South Africa
(AP) Winnie Mandela said Thursday that
the government had approved the request
of her jailed husband to see his lawyers,
and rumors persisted that authorities were
about to free the prominent black leader.
‘ Mrs. Mandela said in Cape Town that
she took the speculation seriously because
of its “unprecedented intensity.”

“if it was true, l would be overjoyed,"
she told reporters. President P.W. Botha’s
office ﬁrst said that “no decision has been
taken" on releasing Mandela, then issued
a statement denying his release was immi-
nent. “There is no truth in the rumors,”

 

the statement said.

Botha offered last summer to release
Mandela from prison if he renounced
violence, but Mandela refused. Mandela.
67, former head of the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement, is
recovering in a Cape Town hospital from
a prostate gland operation on Nov. 3.

Kate rips Florida

Panama City, Florida
(AP) Hurricane Kate charged ashore in
the Florida Panhandle with 100 mile per
hour winds Thursday, the first November
hurricane to make landfall in half a cen-
tury, as more than 100,000 people tied for
the fourth time in as many months.

The hurricane spawned tornadoes that
ripped the roofs off buildings and tore
down power lines in the towns of Port St.
Joe and Mexico Beach. Roads were block-
ed by flood waters or toppled trees, and
emergency officials warned residents to
stay put in evacuation shelters for the
night.

Kate's eye, which was 20 miles in
diameter. hit land at 5 p.m., said Dr. Neil
Frank, Director of the National Hurricane
Center in Coral Gables.

Tornadoes also touched down in
Panama City and in neighboring Calhoun
County, tearing down power lines and
trees. High winds ripped part of the roof
off a school being used as a shelter in
nearby Callaway, but no injuries were
reported.

SUNY books scorned

 
 

Albany
(AP) — The State University of New York
College of Technology in Utica is plagued
by business ofﬁce management problems
that exist at SUNY campuses throughout
the state, State Comptroller Edward
Regan charges.

Regan released an audit of the Utica
Campus Thursday and said that “a distur-
bing pattern is emerging” in audits of
SUNY business ofﬁces.

“Time and again, NY auditors find
evidence that business office supervisors
arbitrarily adjust bookeeping entries -—
frequently by thousands of dollars —-
because it is the only way they can get stu-
dent billing accounts to balance." Regan
said.

NYC fire traps 40

New York
(AP) — An estimated 40 people were trap-

45-story building in midtown Manhattan,

witnesses said. No injuries were reported.

The fire was reported at 7 p.m. at the
Tower 49 Building, 12 East 49 Street. just
off Fifth Avenue next to the Swedish Con-
sulate, according to ﬁreﬁghter Henry
Nugent. a fire department spokesman.

“When we first got here, there were peo-

said John Timoney, a police spokesman.

Witnesses said the fire began on the va-

By David Spaldlng
STAFF WRITER

SUNYA’s Student Association and the

, Student Assodation of the State Universi-

ty (SASU) have teamed up to lobby Con-
gress for the passage of the Civil Right
Restoration Act of 1985.

Petition drives will be conducted by the
groups on quad dinner lines November
24-26 to increase student awareness on the
issue, said Camille Danzi, Assistant Coor-
dinator for Women's lssues for SA’s
Minority Affairs Ofﬁce.

An extensive poster campaign is also be-
ing planned and Resident Assistants will
be asked to inform their sections about the
issue, she said.

The 1985 Restoration Act has been held
up in two House of Representatives sub-
committees by pro-life lobbyists who want
anti-abortion riders attached to the
amendment.

The riders would allow discrimination
against women students and faculty
members who have had abortions. It
would also allow college administrators to
remove abortion coverage from school-
sponsored health insurance, said SA
Minority Affairs Coordinator Paco
Duarte.

The Restoration Act is intended to re-

Alyson Reed, 3 SASU Women's Caucus
intern participating said in the statewide
SASU campaign to lobby for the
Reauthorization Act.

“it’s important that the original intent
of the Civil Rights Act is interpreted as it
was originally meant to be. A narrow in-
terpretation of this legislation could set
narrow rc-interpretations of other civil
rights acts,” said Danzi.

Duarte said, “if you allow something
like this (the Anti—abortion riders) to go,
you start a bad precedent. in the future
you could see more legislation that restricts
women's rights."

According to Duane, if the anti-
abortion riders are passed, health services
for college women would be hurt. if this
form of discrimination were to happen,
birth control and gynecological services
might be the next step to go, said Duane.

Health care, dorms top student complaint list

By Colleen Desiaurler
srxrr warren

Students at a one hour public hearing during Tuesday's
State University Board of Trustees meeting complained
about the self-sufficiency of dormitories, quality of
health care services, and the public hearings themselves.

Only four of the nine appointed trustees attended the
hearing, which was held after a meeting that all trustees
were present for. including moderator Edgar A. Sand-
man, trustees present were Judy L. Duken, Van Johnson,
and Darwin R. Wales.

The Board’s policy of increasing dorm rents to cover all
costs of student. on-campus housing drew ﬁre from
Eileen Dyller, a SUNY Binghamton student.

She said it is likely to increase rents off-campus, and
violates a tenant’s right to a lease.

First year students ordered to live on campus are most
strongly affected, she said. “if we are in a situation where
a campus has that kind of power, then students need the
power of any other tenant.”

Dyller said, “1 hate to think that a campus such as
Stony Brook, which is an expensive community. where
moving off campus is next to impossible, is going to suf-
fer so that students up north can beneﬁt. That’s not the
goal of SUNY."

Allison Reed of Binghamton complained about the

quality of campus health service. “The trustees need to
establish some form of minimum requirement to regulate
and insure adequate health care facilities on each SUNY
campus. This problem becomes a basic health issue," she
said.

“SUNY has a special responsibiity to provide adequate
care for the students they recruit to attend the universi-
ty,” Reed said. “The state has a social responsibility to
provide the university a chartei' with the proper amount
of funds to ensure this.”

“if we are ever to truly improve the quality of student
life. the provision of basic health care services as an issue
must be reversed." she said.

Debbie Meisel of Binghamton spoke out against the
public hearings. “1 feel they are not accessible but exclu—
sionary because of the times and places in which they oc-
cur." She told the trustees, “evidence that student par-
ticipation is not encouraged is obvious from the inade-
quate publicity of the hearing."

Meisel complained that many of the hearings are
scheduled during or extremely close to students’ vaca—
tions, mid-terms, or ﬁnal examinations. She cited the
hearings of November 29, 1984 - held during Thanksgiv-
ing: May 8, 1984 and December 9. 1983 - both held during
ﬁnals week; and April 23, 1982 - held during spring
recess.

Because many students do not have time to travel to far
away places, the sites of these hearings are also an impor-
tant issue, she said. “if more of the open hearings were
held . . . at convenient locations, 1 feel certain that more
students would attend."

Only about 10 people attended the hearing.

Meisel also objected to the trustees’ poor attendance at
the hearing. “it started out that there were ten trustees
this morning. 1 strongly ask you [the trustees] to urge
your colleagues not to leave the next time there's an open
hearing.”

in response to the complaints, Dr. Jerome Komisar
Executive Vice Chancellor. said each student “touched
upon a topic that had come up before the board and is of
interest to the board.

He said the trustees are examining dorm problems, and
their main concern is to ﬁnd a solution that would “best
allow the university to maintain the lowest possible cost. "

Komisar said the problem of adequate health care
facilities, particularly during the time of ﬁnancial stress,
is a topic the board has also taken an interest in. “The
question became one of not the provision of services by
the state university necessarily. but the availability of ser-
vices to the students at all the locations." [:1

UAS offers coffee as campus alcohol substitute

 

 

By Leslie Chait
srxrr warren

Students showed that they could learn to
love coffee as much as alcohol when an at-
tempt by Student Association and Univer-
sity Auxilliary Services to provide a social
alternative to drinking through a new cof-
fee bar proved successful.

“1 Love Coffee Week," held November
18 to 21 in the Rathskcllar, provided
students with the opportunity to taste
various types of brewed coffee and also the
chance to win a free trip to Fort Lauder-
dale over Spring Break.

Lester Hynes. Director of Cash Sales,
said that a little over a year ago, in the ad-
vent of the 21 drinking age. there was a
need for a way for students to socialize
without alcohol.

Last November, there was a one-day
Coffee Day in the Rat. where about
i,200-1,300 students came and sampled
the SUNY blend coffee. a mixture of Mex-
ican Alturus and Brazilian Santos Beans. it
was “very well received," said Hynes.

Alcoholic beverages will still be served at
the Rat after December 1. when the drink-
ing age is raised, but “because the majorl-

ty of students on campus won't be able to
drink, we are coming up with alternatives.
There will be many changes at the Rat,"
said Betty Ginzburg, SA Director of Stu-
dent Programming.

“We want an area where students can
come down and have a place to socialize,"
said Hynes, adding that there is “full sup-
port for the coffee bar. 1’" be very happy
to see so many students come down and
socialize and to try the coffees. That's
what’s it all about —- students socializing
and programming without alcohol."

A contest to come up with the best name
for the coffee bar ,was also held this week
and the winner will receive the Fort
Lauderdale trip.

“The free trip is an interest sparker,"
said Ginzburg, adding it is an "entirely
promotional idea." Getting students in-
volved in the naming of the coffee bar is a
“way to spark enthusiasm," she said.

Hynes said the naming of the bar would
help there be an identification with the
area. Cakes will be served along with the
coffee. and there is the possibility that it
could expand into a gourmet shop. he
added.

iced capuccino and espresso were in-
troduced during July. “it was very suc-
cessful and it continued," said Hynes.

Ginzburg said the iced coffees have been
“selling very. very well." adding that there
will be “enough support for a full coffee
bar" because “at the coffee bar, there
won’t be just one kind of coffee. There
will be a great variety of coffees being
sold. UAS put a lot of time into this and
feels it will be a success."

Hynes said that some of the types of cof-I

fee to be sold are Mocha Java. SUNY
Blend, a combination of Mexican Altura
and Brazilian Santos beans, and Swiss
Chocolate Almond.

SA did not contribute any money
toward the coffee bar. though they did
help out considerably. installation of the
equipment for the coffee bar was funded
by the Coffee Development Group and
University Auxilliary Services will pay a
nominal yearly rental fee for the equip-
ment. said Hynes.

UAS contributed approximately
“534.000 in remodeling the area and for
the promotion." said Hynes.
