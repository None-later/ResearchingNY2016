Undergrad colloquiumspeaksout on language

By Bette Dzamba
EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

The ﬁrst undergraduate colloquium ever
to be held at this university was presented
Tuesday by students in the Linguistics
department.

About 25 people attended the collo-
quium, which was held in the Humanities
Lounge. .

Lisa Feerick. one of the organizers of
the event, said that the idea of the collo-
quium arose from a group of students
representing departments such as
Linguistics, Spanish, and Anthropology.
“It was a broad group to talk about
language,” she said.

“The colloquium is the first
undergraduate research forum," said
Feerick.

The first speaker, Anne-Marie Maestri,
delivered a paper entitled “Several Dif—

fercnces in Descriptive Color Naming."
Maestri conducted the research for her
paper on 20 subjects. Half of the subjects
were male and the other half were female.
The subjects were asked to describe a pic-
ture of the character Opus from the comic
strip “Bloom County."

Maestri found that “women make more
precise determinations in naming colors
than do men." The 10 women named 221
color names to the men’s 151. Nine men,
as opposed to only two women. needed to
be prompted to include colors in their
descriptions.

Maestri noted that men “tended to be
more geometric in their descriptions. They
spoke of the shapes present rather than the
colors."

One male subject said, “I think in terms
of lines, shapes, and angles. Not in color."

Maestri said that women focused on the

physical aspects of Opus, particularly his
nose. Men tended to describe the penguin's
emotional state.

The second speaker, Diane Lang.
delivered her review paper of Susan F.
Schmerling’s “Subjectless Sentences and
the Notion of Surface Structure."

Lang noted that sentences which are in-
tended for spoken English only do not
need to have a subiect.

She said “‘Tastes like almonds’,‘Smells
like apple pie’, and ‘Feels like silk’.” were
examples of subjectless sentences. “in
these \sentences, there is little ambiguity.
The subject is obvious," said Lang.

Lang added, “sentences with perception
verbs lend themselves to being subjectives
while those with the verb ‘to be” such as
‘Am a doctor’ do not."

The third speaker. Matthew Feeney,
spoke about the jargon used in
Mathematics. “The purpose of my study
was to observe mathematical lexicon items
used in College Algebra. Did they serve a
real purpose or were they merely exclu-
sionary?" said Feeney.

Feeney concluded that terms such as
“Natural log of A". “negative power",
and “polynomial” were not pretentious
but necessary. “The standard lexicon
would not express the ideas of
mathematics," he said.

“is it because we have to use special lex-
ical items that people are afraid of math?”
questioned Feeney.

TheIfinal speakers, Andrea Karsch and
Michael Shikora. spoke on “The Syntax
and Semantics of Adjectives with ‘it' Sub-
jects and lnfinitival Complements in
English.”

in their talk they distinguished between
three types of adjectives based on their use
in a sentence.

“it was important for students to be
able to practice delivering papers in front
of their peers and faculty members that
they knew," said Feerick.

“1 think it was very successful," she
said. “I hope it will serve as a model for
students arid that other departments will
follow suit,” added Feerick.

According to Feerick. “We will carry on
as long as there are other students to
follow through. We already have submis-
sions for next semester. There is plenty of
untapped research around."

Frank commented, “it was very good. i
found it interesting to hear the papers. The
students did a really good job of writing up
papers for delivery.”

“it was really exciting for studiuts to
take initiative. 1 found that heartening."
said Frank. E]

W‘asserman-Winsﬁcechair post

By Angelina Wang
STAFF/HER

Following last week’s
resignation .of Vice Chair Liz
Chestnut. Central Council held
an election Wednesday night to
fill the position. '

Antotai of four ballots was
needed before Council reached
the mandatory two-thirds concen-
sus and elected Larry Wasserman
as the new Vice Chair. '

Because Of Council’s difﬁculty
in reaching a consensus. Wasser-
man and the other nominees,
Michael]. Herman and Wally
Roberts, 'were asked a series of
questions about their candidacy.

Phil Botwinick. State Quad
representative. asked “What kind

of committment (the nominees) I

were willing to give?"

“1 would like to devote most of
my time to student government,"
said Wasserman. Headded that
even if he had responsibilities to
another group he would forego
them for his position in student
government. “1 do want to get in-
volved and I do care,” he said.

“I will give 110 percent effort,
be there when people have a ques-
tion, and let people know exactly
what's going on in Central Coun-
cil,” said Roberts.

“My committment to this in-
stitution can be seen by my
change in feelings towards SA,"
said Bennan. He explained his,
apathy a year ago and how he

would like to_ see more involve-.

ment among IStudents. “That's
the motivation that I bring to the
job," he said.

Lynn Livanos, Colonial Quad
representative, asked the
nominees, “What do you see as
the position of Vice Chair and
.what are your qualifications?"

Barman said, “To assist Bill
(McCann) with bookkeeping and
clerical work. 1 know I have to let
the job grow."

Wasserman vieWed the Vice
Chair 'as a liaison between the
Chair and the committees (of
Central Council). “The Vice
Chair is an overseer of these com-
mittees as well as an advisor to the
chair." he said. He also mentined
he has overseen committees asIa
fraternity leader.

Roberts saw the ability to in-
teract with other people impor-
tant in a Vice Chair. “i can get
along very well with them, and
1’ve been very involved in Central
Council." He said his activities in
University Action for the Disabl—
ed was “practical experience of
getting people organized to fight
for what they believe in."

When ,the second ballot still
gave no winner, Council Chair
Bill McCann gave his expecta-
tions of the position of Vice
Chair. He said the person should
have a working relationship with
the Chair. “Vice Chair is a posi-
tion that can really expand," he
said.

Chestnut said she resigned
because of the many hours a week
required of her as Finance Com-
mittee Chair and because of the
long weekly Central Council
meetings.

"i wasn't getting anything out
of it anymore. and I hoped that
by stepping aside, someone else

Central Council meeting last Wednesday
It took four ballots to elect a new vice—chair

would get a chance." she said. “It
wasa hard decision for me to
make."

Steven Russo, Internal Affairs
Chair, asked Wasserman if he
saw any difficulties being Vice
Chair since he also replaced
Chestnut as Finance Committee
Chair. “1 don’t see it as a pro-
blem. I don't make decisons
hastily and I do have the time."

said Wasserman.

After the third ballot resulted
in still not enough votes, Michael
Barman decided to fold his
candidacy.

Wasserman thanked Central
Council for electing him after the
fourth ballot made him Vice
Chair. When asked, Roberts and
Berman both agreed Wasserman
will make a capable Vice Chair. El
