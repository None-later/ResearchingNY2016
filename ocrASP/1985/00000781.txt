New, experienced female barber attracts

more women clientele for university shop

By Pam Conway
ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR

The University Barber Shop
has been on campus for I9 years
but its first female operator, Sue
Martin, was just hired only two
months ago.

Working at the shop has been a

good experience
'for Martin. “So 
Profile

far," she said,
“I like it very
much. The ten
weeks I’ve been
here have gone by really fast."

Before coming to SUNYA,
Martin worked in various salons.
She said that being at a University
is “very interesting. There are
people here from all the world
and I like that.”

The Barber Shop has had a
mostly male clientele in the past,
but since Martin’s arrival, “we’ve
been getting more girls,” she said,
adding that “I think most girls
aren't aware that we do both
[men’s and women’s hair]."

As for the students who visit
her at the shop, Martin said that
“I had wondered about them
before I came here but they are
very friendly and down-to—earth.
I am also learning a lot of new
hairstyles."

Martin comes to SUNYA with
considerable experience. She has
a license from both a barber
school and a beauticial school,
and has worked at the Turnpike
Barber Shop. “I still work there
on Saturdays," she said.

Although licensed to do other
things than just haircuts, Martin
said that perms and sets cannot be
done at the Barber Shop because
“you need a separate area for
that. You also need ventilation
and we don‘t have those
facilities."

The decision to hire a woman
was made partially to appeal to
the needs of both sexes on cam-

pus, said Martin. “We can offer
more services to more people if
we have a man and a woman
working," she said.

Martin’s co-worker is Dan Gat-
to, manager of the Barber Shop,
who has been working there since
its establishment 19 years ago.

Gatto said that so far Martin
has been a “very good operator.
She really loves her work. I think
she is more happy working than
when she is not."

According to Gatto, business
has improved over the past year.
“Between October 1984 and Oc-
tober 1985 business has improved
and that's a good sign," he said.

“We always had some female
customers," said Gatto, “and
they go to Sue now. Because of

that we have picked up more
because they' have sent their
girlfriends."

“We had three male operators
and l was pleased to some extent:
but since the last one left I
thought it was a good time to hire
a woman," said Gatto.

The decision to hire a female
operator, said Gatto, was to “at-
tract more female students and
also to compare styling
techniques."

The University Barber Shop is
located in the tunnel underneath
the Social Sciences building and is
open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Mon-
day through Friday. Hair cuts
begin at $5 and go as high as
$8.50. D

'Star‘Wars’ and the Reagan-
Gorbachev summit will have great
effects on future relations bet-
ween the superpowers. according
to Dr. Peter Stein, a physicist at
Cornell University.

The most important thing that

the summit could bring about is
that “they [the superpowers] have
to exhibit self-control to keep the
other 200 some countries from ac-
quiring nuclear power," Stein
said.
“The real problem is that no
one ever forgets how to build a
nuclear weapon . . . the number
of countries with nuclear weapons
will not go down,” Stein said.

The important thing is to keep
countries that do not already
possess nuclear technology from
gaining it, Stein said. The major
threat now comes from unstable
countries, such as Liberia, who
have access to nuclear weapons,
he said.

While the Soviets possess more
than three times the amount of
nuclear arms needed to destroy
the United States, they would
probably not risk a nuclear attack
on the United States at this time,
said Stein. However, 20 years
down the road the Soviets may
not be stable or rational, he said.

‘Star Wars’ however, is not a
viable defense system for. the
united States, said Stein.

The logic of the supporters of '

‘Star Wars' is that “once we show
that we can destroy 90 percent of
their missiles, they will destroy 90
percent of their missiles," said
Stein. This logic is exactly con-
trary to what would actually hap-
pen, arms escalation instead of
limitation would occur, he said.
President Reagan’s plan for
nuclear defense consists of three
parts: terminal defense, mid-
course defense, and boost phase
defense. The missile is in its boost

phase for just about three minutes
while it gains the speed to leave
the earth’s atmosphere. “The
whole thing rises or falls on a
boost phase defense,” said Stein.

The boost phase is the best time
to destroy the missile because of
it’s slow velocity and because all
warheads are contained in the

'rocket which is a large and

delicate target. “The missile in
the boost stage has all its eggs in
one basket,” he said.

of these are very effective, Stein
said, but, he added that the logic
was that none of the defenses
could work on their own. It’s
hoped that together they might be
effective, he said.

The terminal phase of the in-
coming warheads is the phase just
before they explode. Scientists
have argued that a defense at this
stage could be effective in protec-
ting our missiles, but not our
cities, Stein said. A terminal

“No one ever forgets how to build
a nuclear weapon. ”

—Dr. Peter Stein

 

The problem, however, is that
during this phase, the missile
would still be in Russian territory,
he said. The idea behind: ‘Star
Wars‘ would be to put satellites in
orbit such that there would
always be a satellite over Russia,
“but instead of HBO [Home Box
Ofﬁce), we put lasers in them,"

.said Stein.

The problem with this plan is
that we would have to put 300—400
satellites in orbit, and the enemy
would only have to disable one in
order to put a hole in the shield,
said Stein. The satellites would be
sitting ducks, he said. “It would
be easier to shoot down the SDI
[‘Star Wars’ satellites] than it is to
have the space shields shoot down
the missiles.“

/Even if the US. was able to
build this system, the Soviets are
only three years behind,
technologically, and will be work-
ing on ways to get through the
system concurrently with this
country’s development of the
system, said Stein. The French are
already working on it. he said.

The entire defense plan also in-
cludes a terminal phase defense
and a midcourse defense. Neither

defense could deal with about 100
missiles, but not a whole attack,
he said.

There are also a number of pro-
blems with the midcourse phase
defense, said Stein. First. the
missiles would be moving at
“something like 15-20,000 miles
per hour, and will have (frac-
tionated),”'or separated, into its
separate warheads. he said.

The other major problem with
defense in this phase is that dum-
my missiles made of mylar can be
sent up along with the real ones,
which would be totally in-
distinguishable from the real
missiles in outer space.

There are other ways. to deliver
nuclear warheads besides lCBM's
[inter-continental ballistic
missiles), such as the cruise
missile. which the Soviets could
launch very close to our borders it'
they felt they had to, said Stein.

Robert L. Hoffman, the
namesake of the lecture series,
was a professor at SUNYA who
died last year. He was dedicated
to the pursuit of peace and the
Hoffman Memorial Fund for
Peace was set up in his honor. [I]
