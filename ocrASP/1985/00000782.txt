Feedback, columns sought
from all SUNYA minorities

By E. Paul Stewart
MINORITY AFFAIRS EDITOR

During the past several weeks I have
been getting some feedback about this col-
umn. .The “reviews” have been mixed;
some people think my approach is “too
strong,” others believe it is “too soft" and
lacks punch. I welcome all the constructive
criticism because there's

always room for 
improvement. 

My writing is a special
part of me and what I at- M
tempt to do is stir your
mind. Sometimes I hope you'll nod in
agreement but I’m still very glad when you
get upset. If 1 were pleasing everybody all
the time, that would indicate to me that
I'm doing something wrong!

Unfortunately. outside of the ASP staf f ,
I receive no feedback from the white ma-
jority. Hopefully this indicates that they
just have nothing to say and not that
they're not interested. (Or perhaps another
case of foolish optimism on my part.)

Nevertheless, I shall continue to write. I
believe my articles are as strong as possi-
ble, within the limits of space. I do can-
cede that I do attempt to employ tact in my
writing, as I do in my everyday life. Please

The Coffee Development Group (CDG),
a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit
organization. is funded through coffee
producing nations to promote coffee pro-
ducts. CDG tests the grinds to see that they
taste alright. It sees that we “get a better
cup of coffee," said Hynes.

Robin Goldhaber. a sophomore, said,
“I think it’s a great idea. It’s good that
there will still be alcohol for those over 21,
but having the coffee bar makes the Rat
more open to others. It should have been

don’t confuse my tactfulness, with

passivism or conformism.

Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay
“Self~Reliance" stated “Whose would be
a man, must be a nonconformist." In
many respects I have lived by “this and

But again, I might slip up on occassion, so
you, the reader should let me know.

Since my title is “Minority Affairs
Editor" and not columnist, I can solicit
guest writers. I encourage any minority
group leader or member to send me articles
and whenever possible they will be printed.
This is not “my column" - it’s “our
column!"

If we as a group fail to utilize this space
to voice our concerns and address the
issues. as well as raise new ones, we will be
doing ourselves a grave disservice.

As the history of this country would in-
dicate, whenever something is there and we
don't “hop on it,” it somehow manages to
fade away, without our noticing it until it
is too late.

So I’m asking you to open your mouths,
pick up your pens, and take some action.
Don‘t allow this golden opportunity to
fade to black. I car ’t do it all, so let’s do it

Ben Lido, a senior, said, “The Rat is
trying to trade one addiction for another -
from alcohol to caffeine. In light of recent
research by the Cancer Research Center,
three or more coffees a day increase cor
onary ailments by three times. I question if
this trade off is better for your health."

Amy Levinson, also a senior. said, “I
think it’s really cool. It's about time the
Rat did something like this.

Campus smoking areas considered sufficient

By Rene Bablch
STAFF warm

Although many new anti-
smoking regulations have been
implemented by local govern-
ments across the country,
students and faculty at SUNYA
seem to believe that current
university ‘restrictions are
sufficient. -

Areas on campus that permit
smoking in certain areas include
the commuter cafeteria in the
Campus Center and the basement
of the library. The separation of
smoking and non-smoking sec-
tions in these places, according to
many people who frequent them,
is successful and fair.

Smokers and non-smokers
alike seem to agree that there are
not many places in which smok-
ing is allowed, and that those
areas in which it is permitted have
provided the most agreeable
alternatives.

“Smoking in the Camp‘rs
Center doesn't really bother me
because it’s an open enough
area," said student Dana
Bacman.

“It' in more enclosed areas
like bars that it ahnoys‘me," she
said, adding that “there aren't
really that many places on cam‘
pus that you‘re allowed to
smoke.”

University regulations have
designated classrooms, most of

the academic buildings on cam-
pus, and most bathrooms as non-
smoking areas. But some people
claim the restrictions are often
ignored. '

“I think there should be more
restrictions,” said Luana Noto, a
secretary in the Political Science
department. "People don't really
pay attention to the ones there
are; students still smoke in the
halls," she said. ‘

more of cooperation, rather than
tougher or less severe restrictions.

“Understanding and considera-
tion on both sides would best help
the situation," said student
Elinor Brook. “People who don‘t
want to be exposed to smoke
shouldn’t have to be, but some
people are fighting more for the
principle and less for the fact,”
said Brook, who is a smoker.

A secretary in the Geology

part people adhere to the mics,
and that no more restrictions
should be required. As a non-
smoker, she said that “as long as
we have a choice and smoking is
not forced on me it’s okay. But
when people come into the ofﬁce
smoking, it really annoys me,"
she said.

Some people don‘t agree that
the university has enough regula-

and a non-smoker, said there
should be more restricted areas,
such as "half of the commuter
cafeteria. rather than just the
edges. If someone two tables
away from me lights up a
cigarette and I get a ‘woof’ of
smoke in my face, it really
obstructs my thinking when I’m
trying to study,” he said.

Smoking policies an issue nationwide

College Park, Md.

COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE — The chancellor’s signature is all that is
needed for the University of Maryland to implement one of the
most drastic smoking policies of‘ any college campus.

Joseph Gilmour, Chancellor John B. Slaughter’s top assistant,
said Slaughter fully supports the tough new restrictions.

‘ The policy would ban smoking in classrooms, lecture halls,
libraries, hallways, a third of the campus's dining halls and lounges
and any office in which any nonsmoker objects to smoking.

While Maryland’s measure, initiated by the faculty-dominated
Campus Senate, may be extreme, it’s hardly groundbreaking.

Already, hundreds of schools have enacted smoking policies,
sometimes in response to new state laws curbing smoking in
government institutions, restaurants, public areas, and in some
cases, private businesses.

Florida State University system, for example, is hurrying to
comply with a June law prohibiting smoking in public places.

Pacific Lutheran, Southern California and Stanford, among
others, must comply with local city or county smoking ordinances.

In all, 35 states and some counties have enacted smoking legisla-
tion affecting college campuses. according to the National Lung
Association.

But the Maryland Faculty wasn’t responding to any higher law
when it began discussing its own smoking ban, points out Student
Government Association President Kim Rice.

Instead, faculty members werearoused by the Surgeon General's

1984 report citing the harmful effects of smoke on nonsmokers.

While’Rice admitted “students here favor some sort of policy,"
she said some did object because it had been instigated by faculty,
but would primarily effect students.

Because Maryland students “are in favor of some sort of
policy." Rice and other SGA members passed a resolution soften-
ing the Senate's measure, permitting smoking in some designated
areas.

“They (the Campus Senate) didn't recognize that students must
be able to smoke somewhere indoors during the day," said Rice.
“Students shouldn’t have to go outside, especially in the winter, if
they want to have a cigarette.”

Slaughter currently is studying both the Campus Senate and the
SGA resolutions, Gilmour said. Once the school’s legal department
finishes reviewing plans for enforcement, the chancellor will sign
one of the measures, or a combination of the two.

Historically, campus legislation rarer is received favorably by
faculty, students and administrators alike, but when it comes to
smoking, campuses nationwide seem to be in concurrence

Stanford, for example, reports “across the board compliance"
with its January, 1985 ban on smoking in any open environment.
Presidential assistant Marlene Wine attributes such cooperation to
Stanford’s high percentage -—— between 80 and 90 percent —- of
nonsmokers.

Associated Students member Leslie Leland said the measure
“simply hasn’t had that much effect because hardly anybody
smoked anyway."
