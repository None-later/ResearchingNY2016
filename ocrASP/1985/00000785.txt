Kennedy cautions hopeful writers
about perils in publishing industry

By Jim Avery
STAFF WRITER

“I think the odds are against the writer
in a way they didn't used to be,” said
Pulitzer Prize Winning Author William
Kennedy Tuesday afternoon in the second
’of his four part “Dialogue with Students."

Proﬁt margins have become a major
problem for writers today as publishing
becomes increasingly more of a business.
“Is it a crap game? it is and it isn’t,” Ken-
nedy said. “They [the publishers] want to
make the most money they can from the
smallest expense."

“The big chain book stores have grown
powerful.” said Kennedy, adding that
“publishers tailor what they think Dalton
or Walden will buy."

After being introduced by Harry C.
Staley of the SUNYA English department,
Kennedy read a prepared statement and

ing Arts Center’s Recital Hall.

“it is easier for a ﬁrst-time novelist to
get published for the first time than it is for
the novelist with his fourth or fifth novel
and a lousy track record," said Kennedy.

Also, Kennedy said short story writers
are finding an audience. “The short story
has had a rennaissance. A whole new crop
of short story writers have been
appearing.”

Another aspect of modern publishing
Kennedy covered was the growth of
regional publishing, as many young writers
search for a forum in which they can ap~
pear in print. He also said he sees large
magazines. such as The New Yorker

I devoting more space to fiction.

He cautioned young writers against
firms who charge reading fees claiming
that they were not really in the business of
being agents, but in the business of charg-

then fielded questions from an audience ing fees, "You might get a good reading,
which gathered early outside the Perform- but the odds are against it," he said.
. _ When asked how a young writer might

‘ learn to write, Kennedy said, “I don’t
think you can teach a writer how to be a
good writer. You’re not going to be able to
impose talent on a writing student."

“[11] you tell a European you have a
writer’s institute, they'll laugh up their
sleeves at you. ‘What? You teach how to
write?’," said Kennedy, who is founder of

   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

the New York State Writer’s institute,
which is housed at SUNYA.

Kennedy went on to say, “A good
r writing teacher guides the student. It’s like
what a good editor would do.”

He spoke at length about the importance

of ﬁnding a good agent and a good editor.
“it‘s like getting married, when you find
an agent,” he said.

“Agents are very popular,” said Ken-
nedy, but he added, “it can be a Catch-22,
you can’t get published until you get an
agent and you can't get an agent until you
