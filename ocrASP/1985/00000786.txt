He also stressed the importance
of an agent who is experienced
with the particular type of Writing
being done. “if they don’t have a
personalized relationship, they
will retreat," he said.

Kennedy said he considers
himself lucky because his current
agent has a partner who is a
movie agent. He said he is getting
“two for the price of one, or one
and a half, I should say.”

Kennedy said he was also pleas.

Ironweed. “Some editors will try
to write the book for you," he
said, adding he found editors

“The 78 acres of land across
Fuller Road was purchased a
while ago," said University Presi-
dent Vincent O'Leary. “This land
where the proposed site lies has
been unused in the past. We' have
been waiting to develop this area
until we had the money to start
the construction and now we have
it. That is why the land was pur-
chased in the first place."

Since access to this land is
limited by a narrow road, im-
provements will have to be made.
O'Leary said, “We will be widen-
ing the road to accomodate the
extra use that it will receive. It is
much too narrow to be useful.”

“Both sidewalks and lighting
will be installed for the future

Kennedy also spoke about the
amount of control a writer can
have over his writing. “You can
have as much as you want," he
said. However, “if you’re a needy
writer and someone wants to
publish it [your work], you don't
have as much [control]," he said.

“it is the substance of the re-
jection which is disheartening,"
said the author as he encouraged
aspiring writers to be persistent.

Kennedy’s Ironweed was re-
jected 13 times before it was final-
ly published by Viking at the urg-
ing of novelist Saul Bellow.
“‘Too many burns in the book.”
i was told. ‘Who wants to read
about bums, especially in
Albany?'," he said.

for University Affairs Lewis
Welch.

The new student housing will
be two or three stories and much
different from the design of the
four uptown quads.

“At this point we are still con-
sidering different programs and
options. We haven’t reached the
blueprint stage yet," Welch said.
“The land of the building site is
broken up into two sections, one
section of around 60 acres and the
other of about 10 to 12 acres,”
said Welch.

Welch said he expects a later
completion date for the project
than Stevens. “The work would
be started in 1986 and completion
wouldn’t be accomplished for 18
months to two years," he said”. [J

Harvard t-shirt is hottest thing on the market —

Cambridge, Mass.
COLLEGE PRESS SERVlCB — it’s
crimson and white and worn all
over, and its sales are
“somewhere up in the

stratosphere," one well-placed,

observer says. “It” is the Har-
vard t-shirt, which some say is
now the best-selling collegiately-
licensed product in the world.

Selling the shirts--a great many
to foreign tourists--has become
such a big business for the Har-
vard Coop Bookstore that it now
operates six retail outlets in the
Boston-Cambridge area. ,

Big Ten, lvy League and col~
leges that have good sports years
generally sell the most shirts,
reported Jim Rissing, national
college bookstore marketing
manager for Champion Products,
a Rochester, N.Y. ﬁrm that
claims to be the nation’s largest
producer of college t-shirts and
sweatshirts.

As budget cuts sent many col-
leges scrambling for money,
schools expanded their control
over products on which their
names appear, hoping to reap
royalty profits.

By joining a licensing
cooperative, for example, the
University of Alabama pushed its
royalty checks from $83,000 in
1983 to more than $100,000 in
1984. ‘

Penn State, Georgia Southern,
the University of Miami and the
Cal State system, among'others,
have adopted new logos in recent
years in part because their
previous symbols had become
part of the public domain. As a
result, the schools‘ could not

count on getting all the profits
from marketing their wares more
aggressively.

Although the Harvard name
and colors are in wide use, the
school, said Rissing, seems to be a
“unique, one-of-a-kind animal.”

He attributed the huge sales of
the shirts to’ the school’s
worldwide reputation, its large
and loyal alumni and to the
Coop’s labor policies, which en-
courage sales by paying dividends
out of proceeds.

Real status, however. accrues
to owning an authentic Harvard t-
shirt, available only at one of the
Coop stores.

There are many counterfeit
Harvard shirts sold throughout
Japan, where young people tend
to treasure American college
paraphernalia, said Ririko
Takagi, a Harvard coop shopper
from Los Angeles.

in fact, there are Harvard shirts
sold all over Boston and Cam-
bridge that aren’t the real thing,
either.

Clifford Brown, an assistant
buyer for the Harvard Coop,
stresses the shirts and parapher-
nalia sold at off-campus gift
shops, bookstores and souvenir
shops are about, not of, Harvard.

“We’re the official insignia
store for Harvard and M.I.T.
(Massachusetts Institute of
Technology) and the schools of
Harvard," Brown insisted. Since
the Coop doesn’t sell in bulk to
other retailers, one can buy
authentic Harvard shirts only at
Coop stores.

The t-shirts of other schools
have had their appeal diluted.

UCLA shirts were once so
popular in Japan, where people
refer to the school as “Yookla,”
that the school licensed a
manufacturer to produce the t-
shirts in Japan.

Geneva summit

Absent from Reagan's speech
was the sense of frustration con-
veyed by Gorbachev who spent
most of his news conference
discussing the failure to reach an
arms agreement. .

“I am pleased to report tonight
that General Secretary Gorbachev
and 1 did make a measure of pro-
gress here," Reagan said. “While
we still have a long way to go,
we’re at least heading in the right
direction. We moved arms con-
trol forward from where we were
last January, when the Soviets
returned to the table.

The speech capped a 20-hour
day for Reagan that included a
long trans-Atlantic flight across
six time zones. Even so, the
74-year old President looked
anything but tired as he strode in—
to the House of Representatives
chamber to a prolonged, standing
ovation from the members of
Congress.

in all the President summed up
his trip this way:

“A new realism spanned the
summit; the summit itself was a
good start; and now our byword
must be: ‘Steady as we go'."

Reagan‘s report to the nation
followed a summit that produced
agreements to meet again next
year in Washington and the year
after in Moscow, and accords on

issues such as a cultural exchange
and establishment of new
diplomatic facilities. But the two
leaders failed to break their
deadlock on the main business of
superpower arms control, and
Reagan said that on the issue of
so-called “Star Wars," the two
leaders had a very direct
exchange.

“Mr. Gorbach‘ev insisted that
we might use a strategic defense
system to put offensive weapons
into space and establish nuclear
superiority, ” the President said.
“I made it clear that SDl
(Strategic Defense initiative) had
nothing to do with offensive
weapons."

Reagan also said he restated his
proposal for “open laboratories"
for scientists from the Soviet
Union and the United States to
observe each other’s research on
strategic defense systems.

Reagan thus ended his three-
day venture into superpower sum-
mitry with a flourish. He began
the day with Gorbachev in
Geneva, then moved on to a
meeting with NATO allies in
Brusselis and ﬁnally home for the

_ speech. In all, Reagan spent more

than nine and one-half hours
while travelling 4,260 miles in the
air.

The President and his wife, Nan-
cy, were greeted by Vice-
President George Bush, O’Neill
(D-Massachusetts), and Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole.
After handshakes, the Reagans
and the other dignitaries boarded
a Presidential helicopter for the
ﬂight to Capitol Hill.

Gorbachev provided a report of
his own in a 90-minute news con-
ference before departing Geneva.
He said that “all restraint will be
blown to the wind" if the United
States does not compromise on
Reagan's “Star Wars." but also
declared that the talks were
productive.

Reagan said his summit partner
was an “energetic defender of
summit policy. He was an elo-
quent speaker, and a good
listener,” and added that the ﬁve
hours the two men spent in one-
on-one sessions were “the best
part — our ﬁreside summit."

But even as he praised Gor-
bachev's style, Reagan said blunt-
ly, “1 can’t claim we had a
meeting of minds on such fun-
damentals as ideology or national
purpose -— but we understand
each other better. That's key to
peace."
