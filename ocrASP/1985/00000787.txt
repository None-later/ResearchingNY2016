score of 379 is needed to qualify.
Freshman Geanne Curiff came within five
hundredths of a second from the current
pool record for the ZOO-yard backstroke.

and loo-yard freestyle, Chris Cawley’s vic-
tory in the ZOO-yard freestyle, and Nancy
Smith‘s victory in the 500-yard free style.-

The Russell Sage meet proved to be just
a warm up for the Great Dane Relays held
last Saturday. The team placed third out of
seven teams. The Albany Relay teams took
third place in four of the nine events while
divers Gail Mench and Marcy Geisser cap—
tured second place in diving.

The Albany State Bowling Club bowled
“up to their potential," in the words of
their President Sal “The Kingpin" Pered-
nia as its men’s and women’s teams both
claimed second place in the First Annual
SUNYA invitational, held at Boulevard
Bowl in Schenectady.

BOO-yard backstroke, with Bianthorne,
Curiff, and Cawley. and the ZOO-yard
freestyle with Curiff, Mary Daly, Cawley,
and Ely.

Had Curiff’s time been ofﬁcial in the

BOO-yard backstroke, she would have .

broken the pool record for the lOO-yard
backstroke. individual times are ofﬁcial
only for the ﬁrst person of each relay.

“1 was very impressed with some of the
times coming from the beginning of the
season, especially from Geanne Curiff,
Carol Ely, Chris Cawley, and Nancy
Smith," said assistant coach Caroline
Scharlock.

Ely and Smith, both juniors, seem to be
returning to the low times they obtained
while freshmen. said Scharlock.

Relays were Plattsburgh, Oswego, Vassar.

bott, and Albany. 1:]

Albany State senior Craig Parlan finished 11th at the Regionals

to quality for the NCAAs.

Harriers- send Parlato to Atlanta far Nationals

By tan Clements
STAFF WRITER

While the rest of us suffered through a typically
cold November evening in Albany, Craig Parlato
boarded a plane bound for sunny Atlanta, Georgia,
on Thursday. But Parlato was not travelling in
search of a tan or to visit Ted Turner, he was en

route to the NCAA Division 111
Championships.

Parlato earned his all-expense paid weekend by

finishing a surprising eleventh at

Regional qualifying meet held Saturday at Sunken
Meadow State Park in Long island.

“i thought last week was my last

senior co-captain. “i wasn't planning on coming in
‘ the top twenty.”
_ His expectations were justiﬁed. After leading the

Danes in the first half of the season,

to be growing stale. as his teammates ﬁnished ahead
of him frequently during the latter part of the

campaign.

He had a slow start on Saturday, but “he just
kept moving up, passing clumps of runners," said

Coach Bob Munsey.

Because the field was spreading out as he worked
his way through it, Parlato did not realize how close

he was to the leaders.

“1 was surprised when i found out i was

eleventh,” he said.

Placing eleventh enabled him to extend his season
by a week as he was the third runner to ﬁnish who
was not on one of the three teams that qualiﬁed.
The ﬁrst six runners who are not members of one of

the qualifying teams are eligible as
the nationals.

Great Dane women runners fail to qualify
for NCAAs to end season on sour note

EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

The Albany State women’s
cross country team enjoyed suc-
cess this past season, but they
couldn’t put the icing on the cake
Saturday, failing to qualify for
the NCAAs at the regional
qualiﬁer held at Sunken Meadow,
Long island.

Step by step, the team's train-
ing was planned by Coach Ron
White, who mixed interval
workouts with distance runs.

Four of the top seven runners
were returning from last year’s
varsity, which had placed eighth
in the Division 111 NCAAs.

The team also placed fifth at
the New York State Meet, as well
as at the ECACs, but the peaks
that White felt could have been
reached weren't.

A year had passed since the
1984 cross country regional
qualiﬁer. Last Saturday, the
Albany team was hungry.

Albany was outdistanced over
the challenging course by ﬁve
other teams, placing sixth in the
regional qualiﬁer.

clocking 18:51.7 for the ﬁve-
kiiometer course. As expected.
ithaca won the meet. Joining
them for the NCAAs in Atlanta
will be Cortland, Plattsburgh,
Geneseo, and the University of
Buffalo placed third, fourth and

ﬁfth respectively.

“it wasn‘t the season we could
have had,” said White. He add-
ed, “When a program gets so
high, it’s almost impossible to
top.

“The whole region has gotten
much stronger. The top-notch
cross country runners are staying
in the state without scholar-
ships," White said.

Termed “a good, average
team," by White, the women har-
riers had “no bad races, but no
really outstanding races," at
Sunken Meadow. White said.

Running her ﬁnal collegiate
cross country race, team co-
captain Karen DeFeo placed thir-
teenth with a 19:41.6 clocking.
Twelve seconds away was

“We're losing 16 players, in-
eluding some very important peo-
ple, but we’ve still got a good
nucleus established," said Ford.
“ithaca used the ECACs as a spr-
ingboard (to the NCAAs), and
there’s no reason why we can't do
the same. We also can tie for the
most wins in school history with
nine."

sophomore Kim Pettichord, plac-
ing nineteenth.

Also concluding their collegiate
cross country careers were seniors
Bette Dzamba and Lynn Jacobs.
The dynamic duo placed 30th and
35th in the ﬁeld.

Completing the Albany team
were juniors Brenda Watson
(44th) and Kitty Sullivan (57th)
along with freshman Jackie
Phipps (59th).

“1 think based on last year,
people expected more. Based on
the circumstances, we did as well
as we hoped for," said Dzamba.

“The team unity came together
at the end of the season," said
Jacobs.

As for the icing on the cake,
well, that remains to be seen in
the future. D

Meanwhile, the Panthers! in-
centive lies in gaining
respectability.

“We’re ready. We‘re looking
to prove that we can play against
the Division 111 powers, the
Albany's, the Wagner's, the
Union's," said Paltanawick.

“i think that Albany doesn't
necessarily respect New England
football, so we’re looking to pro-
ve that we're on the same level,"
said Cottone.

So, although the Danes' 1985
ﬁnale is somewhat of a head-
shaking anti-climax, there’s still
plenty to prove. El

ing perhaps their best meet of the season despite
missing a Nationals berth by one place. By scoring
120 points, the Danes finished behind the three
Atlanta-bound teams, R.1.T. (33). lthaca (75) and
St. Lawrence (83).

“I wasn’t planning on
coming in the top
twenty.”

“We peaked at the right time, while they didn't,”
said Munsey./referring to the other SUNY teams at
the meet. Though they ﬁnished fourth at the
SUNYAC's. the Danes outraced every SUNY team
at Sunken Meadow.

Behind Parlato, who ran the 8000 meter course in
26:19, were sophomore Pat “ Porge" Paul (22nd,
26:19), Ian Clements (26th, 26:47), Ray Volper
(28th, 26:51), and Jack Glaser (38th, 27:03). Trevor
Hash (48th, 27:20) and Tim Hoff (52nd, 27:30) also
competed.

While Parlato refused to seriously predict how he
would perform (“1 want to get ﬁrst," he claimed,
tongue planted ﬁrmly in cheek), Munsey said, “i’d
like to see him in the ﬁrst seventy, ﬁrst sixty." in
previous NCAA's, Parlato placed 70th last year and
142nd in 1983.

“it'll probably be the toughest nationals ever,"
Munsey predicted. “l’ve looked at some of these
teams, and they’re just ungodly.”

But, he added, “There's no pressure on Craig to
support a team. He's got everything to win and
nothing to lose."
