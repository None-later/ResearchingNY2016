When the word came on Sun-
day that Western Connecticut‘s
victory over Hofstra had propell-
ed them ittto the NCAA Division
[[1 playoffs, leaving 8-2 Albany
State out in the cold, an emp-
tiness set into the hearts of the
Dane players and coaching staff.
But by midweek’s practice, the
team's spirits had risen from the
"' depths as they prepared for Satur-
day's ECAC tournament game
against 8-2 Plymouth State due to
several incentives, the most

motivating of which is proving
that Albany should be playing in
the NCAA playoffs, not Western
Connecticut.

“l was really concerned on
Sunday," said Albany State head

coach Bob Ford. “1 thought they '

were going to have to dig 48
graves and everyone would fall in
them, and then the coaches would
shovel the dirt on top.”

Ford thinks that a convincing

with a loss by Western Connec-

the NCAA selection committee
that Albany State deserved the
playoff spot awarded to Western
Connecticut. Especially since
Western Connecticut's lone
defeat was to Plymouth State.

“l'think it will at least make a
statement about how strong their
(Western Connecticut’s) league
is," said Ford. “It's an oppor-
tunity to make a statement about
our program. and a chance to
play a school that has gained a lot
of recognition in the last couple
of years."

Ford was referring to the fact

that this is the third straight year
Plymouth State has gone to post-
season play. The Panthers receiv-
ed an NCAA bid last year and
played in the ECAC tournament
the year before.

 

the Panther attack as an adequate

passer who can be a threat to run

also.

“We key our offense toward
whatever defense we’re playing
against," said > Plymouth State

“I thought they were going to have
to dig 48 graves and everyone
would fall in . . .”

Another incentive, specifically
for the Dane defense, which has
shut out three of Albany’s last
four opponents. is stopping
tailback Joe Dudek, who has
scored 468 points, an NCAA
record. Dudek has scored a
phenomenal 23 touchdowns this

. season, only one of which came

on a pass reception, and has harn-
mercd out 1,370 yards on the
ground.

“Dudek has the advantage of
running behind offensive line
standout Dave Watson, a 6’3",
265 lb. right tackle, but Watson's
prowess doesn’t force Plymouth
State to gear their attack to the
right side exclusively, according
to Plymouth State offensive
backﬁeld coach Jim Paltanawick.

“We don't necessarily force

much talent, it doesn’t matter

Plymouth State’s offense
usually runs a Wing T or I-
forrnation to best take advantage
of Dudek’s abilities. Senior
quarterback John Sperzel guides

head coach Jay Cottone. “If that
means using Dudek more or pass-
ing more, we'll do it."

defense thathas made shutouts
the norm in the latter part of the
season and has exhibited an op-
portunistic style that features a
goal-line stand comparable to a

Gordon impressive in Dane win over Potsdam

By Cathy Errig

Not only did the Albany State Wrestling Team win the

in the Great Dane Classic last Saturday. “It made him a

lot quicker and improved his balance."

The Danes’ only losses were at 167, where the Danes

ponent, 15-0, to win by technical fall of l90, and

heavyweight Chris Tironi. who pinned his opponent.

The Danes took on R.P.I. last night at University Gym,

   
  
  

war against Potsdam on Tuesday night, they also won the
battle.

One of the Danes' few weaknesses, the I26 lb. weight
class that was dominated for four years by NCAA cham-
pion Dave Averill, showed a significant increase in
strcngth. The strength was supplied by 5'7" Freshman
Andy Gordon. and his performance sparked the Danes to
a 4l-9 trouncing of Potsdam.

“Andy's win really psyched everyone else up for the
match." said co-captain Shawn Sheldon. who pinned his
own opponent at 118. “It was a lot of fun after that.
everyone was into it and got up for the match.“

(iut‘don's opponent was sophomore Rick Bart. who
had placed fourth in the SUNYACs last year. Gordon
was trailing Bart, 11-1, in the third period, when he pinn-
cd llttrt with a cradle.

“He had been dominating the match," said Gordon,
who had been recruited by Franklin and Marshall and the
University of Delaware in addition to Albany. “I really
didn't expect to win."

Proceeding Gordon‘s big victory had been Sheldon's
pinning of Rick Flick, which occurred in the second
pcriod of a match co-capttiin Jim Fox described as, “A
demonstration of just about every wrestling move there
is."

Winning his match ill 134 was Freshman l’ttul Prosser.
whosc win further strengthens the Dane lower-Weight
situation. At 142 John [lulog pulled out all stops to record
it solid 9-0 Dane victory.

ISO lbs. was completer dominated by Fox, its he easily
won his match, 20—2.

"It was the haircut," said cocaptuin Marty Pidcll.
who sat out lltc match due to the elbow injury he suffered

forfeited. and at 177, where Freshman Mike Simon,
wrestling up a weight class. was narrowly defeated, 8-5.

Also winning for the Danes were Sophomore Arne
Soldwcdal at 158, Junior Jake Sabo, who defeated his op-

 

 

a match in which they further experimented with their
lower weight situation. Tomorrow, they will travel to
Rhode Island to take down Brown, Boston College. and
the University of Maine. l—l
