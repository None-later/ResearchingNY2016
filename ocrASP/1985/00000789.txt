@speculation

t was Thanksgiving, about ten years ago, when my father was subjected to
family-style dining during our family-style vacation in Pennsylvania Dutch
Country. My father called it "the sticks" and sought entertainment in trying to
take pictures of Quakers before they could run away. He captured at least 20 souls

 

on film.

Family-style dining was the Way to go in Dutch Country, my mother assured us.
Dad consented, "If you want to go sit at a picnic table with people you don’t know
— people who you probably wouldn’t like if you did know, that’s fine with me.
Let's go." So we did. I

At the far end of a table of old, overweight, work-ethic Pennsylvanians, we were
a family of young, underweight, fun-ethic Long Islanders. The meal was spent
more in passing food than in eating it. Passing was done by method of requests
such as, “Toss me some turkey,” which were always met by food-displaying replies
of, “You bet!" Much to our confusion and embarrassment, every time someone
said, "You bet!" my father said, "foxes." The Pennsylvanians smiled at him politely,
assuming that it was a strange Long island expression that hadn't yet reached the
sticks. .

As soon as we escaped from what my father called the "dining ordeal,” we asked
him why he kept saying "foxes" whenever someone said "You bet." He sat us
down and told us a Romulus and Remus-type of story about three Long Island
babies who were raised in the wilderness by foxes and returned to their parents
years later. I looked at my brother and sister to determine whether or not they
bought it.

“Is that true, Dad?" my sister asked, wide—eyed. “You betl" he assured her.

It was then that my father proposed a family pact that, if at all possible, our fami-
ly would spend every Thanksgiving together, even when (and if, he added) we're
all grown up and have moved away. We said, "You bet,“ and, of course, my father
said "foxes." ‘

It wasn't until last year that the truth of "You bet" — "foxes" was revealed. It
happened in Waldbaum’s — Isle 2. I spotted "Fox’s U<Bet" brand chocolate syrup
on the shelf next to the Yoo Hoo. When I confronted my father, he admitted that
he drank it straight as a kid; he never liked milk.

Now we're grown up somewhat, and moved away to some extent (if college can
be called "away"). And on November 26 my parents, too, are moving away.
They’re breaking the tradition of waiting for retirement to move into a con-
dominium, and they’re doing it now, while they can still enjoy the hot tub.

This Thanksgiving, rather than sit on boxes and take in fried chicken, we're spen-
ding the day at my brother's house. When I heard he had offered to cook, I called

challenged.

"You betl i took home-ec.," he assured me. "You put it in the oven, watch foot-
ball for a while, take it out, and eat it." Then he let me in on a secret —— he's going
to make “herb” stuffing.

Last night I asked my suitemate Linda if I could come over her house for lef-
tovers Thursday night.

“You bet,“ she said.

“Foxes,” l replied, of course.

Folk favorites play at the Paace

   
  
   
  

David Bromberg

WCDB

he following is a list of the top

91 rock songs of all time as

determined by the listeners of
WCDB. One of the events
organizers, Greg Rothschild, said,
“The countdown, aside from being
an excellent representation of
WCDB's format, is also a pretty good
mix of the classic songs and the new
music that We (WCDB) introduce. It's
very obvious that a lot of listeners
took part in the balloting and were
very conscious of, not only their
favorite songs, but what constitutes
classic rock n' roll.”

Enjoy.

purest forms of American art. It is

the art of being able to take stories
and basic human experiences and put them
to music. It’s appeal lies in the fact that,
since the songs are mostly stories and
everyday experiences, one need not be an
expert on music to appreciate this art form.

business: John Sebastian, David Bromberg,
and Arlo Guthrie.

John Sebastian’s set included a song call-
ed “Morning Blues," which is about an ex-
perience all of us with those killer 8:15
classes can relate to -— waking up the mar—
ning after. His set continued with a cheer-
ful "It's a Beautiful Day for a Daydream"
and a song called “Fishin,” which he played
upon request from someone in the au-
dience. This is another point about folk
music, because of the down-to-earth every-
day topics of the songs, there is an amiable
intimacy between audience and performer
which cannot be achieved in most other

surveys

forms of music. Sebastian's set ended with
a blues harmonica solo that the audience
clapped along to.

Next on stage was the David Bromberg
Trio. Since I was completely unfamiliar
with Bromberg, this was the most pleasant
surprise of the evening. He seemed truly, at
home on stage and had an extremely
friendly, easy-going stage presence. Most
of his songs focused on the more
humorous aspects of life. This was most ap-
parent during a song about being attacked
in his hotel room by roaches. Bromberg
and ‘his trio were joined on stage by
Guthrie and his band for a folksy-blues ver-
sion of "Da-Do-Ron‘Ron.”

After a short break Arlo Guthrie and his
band came back on stage. The Guthrie
family has influenced three generations of
music starting with Woody Guthrie (who
has profoundly influenced the likes of Bob
Dylan and Bruce Springsteen, especially on
his Nebraska album) and ending with
Arlo’s son Abraham, who is now the
keyboard player in his father‘s band.

John Sebastian

Guthrie's set Was sharply political. His
first few songs were about the plight of the
American farmer. After "Freight Train" the
songs took a turn towards current events,
with a dedication of the song "All Over
the World” to "the boys at the summit,"
and closing with "Amazing Grace,” which
announced was written by the captain of a
slave ship who turned around in the mid-
dle of a voyage, because he realized what
he was doing was wrong. He concluded by
saying, “Let's hope that people will never
be afraid to stand up and do something that
they know is right."

In an age of "Top 40” and mindless
“Technobop” it is refreshing to see such
pure, down-to-earth music being made
with so much care and skill, and it is en-
couraging to know that folk music can
never, never truly fade away. As long as
people keep having new experiences and
things keep changing in the world, there
will always be people to put these ex-
periences to music, a medium which as the
Guthrie family has shown us is easily pass-
ed from generation to generation, and
which all people can relate to. '
