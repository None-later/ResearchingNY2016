if this gourmet cuisine is really all that it

Now, i know that 99 percent of the peo-
ple reading this will be thoroughly
uninterested in what i have just said, but
after having been subjected to SUNY food.
and even food that Mom buys at home
from the supermarket, i think we should all
give a thought to the questions which Dr-
ville Schnell raises in his book'Modern
Meal.

B efore you take another bite out of

 

 

llormcmos. and ting.-

 

novel, dips into the core of an old

fashioned American town,
Hopewell, Kentucky, in the year 1984, ex‘
ploring subtle and blatant aftereffects of
Vietnam.

The story is told through the eyes of a

I n Country, Bobbie Ann Mason’s first

 

 

-bright, athletic, 17-year-old girl, Sam

Hughes. Her father died in Vietnam before
she was born. She lives with Emmett, her
uncle. Emmett, a veteran who hasn't held a
job since coming back, has bad acne on his
face, which Sam is sure is Agent Orange
related. Sam loves, pities, and reveres Em-
mett and can't leave him when her mother
moves to Virginia.

Early in the noiIel we see Sam is overly
curious to find out what her father was
like. Soon, she wants to know what the
war was like and why veterans like Ema
mett are having difficulty adapting to
civilian life. No one will give her straight
answers.

Emmett and other veterans meet every
morning at McDonald’s for breakfast. Sam
joins him, and becomes involved with
Tom, a 35-year-old mechanic who fixes
and sells her a volkswagon. Sam spends the
night with him and finds he physically can

Neither I nor Mr. Schnell are raving
vegetarians campaining for animal rights
— so don't be put off from that point of
view. The book raises many Valid points
concerning the antibiotics and hormones
used today in meat production, and as
such, is worth reading.

No one is really surprised to hear about
the lack of meat and the overabundance of
other assorted goodies in the processed fast
foods we all eat, but i think you will be sur-
prised to hear what happens to the meat

we buy straight from the butcher, before it L g

ever reaches his shelves.

Mr.Schnel| concentrates on the drugs us- '
ed daily in meat production to control ‘

disease and promote growth —— mainly in
cattle and pigs. He also deals with the new
animal-feed technologies employed to in‘
crease food efficiency and the hormonal
compounds designed to enhance growth
and manipulate reproduction.

The main question the book raises is
whether we should be afraid that the meat
we eat is actually unsafe for human con-
sumption. This is perhaﬁs putting it a bit
too strongly, but the evidence is there to
suggest that our meat contains much more
than the average customer bargains for.

Readers are left to decide for
themselves, while the facts are presented
clearly and are easily understandable, even

to those of us who do not major in organic M

chemistry or spend our weekends dissec-

ting flies’ eyeballs. The book certainly.
opened my eyes to the pros and cons of '

making money through selling meat. if
you care at all about the effect the food
you eat has on your body — or the fact
that most of the food additives benefit on-
ly the farmer's bank balance— Modern
Meat is well worth a read“ El

 

not make love due to some mysterious
psycho-somatic problem other veterans
have. They speak in the morning:

“It was OK. over there,” he said, nod-
ding his head slowly. "lt was the best life i
ever knew, in a way. it was really
something."

"Emmett never said anything like that.
He said it was horrible."

"Well, a lot of it was. But there was
things you got out of it that you just
couldn't get any other way.”

"Like what?"

"Oh, ldon't know. it’s hard to explain. It
was just the intensity of it, what you went
through together. That meant something."

The veterans, working or umemployed,
no longer have any intensity. WhenEmm-
mett came back from Nam, he hung a Viet
Cong flag from the town’s bell tower. We
see him crying at the last episode of
M‘A‘S‘H, unable to sustain a relation-
ship, unwilling to confront a debt he owes
to the United States government, and
neglectful of dealing with Agent Orange.
We also see jim Holly, a real estate agent,
who leads the Vietnam veterans organiza-
tion, broken to tears when no one attends a
veterans’ dance.

Unfortunately. the novel gets a little
thick and sentimental towards the end, as
Sam gets hold of a diary her father kept in

My new juliet

Not our families do fued

the war. The violence described in the
diary is not‘heroic, and her father’s account
seems inhumane. Sam attempts to recreate
some of the horror by camping out at a
swamp and being bitten mercilessly by
mosquitoes. As she 'denounces her father
for his actions, Emmett defends him by in-
sisting, "You can’t do what we did and be
happy about it. And nobody lets you
forget it." They eventually travel to
Washington where they visit the Vietnam
Memorial. _

Bobbie Ann Mason is at her best when
she picks little elements from today's
culture such as a Beatles' song released in
i984, M'A'S'H, and jim Morrison. She
successfully echoes the past and connects it
to the present. The constant clicking of the
cable changer, the ordeal of buying a used
car, the craze of Pac Man; these bits of pop
culture which have become so familiar to
us are meshed with the context of the
serious problem of coming to terms. with
the realities of war. -

it is a firm start for Ms. Mason. In Coun-
try is not a masterpiece, but has charm and
truth. Hemingway couldn't comment an
HBO or Agent Orange. It was not part of
his time. In Country poignantly reflects
upon our times. Bobbie Ann Mason's pro-
gressiOn in contemporary literature may be

 

      
    
      
     
 
    

worth dibbing tabs on.

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
   
     
     
     
       
    
     
    
   
     
   
   
     
     
      
     

Your eyes are not blind
she is black
I am white
so opposite we sound
lonliness
knows no colours
dark grey is all around

If the world had its way
it would free us
swiftly
tear us apart
not two lightened
souls
would you see us

just two
more lonely

hearts.
