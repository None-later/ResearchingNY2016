stirgqestions
of qtiad-“safety 

By Jim Avery
STAFF WRITER

A rash of early morning burglaries,
coupled with vandalism, harrussmcnt
and assault has left many Alumni Quad
residents thinking twice about safety
precautions and the adequacy of the
protection given them.

Six burglaries have been reported in
Alumni Quad dorms since the middle of
November. All the incidents were believ-
ed to be related. in addition, students
have reported other incidents both in the
dorms and in the surrounding
neighborhood.

“1 thought he was going to grab me
V and throw me in the back of the car,"
said a 22 year old female resident of
Pierce Hail after she was stopped by two
men in the Alumni Courtyard late at
night on the 19th.

The woman who asked that her name
not be used had returned from a late
study session when she found she was
followed by a “brown sports car." She
exited he’r car. but before she could
ascend the stairs to the dorm's door one
of the two men approached her while
the other remained in the car with the
engine running and the lights on.

“He asked me if i wanted to share 10
or 20 cigarettes," she said adding,
“Then he reached for my arm." She
said the incident haunts her when she
studies late away frotn home. “When
l'm coming back and i see a car like that
one. it makes me wonder.

The University Police Department
(UPD) Administrative Aid Nancy Loux
said this is an isolated incident.
unrelated to a wave of burglaries which
hit the downtown quad recently. “the
descriptions don't match," she said.

Kegban rally draws 500 despitevFriday’s chill

By Jim Thompson
STAFF WRITER _

Friday's drizzling rain and cold
temperatures failed to deter 500
protestors who were rallying
against SUNYA’s new policy ban-
ning kegs and beerbalis.

The demonstration, held in
front of the campus center small
fountain, was sponsored by Stu-
dent Association.

“lt was a smashing success,"
said SA President Steve Gawicy.

* “The student turnout was great.

if the weather was better we
might have had 2,000".
“This year the students have

- created the two largest protests in

SUNY Albany's history." said

Gawiey, referring to Friday's
rally and one held earlier this
semester. “Student involvement
is like a force. once it's rolling,
you ride it as long and as far as
possible . Right now the student
movement is ﬂowering," he said.

The rally began with Gawley
urging students to call University
President Vincent O'Leary and
Vice President for Student Af-
fairs Frank Pogue to voice their
disapproval of the alcohol policy.

SA also printed an extra edition
of The Student Voice to advertise

 

the rally and inform students on
the issue, according to Gawley.

Vice President Ross Abelow
spurred on a cheering crowd with
an emotional speech and the bur-
ning of a copy of the alcohol
policy.

Jeff Stettin, a Resident Assis—
tant on Dutch Quad, spoke on the
drawbacks of the decision from
the point of view of an RA.

“it shouldn’t be up to me to
deprive the people in my section
of their privacy rights. 1 shouldn't
have to play policeman," he said.

According to Gawley, there are
many negative aspects of the new
policy such as the change in the
role of RA's and the refusal of the
administration to follow the
recommendation of the “impact
of 21" not to ban becrballs and
kegs. The recommendation pass-
ed by a vote of 8-2.

“O'Leary and Pogue simply ig-
nored the recommendation and
did what they thought was best,"
said Oawlcy. who signed a pro-

Frathouses  be allowed in city

By Rick Swanson
STAFF WRITER

1 Several SUNYA fraternities, and

sorbritics are looking into moving
oft‘w-campus. perhaps by forming a frater-

‘nity- row, but many obstacles’must be over-

come before such a move can be made.

Barry Pollack, president of Tau Kappa
Epsilon(TKE), said “about eight to ten
fraternities and sororities-are hoping to
move off—campus" next fall.

“One major problem we’ve had [in the
search for of f—campus housing] has been
that we’re going about it separately," said
Pollack.

"That’s the reason we got together,"
Pollack said, adding that the group is not
well defined. but that many seem in-
terested in moving off.

Ross Abelow, president of in-
ter—Fraternity Council, said that “we are
in very basic planning stages" for frater-
nities moving to an off—campus location.

“There are no set plans by anybody."
said Abclow, adding that the fraternities
are “only thinking about it.”

Dick Patrick, City Planning Director of
Albany, said “Nobody has anything
against the idea of a fraternity row—it's
just where are you going to put it."
“Everybody has seen ‘Animal House’."
said Patrick. “it was funny, but no one
will want to have it next to them."

Patrick suggested that the establishment
of fraternity houses would not be in violu-
tion of the city's Grouper Law. which
limits a rental unit to no more than three
unrelated people living together.

Patrick explained that a fraternity could
be legally set up as a “rooming house that
could hold up to 25 people in it."

' “if you are in a commercial zone. you

would need a special use permit," he

added.

When asked where a likely place for a
fraternity house or a fraternity row would
be in Albany, Pollack answered “We

 
  

don‘t know."

“if you ask me, i would say somewhere
on Central Avenue would be best,"
Patrick said, but he was reluctant to say it
would be' easy for fraternities to find an
off—campus location.

“This is a city that's celebrating its

‘triccntehnial next year," said Patrick, ex-

plaining that it is even difficult to open a
doctor's office in Albany.

“it's hard to get something new started
in this city," Patrick said. He also said he
does not want to dissuade students,
however, and commented “it won‘t do any
harm in exploring the project."

Pollack said some of the fraternities and
sororitiesare “looking to rent in the fall of
1986 [and we] are hoping to buy the
residences within two years time."

"We're looking for a place where we
would be within a mile radius ," Pollack
added.

According to Pollack. TKE. with 62
members,.ls the only fraternity that was

ofﬁcially granted housing on campus. with
males and females sharing a hall on Col-
onial Quad.

Pollack said fraternities may also con-
sider a “fraternity area" on campus. if
possible.

“We're looking into setting up housing
for fraternities on one of the Quads."
Pollack said, adding that this plan had no
certainty to it.

When asked what the difference might
be between regular off—campus students
and students living in a fraternity house,
Patrick said that among other things,
“The front lawn would turn into a parking
lot."

“There was a fraternity in Syracuse that
boasted it had as many cars as brothers."
he said.

Patrick also said that Syracuse Universi-
ty could better accomodnte fraternity
housing because its campus is more spread
out. “SUNY Albany, on the other hand, is
its own island."
