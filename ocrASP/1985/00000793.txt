PREVIEW OF EVENTS

 

 

  

 

Tax reform examined

Washington, D. C.
(AP) The Reagan administration is analyz-
ing a far-reaching tax bill produced by the
House Ways and Means Committee, try-
ing to determineyif the president can pro-
vide the endorsement congressional leaders
say is necessary to keep the tax-overhaul
drive alive.

For the moment, says White House
Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan. “l'm not
sure we can accept it,” noting the commit-
tee made major changes in the bill at the
last minute before approving it Saturday
morning.

“What does it do to investment, savings
and incentives?” Regan asked Sunday on
“Face the Nation" on CBS-TV. “We
haven’t had time to really examine that."

In announcing ﬁnal approval. Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski. D-ill.. the committee chair-
man, pleaded with Reagan not to make a
harsh, snap judgment that could kill the
bill.

 

The Store

County denied suit

Albany
(AP)The state doesn’t owe local govern-
ments a cent for holding convicted felons
in their jails until state prison cells become
available. State Court of Claims Judge
Harold Koreman has ruled.

Koreman’s decision. which was publicly
released Monday, dismissed a "Inulti-
million dollar lawsuit filed against the state
by Monroe County. The ruling also affects
five other claims totaling $1,683.199
brought against the state by the counties of
Monroe, Ontario. Onondoga and
Westchester, said Nathan Riley, ,a
spokesperson for state Attorney General
Robert Abrams.

Upon sentencing of convicted felons,
state law requires the county sheriff to
deliver them to the state Department of
Correctional Services. Because state
prisons didn‘t immediately accept the
sentenced felons, the state should pay the
county’s cost of jailing them. local of-
ficials argued.

State increases tine

Albany

the amount of fines and penalties they col-
lected during the first part of the year.

The party is not over yet, but judging
from the way SUNYA students celebrated
this past weekend. one would assume the
end was near. v

Because the 21 year-old drinking age
takes effect December 1, many students
had their last chance to visit local bars and
attend parties on campus over the
weekend.

Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) fraternity
held a “Goodbye to U“ party, the last U-
lounge party to be held on campus before
December 1. “The party was undoubtedly
a success." said TKE Vice President Paul
Wagner. “A lot of people showed up early
but left later to go downtown for one last
chance to hit the bars."

Sigma Alpha Mu (SAM) threw a party
at Bicycle Armies. which. according to
SAM President Charlie Green. was “very
successful, as 300 attended."

“We felt we had to have a party before
the drinking age went up," said Green.
“Because advertising for the party was so
extensive. I don’t think there were too
many people who didn’t know about it,"
he said.

“We really went all out. more so than
most people would have for a party this
scale." Green said.

Despite the success of this weekend's
parties. State Quad Board cancelled their
“Rock Around the Quad Party" which
had been originally scheduled to take place
on Friday. November 22.

“It was in competition with too many
other things going on around campus,"

“People came out later and stayed longer than usual. "

said Quad Board Secretary Marijo Ford.
“1 think students were more interested in
getting off campus because this week was
their last weekend to go to local bars." she
said. ‘ .
“We have a beer ball in our suite every
Friday night." said Tony Heavey, a
sophomore living on indian Quad. “Last
Friday we had to celebrate the end of that
tradition because of the ban on bulk con-
tainers." he said.

Brian Cashin, also an indian Quad
sophomore, commented, “i want to enjoy

is taken away from me." Cashin and his
friends also got up at 6:30 a.m. Saturday
to go to Skipper’s Tavern for their last
8:00 a.m. opening.

Skipper's Tavern traditionally opens its
doors early in the morning on St. Patrick’s
Day. “A lot of people were expecting
another St. Patrick‘s Day." said Tim Gun-
ther. co—owner of Skipper's. “Three girls
were waiting on the stoop when i came to
open the bar at 7:10 in the morning."
Gunther said. By 7:55 a.m.. l25 people
were standing in line to get in.

“Most of them were still drunk from the
night before.” Gunther said. “l’d say
about 90 percent of them had been up all
night," he added.

“it was a good group. and there was
minor damage to the bar," Gunther said.
explaining that, some people danced on the
tables; 3 9 k...

Across the Street Pub did their “usual
stable business." said Manager Mike Ar-
duini. “A lot of students headed for the
downtown bars because it was their last
opportunity to barhop."

The Long Branch was “busier than
usual" on Saturday night. according to
owner Ron Howard. “People tended to
want to say goodbye and they had a much
more relaxed attitude toward each other."
he said. “it was similar to what happens
before a holiday or a long vacation. lt
tended to be a lot of fun." he said.

People came out later and stayed longer
than usual. said Washington Tavern
bartender Allan Catlan, who worked at the
bar Saturday night. “People seemed down
about the changes that were about to take
place. but they managed to have a good
time." he said.

 

 

WCDB regains
total power to
air countdown

By Bill Jacob
ASSOCIATE NE W5 EDITOR

WCDB-9i FM‘s transmitting power
was seriously curtailed this past month
because of a transistor failure, but
repairs were made the day before the
“Top 91 Countdown." their ﬁrst
listeners’ survey. was aired.

The station’s broadcasting power was
reduced from 100 to 15 watts on
November 4 when an output part of the
transistor. part of the transmitter. burn-
ed out. This severely limited the sta-
tion’s output capability, said WCDB
General Manager Jon Cosin.

The station's broadcasting range was
limited during the time in which the
transmitter was being repaired, Cosin
said. “it cut us down to just the city of
Albany on a good day," he said.

Cosin said the problem started last
winter when a radome. a ﬁberglass ball
which protects the antenna, broke dur-
ing a snowstorm. “Too much power
was being reﬂected back into the
transmitter” and that blew the transmit-
ter. Cosin said.

According to Cosin, the repair of the
transmitter took 16 days because of the
difﬁculty in locating new parts and the
time involved to actually have the
transmitter repaired.

“There was only one place we could
ﬁnd [the part] in the nation." Cosin
said. The one person who was capable
of ﬁxing the transmitter also had the ﬂu
at the time, he added.

WCDB considered postponing the
“Top 91 Countdown" but in the end
did not have to make a decision. “It was
brought up brieﬂy and we said ‘let’s
wait and see."' Cosin said.

WCDB received a few complaints
from listeners concerned about the sta-
tion's reception. Cosin said. “They
couldn't receive us or we were coming in
fuzzy" in many areas, he said.

The transmitter is located on top of
Eastman Tower on State Quad and was
purchased in 1978 for approximately
$5,000, Cosin said.

WCDB does not anticipate any fur-
ther problems with the transmitter.
Cosin said, and has not considered
puchasing a newer one. A decline in the
number of station listeners is also not
expected. he said.

The only way to ensure that an inci-
dent such as this does not occur in the
future is “to move Albany to a warmer
climate," Cosin said. adding that he
hopes this winter will not be too severe.

 

 

 

SUNY board approves differential dorm rates plan

By Alicia Clmbora
NEWS EDITOR

Last Tuesday's 8-to-l vote by the SUNY
Board of Trustees approving differential
room rates among SUNY campuses has
met with vehement opposition from stu-
dent leaders.

Differences in dorm rates between carn-
puses could be as much as $250 which. ac-I
cording to Student Association of the State
University President Jane McAlevey in a
Times Union article. could force students
to choose a school based on room rates
rather than academic standards.

McAlevey was the only member of the
board to vote against the proposal,

The plan. in its first year, places a six
percent cap on variations from the
estimated $1650 per year room rate, and a
future cap of 15 percent. The plan does
not, however, llmlt room rate variations
within campuses.

At last months Trustees meeting. the
board approved a SLIB billion budget
under which room rates would increase an
average of six percent as a first step

 

 

“Differences in dorm rates...cou1d force
students to choose a school based on room
rates rather than academic standards.”

—— Jane McAlevey

 

towards self-sufficient dorms. but did not
make a decision concerning differential
room rates until Tuesday. according to
theTimes Union

In approving self-sufficient dorms,
SUNY will lose its 86.6 million state sub-
sidy for residence halls.

The self-sufficiency plan allows in-
dividual campuses to set their own room
rates within the guidelines set by the
board.

According to Steve Siroky, SASU's Ex-
ecutive Vice-President. “Differential room
rates will severely llrnit access to lower in-
come students. It will close lower income
students out of better housing."

SASU is “very disappointed" at the
boards decision. he said.

“The state thinks self-sufﬁciency will
help students. We think self-sufficiency
will hurt students," said Siroky. “We‘re
taking it to the legislature—we intend to
fight it." he said.

According to Student Association Presi—
dent Steve Gawley, SUNYA‘s room rates
will increase about $95. “We stand to face
these increases every year for the next
several years." he said adding that these
increases discoursge people from going to
school.

“if the state gave greater priority to a
committment to higher education. inﬂa-
tionary increases would be allocated for in
the state budget.“ said Gawley.

SUNYA has 34.9 million to make up
(from state money) because of self-
sufficiency. said Gawley asserting, “I'll
encourage Student Action Committee if
necessary. to lobby Higher Education
committees to make necessary changes."

(iawley said he has already met with
Gene Gilchrist. University Building 0f~
ﬁcer. regarding Student participation in
maximizing revenues and decreasing costs
for dorms. _“We have to work with the
university to increase revenue." he said.

Oawlcy cited water and electricity eon-
servstlon as areas where the university can
save money in residence halls.
