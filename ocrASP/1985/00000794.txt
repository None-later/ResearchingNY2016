The crowd around the Campus Center
fountain at times looks more like at Macy’s
than a University. but students seem to en-
joy the marketplace while student groups
look to it as a unique source of income.

All sorts of scarves and every possible
type of earring is available — along with
sweaters, gloves. sweatshirts. watches.
records, tapes. and more. Last week you
could even get a winter coat there.

“People have a lot of money and if you
have the right product you can make a lot
of money." said one podium vendor.
Adam Wasserman.

A little further away Steve Jefferson was
attracting women passers—by to his wares
with the cry: “If you ain’t a Gloria
Vanderbilt lady, then I don't know who
is!"

A closer inspection showed that, indeed,
the jeans, sweaters, jackets, gloves, and
thermal underwear he was selling all had
the Vanderbilt swan sewed on.

Jefferson said his merchandise was pur-
chased in New York City’s garment
district, and was being sold for the benefit
of the Albany State University Black
Alliance (ASUBA). He said he didn’t mind
spending up to four hours a day selling for
ASUBA, but, “After Thanksgiving we’ll
hopefully be inside. It gets so cold out here
you can't stand."

As far as his customers, Jefferson said,
the prices are reasonable. “We cater to the
females. Females buy more," he added.
“They don't mess around. if they want
something they get it.“

Jesse Ortiz agreed that the prices charg-
ed by most vendors were fair. As she rifled
through a rack of tweed overcoats she
said, “I’ve got to admit these racks at—
tracted my attention. and if I find
something, hey, I‘ll get it."

Eventually Ortiz found the perfect over-
coat, and bought it for $50. Compared to
the prices at department stores. she said
she saved a bundle. And besides, “I need—
ed a winter coat anyway."

The coats were on sale for only two days
last week, with all profits going to Student
Association’s Health Advisory Commit-
tee, said the group‘s president, Devin
Okay.

He called the overcoats “the new fad
look" as he explained the coals were pric-
ed between $20 and $50.

The coats were bought in New York Ci-
ty, added Okay. who said the group is con-
sidering putting the overcoats on sale once
a month.

All vendors have to get permission from
SA and the University to sell on the
podium in the form of a Solicitations Per-

mit, said SA Director of Student Program-
ming Betty Ginzberg, who handles the pro»
cess for SA.

In addition, said Ginzberg. “There‘s no
selling for private gains anymore. it’s all
for organizations." The changes, she said,
were made at the beginning of this
semester to comply with state laws which
say no state facilities can be used for
private gain.

“I like to see people selling things on the
podium, it‘s a nice aspect of the Universi-
ty." said Ginzberg, adding that in the past
she's bought perfume. jewelry, ﬂowers.

Around campuses: Twenty years ago—-

‘Fink’ clause protested

“Students at Amherst College are
protesting a new set of parietal rules. in-
cluding a so-called ‘rat fink‘ clause
which makes all residents in each dor-
mitory responsible for reporting viola-
tions of the social code.“ College Press
Service reported on October 5, 1965.

To protest. about 100 students refus—
ed to hand in signed honor code cards to
the school registrar.

The students also wanted to extend
the time by which women were required
to leave men's dorms each night.

Sororities’ doom soon

"A University of California
sociologist says that sororities, long in-
ﬂuential in manipulating the campus
social order, now face extinction." Col-
lege Press Service reported on October
13. I965.

Cul~Davis professor John F. Scott
said colleges. anxious to fill the big new
dorms they were building. wouldn't be
“as hospitable to greeks. who draw
students into private housing, as they
used to be."

“But the worst blow to the sorority
system is the increased academic

donuts. and other “stuff” from podium
vendors.

Talking to women browsing on Thurs-
day. it was clear that just about everyone‘s
favorite item was earrings because they’re
inexpensive and “fun,” said one shopper.

“Yeah, she buys earrings all the time."
said Drew Fung of his girlfriend Paula
Amsterdam.

have time for the form of courtship that
made sororities so exciting." he
explained.

Computer sensations

The American University in
Washington D.C. caused a sensation
when it decided to use an exotic new
technology — computers — to catch
students who parked illegally around the
campus. College Press Service reported
on October 7. 1965.

Administrators boasted they could
track parking violators by computer.
automatically compose and mail warn-
ing letters, and even flag students with
five or ruore unpaid tickets for
“dismissal from the University."

One professor compared the effort to
“George Orwell’s 1984," but ad-
ministrators said a few officials front
other colleges already had called to find
out how the strange new effort worked.

Contraceptive conflict

After a heated debate. the National
Student Association — precursor of the
United States Student Association ——
resolved to ask Catholic colleges to

dent tastes

According to Amsterdam, a lot of the
merchandise available on the podium is in-
expensive and therefore ideal for college
students. And she added there’s a lot more
to buy than earrings.

Not too far away from the display of
earrings, Stacy Bavdavid was selling con-
cert photographs of stars such as Sting,
David Bowie. and Foreigner, to benefit the
Accounting Club. The photos were priced
from $5 to $10 and were taken by Bav-
david's partner's brother-in-Iaw, she said.

Bavdavid said she likes her job. “I feel
like I'm on the outside looking in on the
diversity of Albany State. It‘s a great way
to meet people, but it’s impossible t6 stand
up here all day. It gets too cold."

Sweaters make nice gifts for the holiday
season, and that was one pitch Cindy Blat-
ter was using Thursday afternoon. She was
raising money for the tennis team, and had
a brand new inventory to-tempt shoppers.

“We are selling under cost,” said Blat-
ter, explaining that she can afford to do so
because both her and her partner's father
manufacture sweaters.

A lot of guys buy sweaters for women.
Blatter said. “They look seriously. but

[they usually have to be talked into buying

one. I get a lot of questions from guys."

Delores Wood shops at the fountain to
buy items such as socks, scarfs, or records.
she said. “The prices are competitive and
it’s convenient, especially if you don't
have a car."

Ed Flatterman said he occasionally
shops at the small fountain to buy presents
for his girlfriend and for himself. “I think
I get a bargain buying these items. The
prices are competitive and I like to pur-

chase from students to help the clubs,” he

added.

And Wasserman, with his ‘right pro-
duct’ philosophy, sells Albany State sweat-
shirts with Minnie Mouse on the front for
$14 to raise money for the Delta Omicron
Tau fraternity. “We‘ll be out here until we
get rid of them, and we better get rid of
them or we are in trouble. We have a big
investment here."

But proﬁts are not guaranteed, and that
has Wasserman a little nervous. Right
now, he said, he’d be happy just to break
even. “I‘m getting nervous, it’s too slow,"
he said. '

students who ask the campus health
clinic for it, College Press Service
reported on September 13. 1965.

Delegates to the NSA's national con-
vention in Madison. Wisconsin plasmid
an amendment deleting a requirement
that schools distribute “birth control
devices” as well as information.

“To delete ‘devices’ would

one outraged delegate. But the amend-
ment passed.

Options to war sought

“An international conference of in-
tellectuals and students seeking alter-
native solutions to the war in Vietnam is
meeting at the University of Michigan."
CPS reported on September 13. 1965.

The conference included luminaries
like historian William A. Williams.
physicist Hans Betha, sociologist David
Riesman. Linus Pauling and James D.
Farmer of the Congress on Racial
Equality.

In subsequent histories of the era,
many observers credited the conference
with providing the then minlscule antl-
war movement with intellectual
legitimacy.

Personality and perseverance
may play a more important role
than academics for students who
wish to succeed in the business
ﬁeld, according to corporate ex-
ecutives speaking at an informal
brunch on Sunday.

Thirteen business executives,
whose children are attending
SUNYA, shared their corporate
expertise with students at the
brunch held in the Patroon
Room.

Close to 200 students attended
the event, which Was sponsored
by the University Parents
Association in collaboration with
Pi Sigma Epsilon, the sales and
marketing fraternity.

“These speakers are parents
themselves of SUNYA students
and they're interested in their
children's academic advisement."
said Sorrel] Chesin, Associate
Vice-President of University Af-

fairs and moderator of the event. ‘

“We capitalized on the parents’
volunteered expertise," he said.
During the brunch, informal
discussion took place where each
executive was seated with about
ten students at a table. A formal
discussion followed after brunch
that began with comparisons of
the more prestigious private in-
situations such as Harvard or
Wharton Business School. with a
public university like Albany.

John Levato, SUNYA’s Direc—
tor of Undergraduate Academic
Services for the School of
Business, said. “Albany is among
the best of any public universities.
We don't have the clan that a
Wharton or Harvard graduate
has, but the Albany graduate does
get hired.

Why? Because of our stress on
a liberal arts education. Our
graduates have the ability to com-
municate orally and in writing."
he said, adding “you also have to
pay your dues. It's a two-way
street. You can’t walk in and say
‘Here I arn’."

Levato said the main difference
between SUNYA graduates and
graduates from prestigious
schools is that “Whartons expect
to be a vice-president as soon as
they get out, whereas students at
SUNYA start from the bottom
and. if they’re good, work their
way up. They learn values at a

_ public university." he added.

Dr. Harvey Kahalas, Dean of
the School of Business. agreed,
saying, “Many firms do regard
Albany as a very important
recruiting source in terms of
public finance.”

Morton Z., Schwartz, Vice-
President of Congress Financial
Corp., stressed, “It's important
to get a general education,
because 50 percent of business is
dealing with people."

“This is the bottom line —— ma-
jor in that which makes you hap-
py. Just know how to discipline
yourself with a good education,"
Levato said.

All the executives agreed that
pursuing the M.B.A. directly
after the undergraduate degree
would be much easier. “It's dif'
ficult to go back to your studies.
once you've already gone out and
maintained a job,” said John
Blauner, Vice President of Grun-
tal & Co. of Woodmere, N.Y.

During the forum. the speakers
explained what firms look for
when recruiting .
