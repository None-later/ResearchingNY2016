in naming new coffee bar

By Leslie Chalt
STAFF warren

A love of coffee coupled with a little im-
agination is sending two SUNYA students
on a free trip to Fort Lauderdale during
Spring Break.

v The winners in last week’s “I Love Cof-
fee Week" contest to name the new coffee
bar are senior Scott Forde and ﬁrst year
student James Liptak. Each came up with
the winning name “The Ground Floor,"
according to Lester Hynes. University
Auxiliary Services Director of Cash Sales.

Both will receive a free trip to Fort
Lauderdale from March 24 to 27 said
Hynes. The trip includes airfare, hotel ac-
comodations at the ‘Hilton and a rented
car. he said adding that each trip is worth
over $600.

According to Hynes. the winners were
chosen by a selection committee made up
of Student Association Comptroller Eric
Schwartzman. SA Programming Director
Betty Ginzburg. Ross Flax of the Coffee
Development Group, Hynes and several
students.

The committee categorized and matched
similar names for the bar and then narrow-
ed it down to about 18 names, said Hynes.

Other prizes awarded included a

And the winner is...

“Riproc Bop" was voted the winner
of the second annual battle of the
bands. Rock-N-Roll Warfare. held by
Telethon ’86 at JB’s Theatre on Satur-
day, November 23.

The event raised $1,800 which will be
donated by Telethon ‘86 to the Child
Cancer Care and Spina Bifida prgorams
at Albany Medical Center and to the
Parson's Child and Family Center. Ad-
mission for Rock and Roll Warfare was
$5. 350 attended.

“The bands were great," said Sandra
Lehrman. chair of the event. “Riproc
Bop was super, and the money is going
to some worthy causes."

Teachers cut class

Maryland state education officials in
Baltimore. Maryland were startled at
the results of a new survey which in—
dicated a need for 9.000 new teachers
through 1987. State universities and col-
leges said they expect to graduate a max—
imum of 3,000 students who plan to
pursue teaching during the same period.

“We didn't expect the teacher shor-
tage to develop in almost every area as
quickly as it did." said George Funaro,
Deputy State Commissioner for Higher
Education in Maryland.

Funaro said the current critical areas
are math, science and foreign language.
but he expected the shortage will soon
effect virtually every school program.

“We are now seeing the consequences
of school underfunding. years of
teacher abuse. years of undervaluing
teachers and education.“ said Beverly
Conellc Stoncstrcct. President of the
Maryland State Teachers Association.

Calling all papers

The Union College Undergraduate
Review is accepting submissions for its
Spring. 1986 issue. according to Phil
Bean. editor of the Review.

The Review “was founded three years
ago to provide a forum for
undergraduate 'work in the Humanities
and Social Sciences." said Dean adding
that submissions are accepted from all
colleges and that this is not “purely a
Union College publication”.
"Submissions may be based on
iesearch or on materials read and

 

 

‘ in class." said Dean.

 

 

runner up .and a $20 gift certiﬁcate to
Record Town. won by Peter Byme as se-
cond runner up.

Three other students, Frank Gultler.
Lynn Snyder and Carlos Mayor also won
two pounds of coffee each as the third run-
ners up.

According to Hynes. 6.000 cups of cof-
fee were served over the 4 days of “1 Love
Coffee Week.” Said Hynes. it was “a wor-
thwhile promotion. It was well received.“

Students were given the opportunity to
taste different types of brewed coffee dur-
ing the promotion of the bar and SA and
University Auxiliary Services are hoping
their efforts will provide an alternative to
alcohol.

 

“Creative writing or poetry will not be
accepted...(as) the emphasis of the
Review is on the quality of the written
argument or discussion.” he said.

According to Bean, the deadline for
submission is February 7, 1986. Papers
should be sent to Box 2590, Union Col-
lege, Schenectady. NY 12308.

No change to spare

The only change machine in the Up-
town Library has been in the repair shop
since Monday. November 18. according
to Peter Recore-Migirditch, head of Ad-
ministrative Services of the Library.

“it was removed because it’s not get-
ting power and we don’t know
why.”said Reeore-Migirditch. He added
that the machine is library-owned
equipment.

“We hope that it’ll be back any day.
but we don’t know when.” he con-
tinued. “The person who works on it
was ill and he only recently returned to
work," he said.

“This is a bad time not to have a
change machine," he said. adding that
during the week “we have change at the
circulation desk. but on weekends we
don’t because we can't replenish the
source of change."

Hotline saves lives

During the first six months of the
operation of The Samaritans, a local
suicide prevention agency. 4.833 people
contacted the hotline, according to
Karen Wasby. executive director of The
Samaritans. who added that an average
of 26 calls per day were received during
the period.

Wasby said that “60 percent of the
callers and visitors were female (and) 40
percent were male. Fifty percent were in
the very high risk category of under 30
years old. Over 20 percent of the initial
contacts were ‘third party’ callers. or
(those) concerned about a friend or
family member." site said.

According to Wasby. the numbers of
attempted or completed suicide is on the
rise nationally. “Suicide is now respon-
sible for one American death every 20
minutes." she said. ading that in 1984.
there were a total of 121 suicides in the
Capital District.

The Samaritans is staffed by
volunteers and has a 24-hour phone
hotline. 463-2323. and walk-in services

Despite being grilled for over
twenty minutes last Friday after-
noon, Vice President for Student
Affairs Frank Pogue stood ﬁrm
and said the University‘s ban on
kegs and beerbalis will remain a
part of SUNYA’s alcohol policy.

An impromptu meeting bet-
ween Pogue and more than twen-
ty students took place when
Pogue came out of his ofﬁce to
meet students demonstrating
against the ban. which had been
approved two weeks before.

When students challenged the
legitimacy of the ban, noting that
Pogue‘s own “Implementation of
21" committee had voted to allow
beerbalis by a vote of 8—2, Pogue
replied, “Committees make
recommendations and that's all."

“We get the feeling that the
students’ recommendations were
ignored," one student said after
Pogue said he had received a
variety of proposals from dif-
ferent sources, not just the ‘21‘
committee.

“You can feel this way...[but]
it’s pretty much of a democratic
process." replied Pogue to

Pogue stands firm on banning bulk containers

 

 

widespread laughter and disbelief
among the students present.

Pogue explained that the
University fears being named in
liability suits if students under the
age of 21 consume alcohol and
then damage property or hurt
people. “Our response to that
was to reduce alcohol in bulk
containers."

Students said they believed only
those individuals involved would
be liable for damages. but Pogue
said that even for a “dumb”
lawyer “to move from the in-

Area colleges contemplate
changes in alcohol policies

By Olivia Abel
STAFF WRITER

College social life is changing
along with thevalcohol purchase
age.

That seems to be the message as
area colleges adopt their policies
to the new state law. which goes
into effect December 1. And just
as SUNYA’s. University Council
voted to ban kegs and beerbalis
from the dorms, other schools are
either tinkering with. or rewriting
their alcohol policies.

Union College in Schenectady
has not yet adopted an official
policy concerning drinking rules
and regulations on campus. ac-
cording to Chris Siler, president
of the student government.
However. a recommendation put
together by a committee made up
of faculty, administration and
students has been endorsed by the
student government and is now
going to the President and ﬁnally
to the Board of Trustees for
approval.

The proposal would mandate
invitation only admittance to par-
ties serving alcohol, Siler said. but
he added that he saw problems
with the idea. “Before. there used
to be an average of three open
parties on a Friday night. now if
you happen not to get an invita-
tion. what are you supposed to
do?"

Siler agreed that the drinking
age change will affect social life.
“Right now most of our social
life is centered around fraternities
and on campus activities, but new
students will have to be looking
for other alternatives. They’ll
probably start going to bars
more.”

School sponsored events will
also be affected by the change in
the drinking age. A public event.

V which is defined by participation

of two-thirds or more of the cam-
pus will not include alcohol. said
Siler.

In addition. Union's eighteen
'fraternities will now be allowed to
invite to parties only double the
number of people in their frater-
nity if they wish to serve alcohol.
Siler explained that that means if

a fraternity has 25 members. they
may invite no more than 50 guests
to their party.

Right now the students' main
concern. according to Siler, is
protecting their two campus bars.
The Pub and The Skellar, as they
are popular student hangouts.

“We have one of the more
liberal policies concerning
alcohol," said Linda Hillin,
President of Student Affairs at
Siena College in Loudonville.
“We are not going dry." The Rat
will not close but it will change its
policy to serving alcohol only on
certain designated nights, she
said. adding that on those nights
only students 21 and older will be
allowed in.

School sponsored mixers will
not serve alcohol as well. but
drinking in the dorms. Hillin said,
will not be regulated. “What goes
on behind closed doors is not our
business and students can drink in
their rooms. "

Russell Sage College in Troy is
not planning to ban alcohol but
has adopted a complicated policy
concerning parties on campus. ac-
cording to Shelley Morgan.
Residence Program Director. No
drinking in dorms is allowed and
Resident Assistants are obligated
to issue a report if they find
anyone drinking. with further
reports possibly leading to ad-
ministrative action. she said.

For private parties of more

dividual to the institution is an
automatic thing” when seeking
large sums of money.

“You understand that what we
have is a policy, in terms of the
decision itself it’s been made,"
Pogue told one student.

Responding to students saying
the ban was an invasion of policy,
Pogue said. “1 think the Universi-
ty has a right and an obligation to
set standards." He added, “You
are free to do anything you want
as far as parties —— kegs are not
banned in approved places.”

“If you’re looking for
logic, don’t look
here...look to the

legislature. ”

—— Frank Pogue

Enforcement of the ban “has
not been discussed yet" by ad-
ministrators. said Pogue. adding
that two meetings with Resident
Assistants are planned for this
week. Student leaders have
previously expressed concern that
the ban will prove burdensome to
RAs and undermine relationships
between dorm residents and the
RAs.

“We expect MS to assist with
this." said Pogue. however, “it
will not mean a signiﬁcant in-
crease in the [RAs] workload.”

“l was an RA myself and
nothing has changed," added
Pogue. ‘

About the only peace offering
Pogue offered to the students was
a promise that the University will
evaluate the policy as it is im-
plemented and after it has been in
effect. “We will keep a close eye
on that this spring." he said.

“Any new policy that goes into
effect is carefully evaluated." he
stressed as students raised con-
cerns about increasing drug use,
hidden consumption, more use of
hard liquors, and relationships
with Ms.

“These are problems 1 can’t
deal with — ‘what abouts.’ "
Pogue continued. “We will be
able to answer a number of these
questions next semester."

Towards the end of the session,
which took place in the West lob-
by of the administration building.
closest to the BA building. Pogue
told the students the University
was only trying to live with a law
that the administration had no in-
put on. “If you’re looking for
logic don’t look here...|ook to the
legislature."
