Improving job market comes as no
surprise to SUNYA career advisor

By Rosalind Blokel

Recent predictions indicating that the
job market for students graduating in I986
is loosening up came as no surprise to the
man responsible for helping SUNYA
graduates find their ﬁrst job.

“Everything I've read indicates a strong
economy and when there is a strong
economy. people are hiring," said Stanley
Schwartz, director of the Career Develop-
ment Center.

 

Job prospects
look fa vorabie
for ’86 grads

Bethlehem, Pa.
COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE — Students
who graduate in 1986 will enjoy “slight-
ly" better prospects for landing a job
than I985 grads, the College Placement
Council (CPS) predicts.
All told, American businesses expect
to hire about two percent more grads
next yrar, the CPC found in its annual

mart. :t.

The CPC’s report. the first of three
national job outlook surveys published
by major agencies in November and
December of each year, forecasts better
times ahead for most kinds of majors.

But last year, the CPC’s rosy predic-
tions of a bumper job market for college
grads did not come true, in part because
of the computer industry slump.

“The recovery, slowed down to some
degree," explained CPC spokeswoman
Rhea Nagle. “The big fall-off in the

 

 

 

Silicon Valley was the category we were
off in."

This year “there will be plenty of op-
portunities (for computer majors) out-
side the computer industry." said John
Shingleton, placement director at
Michigan State and the sponsor of
another of the annual job outlooks.

Shinglcton expected his report to ap-
pear in afew weeks, and that it also will
indicate a “slightly” better job market
for the Class of 1986.

In the CPC survey, firms said they ex-
pected to hire seven percent more
business grads than last year. They also
forecast having four percent more open-
ings for masters of business administra-
tion, although last year was a bad one
for MBAs.

Students with degrees in science, math
and technical disciplines--cxc|uding
engineering--should also experience a
slightly improved job market, CPC
predicted. Employers expect to hire
three percent more bachelor’s grads in
these areas and I3 percent more who
have a master’s, CPC data show.

Employers’ predictions of engineering
grads‘ prospects “are contradictory."
Naglc said. “Employers are saying one
thing. but when they project ﬁgures.
those figures show a decline."

The data indicate corporations will
hire ﬁve percent fewer grads this year,
but in interviews engineering executives
thought there would be a rising demand
for engineers. explained Naglc.

“It's particularly surprising at the
bachelor's level because they have been
the most sought after for a number of
years." she added.

Companies expect to have seven per-
cent more job openings for engineering
students with advanced degrees,
however.

Liberal arts majors face a similarly
confusing job market, Naglc contended.

While the data show companies an-
ticipate hiring three percent fewer liberal
arts majors in the coming year, many
employers say they are Increasingly in-
terested in hiring humanities students.
Naglc said. D

 

mid ' or assessment of the student job

“Most students from this school come
from the New York City region, which has
a much higher competitive job market
than the rest of the country," he said.

“The Sunbelt is where there is fast-rising
growth and it is easier to get a job there
than in the New York City area." he
added.

Many students “have blinders on" to
the job world. he said. because they only
know the New York market. “The
economy is thriving compared to recent
years."'he said, “and it is easier to‘gct a
job in this country than many students .
think.

“Of course, this doesn’t mean you can
walk right into a job right after college,”
Schwartz added. “but the prospects are
better this year than last."

Schwartz said he was optimistic about
job placement chances this year.

“We’ve been through tough times." he
commented, “and the fact that percen-
tages are growing concerning job-hiring
reﬂects the fact that the economy is doing
better." 4

“It is easier to get a

job in this country

than most students
think.”

~— Stanley Schwartz

 

 

In the survey, conducted by the College
Placement Council, students with masters
degrees in science, math and technological
skills were forecast for strong increases, as
were business school graduates and those
with MBAs. The report also said
Humanities ﬁelds majors faced a decline
however.

“This data,” said Schvvartz, “can be

misleading._ Anyone who is bright and has
skills can get a job. Technical skills are
much more marketable than non-technical
skills. such as those in the Humanities,” he
said, “and that is why their prospects are
up...
But, Schwartz said. everyone will
benefit from the current strong economy.
Evidence from the survey supports this,
for although the survey showed a three
percent drop in job prospects for liberal
arts majors, interviews with employers
revealed an increased interest in hiring
liberal arts majors. with employers
recognizing the value of the skills liberal
arts majors have.

Dr. Gregory Stevens, assistant Dean of
Humanities. agreed with Schwartz that the
statistics can be misleading. He stressed
that the percentages are for hiring directly
out of college, which means that “students
with technical skills will be able to find
jobs faster, for they are already trained for
a speciﬁc job‘." -

"But." he pointed out, “most people
change jobs and ﬁelds a few times before
they stay in a certain job." Liberal arts
majors, he said, “are behind when they
first get out of college, but in the long run
the skills they learn help them to pursue
long range education such as grad school
or other paths that can lead them as far as
they want to go."

Stevens also said that graduate schools
for business are looking for liberal arts
majors as well as business majors. “Skills
such as communication, writing. values
and ethics are invaluable, in terms of long
range education." he said, “and more and
more businesses are realizing this."

“Since many people do change jobs."
Stevens pointed out. "you have to ask
what skills carry through. Learning how to
