Shawna future [It @goﬂmu ’

By Donna Baggott
Everyone at one time or another ex-
periences depression. In fact, mild depres-
sion is the most common emotional distur-
bance in America today. Depression is a
normal part of living as long as it is not
prolonged or on a regular basis. Serious
depression. however affects one of five
eople at some time in .
fheir lives. 

There is a broad range
of symptoms which are 
common to depression.

Changes in behaviors 

and feelings include social withdrawal,
neglect of responsibilities, poor concentra-
tion, irritability, inability to gain pleasure
from enjoyable activities and loss of sexual
desire.

Changes in biological functioning may
occur. such as in eating and sleeping pat-
terns, in addition to unexplained aches and
pains. In a mild depression, dejection or
discouragement are usual feelings, whereas
in a more severe depression, feelings of
very low self-worth, utter helplessness and
suicidal feelings may be experienced.

The causes of depression are multiple
and complex, as they are unique to each
person. There are, however, several com-
mon causes. First of all, certain personali-
ty characteristics may be involved in
predisposing an individual to depression.
People who are highly self-critical, very
demanding or unusually passive and
dependent may be prone to depression.
Environmental inﬂuences may play a role
in causing depression too. Unfavorable
family, social or working environments
can be conducive to depression.

One of the most common explanations
of depression is separation or loss. The
loss may regard an event such as divorce,
death ofa loved one, loss ofone‘sjob, end
of a relationship, moving to a new place,
or even graduating from school. The grief

  
 
 

Getting to roots of depression may
facilitate a better understanding

one experiences from the loss or separation
is turned inward in overly dependent tn-

".dividuals, and develops into an on-going

process of self—blame and ‘guilt. The loss
may be viewed as a rejection.

A second commonly given explanation
for depression is learned helplessness.
Although anxiety may be the initial
response to a stressful situation, it is
replaced by depression if the person comes
to believe that control is unattainable, or
that negative outcomes are unavoidable.
The depression-prone individual tends to
attribute bad outcomes to personal,
global, stable faults of their character.
They will fail to initiate action that might
allow them to cope.

Thirdiy, physical causes are often nam-
ed as possible reasons for experiencing
depression. Hormonal or chemical shor-
tages or imbalances are thought to play a
role in some cases of depression. Certain
medications, low-grade infection or the in-
itial stages of a cold or the ﬂu can also lead
to depression.

In dealing with depression, it is impor-
tant to identify the potential sources of the
depression. Is there a key event that set it
off? When did it happen? Where did it oc-
cur? Where did it begin? With whom did it
occur? Is there a definable pattern? A
systematic analysis of such factors can
contribute to an understanding of the
depression.

University Counseling Center, Student
Health Services and Middle Earth are all
places on-campus where one may seek help
in dealing with depression. Middle Earth
counselors are trained to help people cope
with their problems and are available to
talk at almost any time. Feel free to call
Middle Earth at 442-5777 or stop by
Schuyler Hall, Room 102, Dutch Quad,
between noon and midnight Sunday
through Thursday, and 24 hours a day on
the weekends. El

srxrr wanes,

In an effort to make Americans
more aware or the seriousness of
diabetes, the American Diabetes
Association (ADA) has named
November as National Diabetes
Awareness Month.

, Barbara Nichols, Executive
Secretary of the Capital District
Chapter of the ADA said,"‘The
three major goals of National
Diabetes Awareness Month are
education, research and the detec-
tion of the unknown diabetic." I

The ADA is seeking to educate
the public, as well as the diabetic,
on the prevention and complica-
tions of diabetes, and' ac-
comodating the diabetic person,
said Nichols.

The ADA deﬁnes diabetes as
“a disease in which the body does
not produce or properly use in-
sulin, a hormone that is needed to
convert sugar, starches and other
food into the energy needed for
daily life."

    
  
  
  
    
   
   
    
  
 
   
    
   
    

however ADA scientific experts
are conﬁdent that recent research
discoveries will lead to a cure.
Diabetes is divided into two
categories: Type I and Type II.

   
      
    
 

Protest

<Front Page
slowly dispersed.

“I was very pleased with the
Way everyone conducted
themselves in such a peaceful
manner,” said Gawley.

“This is more than a protest for
the alcohol rights, it’ a protest for
student rights,” said Charles
Green, president of Sigma Alpha
Mu fraternity. “I think it’s un-
fair and if we try long and hard
enoughthe policy will be changed.
This is going to ruin the college's
social life,” said Beth Rubin.

Chris Stein said the reason he
came to the rally was , “I am in-
terested in what’s going on and
feel the policy must be changed.”

In an interview after the rally,
Gawley said SA has different
things planned for every week.
Tuesday SA will be encouraging
students to call O’Lcary and
Pogue before they leave for the
Thanksgiving recess.

   
 

calls to each of them during the
course of the day,” he said.

Next week, Gawley said SA is
planning individual lobby visits to
Pogue and O’Leary.

Stettin‘discussed aspects of the
protest during a post-rally inter-
view. “I was happy with the tur-
nout out although the weather
probany lowered it,” he said.

When asked how his participa-
tion as a speaker would affect
relations with his supervisors,
Stettin said, “So far nobody has
given me any flack personally.
Supposedly other RAs were
threatened. ”

O’Leary was unavailable for
comment as he left Albany Friday
for a business meeting in New
York.

Gawley said he felt O’Leary’s
absccncc was very “convenient”

scheduled for that day.

“As it stands the policy re-
mains in place and will go into ef-
fect December lst," saif Pogue.
“Honestly I think the University
should have taken the route of
many colleges and become ‘dry’.
The University wouldn’t be as
liable as they are now. I think it’s
a very reasonable policy,” he
said.

There is no cure for diabetes, '

We’re hoping to get 300 phone ‘*

since the rally had also been,

“Type I, insulin-dependent
diabetes, is found in 15 percent of
all cases, usually in children and
young adults," reported the
ADA.

Type I is the most severe of the
two types of diabetes. Symptoms
of this form of diabetes often oc-
cur suddenly. The ADA indicated
warning signs of "extreme thirst
and hunger, frequent urination,
rapid weight loss with easy tiring,
weakness, fatigue, irritability and
nausea and vomiting.”

Type II, non-insulin dependent
diabetes, is a more common form
of the disease and occurs in
almost 85 percent of the cases
detected. Nichols said, “This
form of diabetes develops mainly
in persons who are over the age of
40, and are overweight.”

Persons who have this form of
the disease still produce insulin,
but their body cells resist the in-
sulins actions. They may go for
years without realizing they have
diabetes, she said.

The symptoms for Type II
diabetes come on slowly and may
seem minor. According to the
ADA, symptoms include
“fatigue, frequent urination, ex-
treme thirst, itchy skin, blurred

.ru .

vision and sores that heal slow-
ly." Patients may require some
sort of oral medication but, many
times can be treated with diet con-
trol and exercise.

Nichols said, “There really is
no way to prevent diabetes if it
runs in the family. However," she
added, “no one should be grossly
overweight."

Diabetes can strike practically
anybody, according to the ADA.
but the disease “occurs in twice as
many women as men, and is
found more frequently among
black and low income
populations.”

Statistics from the ADA report
that more than 12 million people
in the United States have
diabetes. It is now considered to
be one of the worst diseases of
our time. Statistics also show that
diabetes results in a “tremendous
$18 billion-a-year drain on the
U.S. economy.

The ADA is not federally sub-
sidized and relies totally on public
support to help diabetics and their
families. The Capital District
Chapter of the ADA is presently
holding phone-a—thons and bike
a-thons to gain money for their
cause. El
