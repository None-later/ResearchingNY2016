Health insurance rate hikes to bypass

By Llnda Greenberg
STAFF WRITER

Malpractice insurance rate hikes will
have no effect on the cost of services pro-
vided by the Student Health Service at
SUNYA, even though nationwide large fee
hikes are predicted because of rising
malpractice rates.
in the State University of New York
system, state employees are covered by Ar-
ticle 17 of the NY State Constitution,
which is a public officers law dealing with
professional liability. Fulltime employees
of the Student Health Service do not have
to purchase malpractice insurance because
they are covered under Article 17," ex-
plained Associate Vice President for
Health and Counseling Services. Neil
Brown.

Medical Director Doctor Norman Den-
nis agreed, saying “Article 17 covers
anyone who may work for the state ~—
engineers, architects, attorneys, physi-
cians, and others. The only instance that
malpractice insurance rates will affect
these workers is if they do other work on
the side, such as consulting."

in case of a malpractice suit involving a
state employee, “A suit would be filed in
the Court of Claims. and the State At-
torney General’s office would act as the
legal defense for the employee," said
Dennis.

“i don’t see the malpractice issue caus-
ing an increase in rates. There will be no
cost increases for the remainder of this
year," said Brown.

“As for the next year, “The only thing
that would cause an increase in student
health insurance rates is an increase in the
cost of pharmaceutical supplies. We have
no control of. that. Also, a slight increase
in rates is to be expected due to inﬂation,"
he added.

“There could possibly be a modest price
increase with the expansion of Services,"

said Dennis. “More laboratory procedures
may be available at the Student Health
Service that would help us to obtain

quicker results with on-site laboratory

equipment at a lower cost to students,”
Dennis commented.

“For instance, a blood count at a
hospital might cost $12, but here at the in-
ﬁrmary, it would cost only $6. it would
cost less for students, while at the same
time generating six extra dollars of income
for the Inﬁrmary," he said.

“This additional income would be used
to hire additional staff or to provide addi-

tional services.” said Dennis.

Brown emphasized that “The Student
Health Service has a no-proﬁt motive; any
additional income goes into the Health
Services account to improve Brown em-
phasized that “The Student Health Service
has a no-proﬁt motive; any additional in-
come goes into the Health Services account
to improve services for students. As state
employees, we are on ﬁxed income
salaries, so the extra money only beneﬁts
students. Student satisfaction is our goal."

Keith Welz, a member of the Great
Danes Wrestling Team who injured his

knee and required orthoscopic surgery as a
result said, “i received outpatient surgery
at Child’s Hospital and am being taken
care of here at the Infirmary. The Inﬁr-
mary costs a lot less than staying at a
hospital and 1 am getting excellent care
here.” said Keith.

Other areas of the Health Services that it
may expand to, said Dennis, are being con-
sidered. “Right now there is little or no in-
surance coverage for students involved in
intramural athletics. This is one area to
work on," said Dennis. ‘

 

Kalamazoo, MI
COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE ~ Health
center fees on the nation’s campuses are
about to go up, college health ofﬁcials
around the nation say.

Students at Western Michigan
University, for example, are paying
higher health center fees this semester
because WMU’s insurance company
wanted to charge the school $500,000
more than last year for malpractice
insurance.

Although no one has ever accused
WMU of medical malpractice and col-
legiate malpractice suits are rare, experts
say students nationwide soon will share
WMU's misfortune. They also predict
many campus health care facilities will
be cutting back programs over the next
few years. ~

They say it's because skyrocketing
malpractice insurance rates are affecting
campuses for the first time this year, the
experts explained. “Where student
health centers have been insulated up to

 

now from the increase in malpractice
rates, they won't be anymore,” said

438- 1856

Health Center fees to rise across nation

Steve Blom, director of the American
College Health Association.

Added Eugene Marquardt, president
of the University Risk Managers
Association: “if we can't get it resolved,
institutions will be forced to cut back on
training and health care treatment. They
just will not be in any position to take
chances."

Many large schools with medical
training facilities already have been
unable to buy enough malpractice in-
surance. Companies are refusing to of-
fer insurance in some cases because of
increasingly large court awards to pa-
tients who claim they have received im-
proper or poor treatment.

In response, college risk managers
across the country currently are drafting
plans to insure themselves.

Marquardt is confident that, by adop-
ting new tactics. most schools will be
able to keep their health service or
medical training programs going, but it
may cost students more.

say it’s only a matter of time before
higher malpractice rates catch up with
them. “1 sense the insurance industry is
saying ‘We‘ve got to do something
about these losses,’ and universities are
being swept up in that concern along
with everybody else.” Blom said.

This was echoed by officer An-
drew Panzer who responded, to
the courtyard incident. “Those
individuals were black. The guys
we're looking for in the break-ins
were white."

“1 took a report from a girl
in...Alden and got a real good
description," said Panzer referr-
ing to the individuals responsible
for the break-ins. Suspects, said
Panzer, include two individuals.
The ﬁrst is a white male, 5’9"
tall, medium build, with reddish-
brown hair and a full beard and
moustache. He was last seen
wearing blue jeans and a rust-
colored jacket.

The second is also a white male,
standing 5'6", weighing between
140 and 150 pounds, college age
with dark hair. He was last seen
wearing jeans, sneakers and a
short brown leather jacket with a
for or sheepskin collar.

On Wednesday the 20th, Loux
quoted UPD records to say,
“Over the last six day period
there were six burglaries in Alden
(Hall) and Waterbury (Hall).
Four of those were in Alden, two
in Waterbury.

“Because of the similarity of
the cases. it is suspected that the
cases are connected." she said.
The six cases grouped together all
occurred in the early morning
hours in unlocked rooms. No in-
cidents of this type have been
reported since the 20th according
to Loux.

A third floor Alden resident
described an incident she ex-
perienced with two men ﬁtting the
descriptions on the night of Satur-
day, November 16. “l was here

sion, Dudek runs of nine, 11 and nine
yards brought the ball to Albany’s 45.
Then the defense stiffened, and on fourth
and a foot, Dudek tried to fly over the line
for a ﬁrst down.

But his airspace was violated by a diving
Dmitrenko. who stopped the tailback in-
ches from his destination and gave Albany
the ball.

"We were in our goal line defense, and

.he tried a Walter Payton dive over the

Stack, but I dove over at the same time and
met him in midair," recalled Dmitrenko.

“He just chilled him,” beamed Ford. “1
could tell that that play really took the
wind out of their sails."

Albany failed to score, but got the ball
back with 1:22 left in the third quarter.
Dana Melvin scored on a 22 yard burst up
the middle after quarterback Mike Milano
had found Donnelly for a 24 yard comple-
tion on third and long, tying the score at 21

with'l4:10 left in the game. 'v

The defense held Dudeksand the Panther
offense in check once more, and the Danes
took the lead for the first time in the game
with 11:39 left when Milano hit Donnelly
for a 25 yard score.

The overworked Dudek couldn’t get
Plymouth State more than a field goal at-
tempt, which went wide left, on their next
possession, and the Dane wishbone took
over again, with Soldini, who gained 121
yards on 16 carries. relentlessly chewing
out yardage and Milano hitting his
receivers.

An end-around option pass from Don-
nelly to tailback Ro Mitchell produced 20
yards and a ﬁrst down on the Panthers' 22.
and Milano threaded the needle to Donnel-
ly two plays later for the touchdown that
closed the door on Plymouth State with
5:48 left to play.

Dudek left the game with 4: 16 left with a
sprained ankle after being hit by

' Dmitrenko. The Danes did survive a scare

when Panther fullback Jerome Minehan’s
40 yard touchdown run was brought back
because of a penalty.

Although playing in the ECAC gamc
was anti-climatic after the Danes had
hoped to recieve an NCAA hid, it did
produce its own rewards.

“We went up there hoping to make a
statement about our program, and i think
we did with that 33-0 second half," said
Ford. “1 was hoping we'd win like-35-0,
that would have really shown we were a

c .n...- ...;....~. -..A u.

vastly superior team,-but we went in at
halftime thinking ‘Geez, we better just win
this thing.’ We’ve never come back from
being 21 points down at halftime before. it
was a helluva way to end the season; i was
thrilled.”

PAW PRINTS — Donnelly ﬁnished the
season with 9‘touchdown receptions and
13 for his career. both Dane records...The
Panthers were penalized 12 times for a
whopping 144 yards...Dmitrenko had 14
tackles, including 6 solos...Milano went
6-11 for 78 yards.

 

 

Watch for the December
Sports Supplement featuring
Albany State basketball

 

 

 

By Lee Gross

Last Saturday night the Albany men’s
junior varsity basketball team chalked
up their ﬁrst victory against a com-
petitive Hartwick College JV team,
75-61.

This game showed an overall team ef-
fort both offensively and defensively.
With the help of Murphy Whalin‘s out-
side sharpshooting and Steve Jerymn
working the inside. the Danes put
together their first victory.

Although there was no actual turning
point in the game, the Danes really took
control after a technical foul was called
against the .Hartwick team. This led to a
slew of quick hoops, opening up the
game and allowing Albany to roll.

The victory was a big lift after the
tough loss to Hudson Valley in the

JV squad stands at 1-1

opener. Albany lost that game in the
ﬁnal minute due to a few mistakes,
68-64. However, after the victory over
Hartwick, conﬁdence has been restored
in this young Albany team.

Despite their l~1 record, the Albany
team is labeled a strong, competitive
and very well-coached team. The JV
team is made up of all freshman playing
together for the ﬁrst time.

However, after promising scrimmages
and hard practices, the team is playing
like they have played together before.
This was displayed in their last game.

While there are no true standouts on
the team, the JV Danes are gifted with
all talented and atheletic personnel.
When this is mixed with the coaching of
Coach Bob Beyer and Assistant Coach
Adam, there are good things in store for
Albany Basketball. D
