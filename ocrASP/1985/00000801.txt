Great Dane skaters whip Siena; fall to BCCC

By Olivia Abel

and Lisa Jacket

The Albany State hockey club ex-
perienced the thrill of. victory as well as the
agony of defeat this weekend.

After crushing Sierra 8-5 on Thursday,
they fell to Broome County Community
College, 6-3, on Saturday night.

The loss still can be used as an indication
of how the Danes will handle other tough
teams in the conference. Albany may have
lost, but more importantly, they were not
outclassed by Broome County.

“We had doubts about competing
against schools in the Division III league
which we have just joined this year." said
player Rich Diem. “But this weekend has
answered our questions - now we know we
can compete with and even beat these
teams.”

“We keep improving with every game
we play," said Albany State head coach
Bruce Pomakoy.

Despite their loss Saturday night to
Broome County, Pomakoy felt that the
team played an outstanding game. He
pointed out that Broome is number one in
their division, proving that Albany can
compete with anyone in the division Ill
league.

After trailing 2—0 at the end of the ﬁrst
period, Albany came out fighting in the
beginning of the second period in a display
of sharp passing to score three goals to
take a 3-2 lead.

Right wing Scott Ely scored first for
Albany with assists from Pete Leskody
and Dan Esler, followed by a goal from
Jim MacLear and Paul Essner.

Ely scored his second goal of the game
with less than two minutes left in the
period with assists from Larry Hartman
and Mike Mondiello. Albany then lapsed,
allowing BCCC to score twice to end the
period with a 4-3 lead.

Albany lost control of the game as BCC
put the icing on the cake with two more
goals.

“Despite the loss we played our best
game yet,” stated Pomakoy. “The desire
is there and they are just going to keep get-
ting better and better."

Broome’s coach told Pomakoy that
Albany would have won if Broome hadn’t
scored the last two goals of the second
period. Pomakoy also noted Jim
Leskody’s fabulous goaltending job Satur-
day night as well as Jim Ruggerio’s ex-

cellent job Thursday.

Albany and Siena battled it out Thurs-
day night, ending the first period with a tie
score of 2-2.

Playing more strongly and with intensi-
ty, Albany scored three more goals in the
third period to end the game with a victory
of 8-5. Albany’s goals in the third period
were scored by defenseman Kusak, Dave
Dalbek and right wing Leskody.

Dalbek’s goal was a tremendous in-
dividual effort as he went down one on one
with a Siena defenseman.

If you had earned a free weekend trip
to warm Atlanta, Georgia, would you
take it? Craig Parlato of the Albany
State men's cross-country team did just
that.

Parlato qualiﬁed for and ran in the
NCAA Division 111 Cross Country
championships held near Emory Univer-
sity of Atlanta this past weekend.
Would he do it all over again if asked?
Probably not.

Parlato’s race was summed up in one
word by head coach. R.K. Munsey:
“Disappointing”.

Parlato got on the starting line of the
grassy, hilly course with 183 other run-
ners. He came across the ﬁnish in 155th
with a time of 29:21.

“It was the worst race of my life,"
said Parlato ﬂatly.

This was Parlato's third consecutive
year in the nationals. In ’83 and ‘84 he
represented Albany State as part of a
team, and placed I45th and 70th
respectively.

 

Parlato falters in Atlanta 7

This year he ran for Albany State as
an individual. The Albany runners just
missed qualifying as a team this year,
but Parlato qualified as an individual
due to an excellent 11th place ﬁnish at
the NCAA regional meet on November
16th.

“At the regional' meets across the
country there was a total of 1,729 men
who lined up to qualify for nationals.
Only 184 of theseguys made it. No mat-
ter how he did, he still deserves respect
for being there." said Munsey.

Although he didn’t ﬁnish up strong.-
Parlato seems to be fairly satisfied with
his season.

“It was an accomplishment making it
to nationals, but I've had better meets
than that”, said Parlato.

Even though Albany State was not
represented at nationals. the quality of
their team can be seen in the quality of
the competition in the N.Y. Region.

Out of a field of 21 teams from eight
regions, the N.Y. region placed high.
Ithaca College took eighth, St.
Lawrence took sixth, and R.l.'l'. took
third.

 

 

Hartman commented, “The lines are
starting to play really well together. All we
need is a little more ice time and a few
more breaks because we can beat any team
in the league.”

The team is looking for defenseman Bil-
ly Abrams, who is out with a broken arm,
to return after Thanksgiving. Pomakoy
points out that his size and knowledge
have been sorely missed at the blue line.

The Danes have an upcoming game Fri-
day, December 6 against arch rival
Mohawk Valley at RPI.

Simon lost at I67 to Ed Muclhaust, 5-9,
but the Danes’ “murders row", the upper
weight combination of Pidel, Sabo and
Tironi, destroyed their Brown opponents.
Pidel defeated Kurt McDowell, 10-2, Sabo
pinned Eric Conti 47 seconds 'into 'the
match, and Tironi pinned Eric Wilenzie at
1:17.

“The whole match was exciting," said
DeMco. “It looks like we dominated it,
but we really didn’t. We overwhelmed
them in a way, but not from the
beginning."

“Arnie and John were the outstanding
wrestlers of the match,"'said co-captain
Fidel. "Arnie wrestled great, and John
was just unbelievable. Jake Sabo also, I
don’t think he wrestled more than four
minutes in all his matches combined."

The Danes wil face Boston University
on Wednesday, December 4. in a match in
which DeMeo believes Albany is the
underdog.

“They’re six-time New England
champs." said DeMeo, “and they beat
two of our stars in the Classic. Hopefully,
we're not going into that town for another
‘Boston Massacre‘. I’m more worried
about this match than I’ve been about any
other match in the past two years. ”

Great-Dane eagerstace RPI in opener Sunday

By Krlstlne Sauer

The Albany State men's basketball team
tips off its season this weekend in the
Capitol District Tournament at Union.

The Great Danes won the tournament
last year, but, with .only one returning
starter, whether or not Albany can match
that is up in the air. The Danes have lost
seven proven players since last year from a
team that went 22-6 and ended their suc-
cessful season in the first round of the
NCAA tournament in Worcester,
Massachusetts. '

Junior Adam Ursprung returns in his
third season starting for the Danes. Last
year the 6'4" small forward was the
leading scorer for Albany and was named
to the All-Conference team.

Joining Ursprung in the starting ﬁve is
junior Mike Cinquc, a transfer from

Aldephi University. Cinque looks solid in‘

the point guard position and adds his two
years of experience gathered from starting
at the Divison II Long Island school.

Senior John Mracek will start in the
center. He'll be aided in the frontcourt by
either returnee Tony Dickens or Brett Ax-
elrod, up from JV. Senior co-captain
Doug Kilmcr, the team’s best outside
shooter, will start at off guard.

Aside from Brian Kauppila. the other
senior co-captain, the Danes bench is inex-
perienced, which could pose a problem
throughout the season. Kauppila’s Value to

the team is evident in that he can substitute
in any postion.

On Sunday at 6 pm, the Great Danes
face RPI in the ﬁrst round of the tourna-
ment. RPI has already lost to the Universi-
ty of Vermont and played Columbia last
night.

The Engineers return with 10 out of 13
players from last year’s squad. Senior
Mike Gianniccini, a senior from Vermont,
is a returning starter at guard. He is joined
by Staten Island's John Walsh. a
sophomore, in the backcourt.

The team’s center is senior Jack
Mahoney. The forwards are senior Bob
FasSett and sophomore Rob Roesch.

“RPI is favored because of the quality
of the returning players," said Albany
head coach Dick Sauers, “but we’ll still
show up."

Immediately following this match,
Union and Skidmore play for a spot in
Monday night's finals.

Union lost three starters to graduation
from last year’s 16-11 squad. Two of
them, Ken D’Orasio and Kevin Bartlett,
were 1000 point scorers. They accounted
for at least 30 ppg, which is bound to be
missed.

“We lost a lot of scoring and reboun-
ding from last year said Union head
coach Bill ScanIon. “We are better defen-
sively this year. The big question mark is
from a scoring standpoint.”

Returning for Union are two sophomore

guards, Torn Beck at point, and Rob
Parento at off guard. 6'6" Mike Miller,
who is expected to start at center. is suffer-
ing with a hamstring problem. Ken Levine,
another guard, started in half of the games
last season.

“From a guard standpoint, we are fairly
solid,” said ScanIon. “The three we lost
were all front line players."

“Albany’s going to be tough. They still
have enough good players back," said
ScanIon. “Albany is pretty solid, and RPI
has enough people back.

Union’s opponnent, Skidmore, has two
returning starters from a 12-14 team and
has lost its two leading scorers.

Dave Sterns returns to start at the off
guard position, where he averaged 10.6
ppg last season. He is joined by 6'4" small
forward Jeff Jacobs, who averaged 13.4

P8-

Two of the other starters are set. 6’4"
John Molsworth is starting at strong for-
ward. He is a transfer form Syracuse. At
point guard is Bruce Fischer, a
sophomore. The other starting position is
up for grabs between 6’3" freshman Pete
Kestner, John Morsey and Brian Welman,
both measuring 6’7".

“If we could win the tournament, that
would be a good indication of how we’ll
do," said Albany's Kauppila.

The Great Danes follow up the tourna-
ment on Wednesday, Dec. 4 in their
SUNYAC opener at Cortland. [3

Women cagers dropa pair in opening tourney

By Krlstlne Sauer
SPORTS EDITOR '

The Albany State women’s basketball
. team’s attempt to upgrade its schedule
may come back to haunt them. The Danes
are 0-2 after losing both games in this
weekend’s Eastern Connecticut women’s
tip-off tournament.

While Albany wasn't able to come out in
the winner’s circle over the weekend
against the New England powerhouses, all
wasn't lost as the tournament proved that
they were in the right company.

After losing a close battle to E. Connec-
ticut, 72-68 in the ﬁrst round, the women
cagers missed walking away with the con-
solation game by a mere one point as Col-
umbia topped them 70-69.

“We have to look at the positive
things.” said Albany head coach Mari
Warner. “We played against two good
clubs. Eastern Connecticut was 5th in New
England last season and Columbia is
strong. We certainly didn’t get

outmatched.” -

With ﬁfteen seconds left on the clock
Albany was ahead 69-68 after Lori Bayba
sank two free throws,'but Columbia’s
Christine Tyer hit with a basket four

seconds later to lift Columbia over Albany _

70-69.

Albany called an immediate time out,
went into the game, was able to get a shot
off, but didn’t score.

The leading scorer of the game was Col-
umbia’s Ellen Bossert with 27 points. For
Albany, Bayba led with 20 points,
shooting 80 percent from the free throw
line. Guard Rainny Lesane followed with
15 points.

Against Eastern Connecticut in the ﬁrst
round the Danes trailed 38-31 at the end of
the first half. Albany found itself in a
worse predicament as the host team took
an 18 point lead in the final half.

The Danes rallied to within 2 points with
16 seconds remaining. After a critical tur-
nover E. Connecticut went to the free

throw line and scored two more to end the
game 72-68.

“We had the opportunities, we just
didn’t convert," reflected Warner.

Albany's scoring was well-rounded as
four players registered in the double
ﬁgures.

Lesane led with 15 points, sophomore
Cindy Densen followed with 14, then
Bayba and Diane Fernantis with 10 apiece.
High scorer of the game was E. Connec-
ticut’s forward Chris Donnell with 17
points. .

“The tournament points out real quick-
ly what we need to work on,” said
Warner. “The turnover situation is one,
another'is creativity in our offense. We're
not shooting nearly enough from the out-
side and our decisions to take the shots
aren’t good.”

Warner also said she was proud of the
way the team fought back when they were
behind. This is a position they shouldn’t
continually get themselves in.

“Another problem is with the intensity
of play not being considered throughout
the game," said Warner. “As a coach I
have to try to ﬁgure out what it is that gets
a team to play when they have to and what
it is that will make them play the entire
game that way."

The Danes went 23-4 last season and
were disappointed when they failed to get
an NCAA bid. That resulted in a beeﬁng
up of their schedule, adding this tourna-
ment and a few other tough opponents. In
the long run these two losses could hurt
their dream of an NCAA bid.

“1 would much prefer to start off like
this and build up stronger and stronger so
at the end of the season we are where we
should be,” concluded Warner adding,
“I'd rather find it out now and have time
to work on it."

The women cagers’ next game is on
December 2 at Skidmore at 7 pm. They
follow that with their SUNYAC opener at
Cortland on the 4th. E]

RA staff tops D-Danes 4-3 in wheelchair game

By Rachel Braslow
EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

Excitement raged through the
Albany gym Friday night as ap-
proximately 275 fans witnessed
the third annual wheelchair
hockey game.

A surprise visit by Channel 6
highlighted the game as the State
Quad staff squeaked out a narrow
4-3 victory over the D- Danes.

“It was much more aggressive
than last year”, said State Quad
participant Greg Ritucci-Chlnni.
“We ended up being taken by the
D-Danes."

Fifteen penalties were called
during the game, resulting in
players being thrown out of the
game. '

A new rule Initiated this year
was the extension of the crease.
This appeared to be beneficial
because there were not as many
collisions In the goallc's vlclnlty

“There were no really easy
goals," said Rituecl-
Chlnnl.“Pcnalty-wlrc. the bigger
crease payed off."

“The referees were very strict,
a lot didn't get by them. They
grabbed you for everything,” said
Ritucci-Chlnni.

Brian O'Grady scored the first
D-Dane goal during the first
period. Steve McCaffrey and
O’Grady both scored in the se-
cond period. ’

State Quad's Suzanne Anslow,
Aracelly Alvarez, and DeWayne
Chin scored goals.

“It was the closest game, it
came down to the wire," said D- ~
Dane captain Rob Plpia. “It was
a r0ugh checking game, It got
heavy in the second period. At the
end there was a lot of name
calling,”.

5700 has been raised so far
from ticket sales towards the pur-
chase of a van for the disabled.

This willnot be the end of play-
Ing time for the D-Danes. They
are trying to schedule three or
four games for next semester
against other colleges, Including
Hofstra and Nassau Community
College.
