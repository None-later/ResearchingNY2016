them the way it should be done,” said
Landis.

“Major people got to know the rules.
We just want you to know controversies
always come up because people aren’t
brought in," said Russo.

Not everybody was happy with the out-
come, however. “Central Council finally
got up to take a stand. We hollered, we

said naughty, naughty, but we said take
the money anyway,” said Bill McCann,
Central Council Chair. “If you're going to
make a point, you should have come out
behind it. i thought freezing the budget
would have done that," stated McCann.
Hartman pointed out, “By freezing the
budget you are hurting students who pay
their activity fees for these concerts.”
Afterwards Seligson said, "I understand

Council's situation. We did not blatantly
disregard the policy. We never heard
anything about it before."

Seligson said that UCB dicided to set
ticket prices at 320 because it has a better
psychological effect than $22. “The public
seems to buy the majority of the tickets.
By raising (ticket prices) out of the com-
petitive price range, we're hurting
ourselves," he said.

Bar owhers start stricter proofing  _ ,

By karen E. Back A 

EDITORIAL ASSISTANT ’ ‘ I
Students have had to hand over

more than SUNYA id when trying

. to get into bars this week as local

bar owners have beenvforced to
implement stricter proofing
policies while also seeking Ways to
cater to their under-21 patrons.

- “Just because a person is not of
age doesn't mean they can’t come
in here," said Joe Shairmonte,
owner of the Across The Street
Pub. “Peole can still come in to
eat, but if anyone in a group is
underage, then no alchoholic
beverages will be served to their
table." ,

Shasirmonte added that a max-
imum of six patrons would be
allowed a table after 8:00 pm.

“1 can't jeopardize my liquor
license or risk a possible liability
situation because I looked the
other way." saids Shairmonte.

“The set up of this bar is not
conducive to controlling both 21
and non-21 year old patrons,”
said Ron Howard, manager of the
Long Branch.

“Because we are in business to
stay in business. we will have to
insist on proper ID at the door,”
he said.

According to Howard, the
Long Branch has been using
“special flashlights” that help
bouncers in recognizing altered
lD’s, especially drivers licenses.

. “We have to do everything in
our power to abide by the law,"
Howard said.
Poger Martel, co-owner of the
LampPost and LP’s said that he
may plan some non-aloholic func-
tins next semester.

. “its too soon yet to tell just
how the 21 drinking age will
change our business,” said
Martel.

The LampPost also operates as
a restaurant, serving lunch and
dinner. “After 9 pm. no one
under the age of 21 will be allow-
ed through the door," daid
Martel. “Anyone under 21 com-
ing in before 9:00 for lunch or
dinner will not be served
alcohol.“

While all local bar owners plan
to strictly en force the 21 year-old
drinking age, many of them dais
they feel the new policy is unfair
to them as well as to 19 and 20
year olds.

“l was definetely opposed to
the raising of the drinking age to

tainly not the panacea everyne
thinks it is. it's obvious that kids
are going to drink anyway," he
said.

indirectly. it is held in an account
at Norstar Bank, Zahm said.
Norstar buys commercial paper
from Associates Corporation of
North America and ClT Financial
Corporation, said Muriel Levine,
secretary to the senior loan officer
at Norstar. Associates and ClT
are leading companies which bor-
row money by issuing commercial
paper.

ClT is a wholly-owned sub-
sidiary of Manufacturers
Hanover, said Pat Foster, ClT's
Manager of Public Relations.
This means that Manufacturers
l-lanover owns all of ClT’s stock,

“What is going'on is a neo-
prohibitionist attitude which is
prevalent throughout the nation
as well as the state," shairmonte
said. I

“The legislative took an emo-
tion rather than a rational ap-
proach to the problem," said
Howard. “1 think they want to
ban alcohol cxompletely,” he
added.

This is a social problem that
our society must address ap-
propriately,” he said. “The ‘band
aid’ approach, like. raising the
drinking age and limiting the
amount of time bars can remain
open, is not a solution," he said.

“LStatistlcally, the problem

“We’ve sectioned off the bar
part of the Rat," said Me-
Clure,“to make sure that 21 year-
olds don't give drinks to underage
students.”

“LSO far, the only problem
with this , has been that last
Wednesday a lot of people came
to dance on disco night. but they
couldn't,” said McClure.

McLClure said that The Rat

in addition to a SUNY'ID. f‘The
