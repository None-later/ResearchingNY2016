O’Leary addresses kegban, safety on WCDB

By Sarl Selken

Students took the opportunity
presented by WCDB 91 PM this
past Tuesday to question Univer-
sity President Vincent O’Leary on
issues as diverse as the new keg
ban and campus safety.

The program, during which
O’Leary fielded twenty-four
questions, was a special edition of
the WCDB 91 FM Public Affairs
program.

not to allow students to have kegs
and beer balls,"vhe said.

“There will be this policy as
long as there is a law. There will
be amendments in the future. We
don't know what will happen. We
will find out," O’Leary said.

Callers also voiced concern
over the upgrading of campus
safety systems. “An example of
how we operate now is if the
Women’s Safety Tast. Force

“There will be this policy as long as
there is a law.”

— Vincent O’Leary

 

When asked why he requested
the phone-in session, O’Leary
said, “Every year i meet with
students and this year we decided
to be more systematic.”

Several questions revolved
around campus alcohol policy.
“We are not going to set up rules
around the students' rooms. It's
not that we don't care what goes
on in the rooms but we aren’t go—
ing to strip students of their
privacy. The key issue is that
students cannot expect to have
their privacy invaded if they are
reasonably well-behaved,"
O’Leary said.

When asked about the recent
ban of kegs and beer balls from
students’ re )ms, O’Leary said,
“it had noth..ig to do with the
‘21' policy. There was a higher
level of drinking amongst
students and more damage
happening."

The administration decided “to
let students have enough sense to
conduct themselves in their own
rooms [students can have parties
in their rooms] but we decided

makes a proposal for lights to be
put in, then we put them in," said
O'Leary.

“Right now the campus is
equipped with seventeen poles
with blue lights on them. These
are emergency telephone systems.
if you need assistance then that
will put you in touch with Cam-
pus police. We have submitted
our plans and i would be
delighted with more funds,”
O’Leary said.

The theft of Business School
exams was also addressed by stu-
dent callers. “Faculty as well as
students are upset. We want a
place where there is dignity and
humaneness. We should be less
concerned about reputation and
more concerned with a statement
about ourselves," said O'Leary.

Students were not allowed to
get on the air and ask questions
directly of President O’Leary.
Calls were taken by the WCDB
staff and the questions were writ-
ten down and submitted to the
interviewers.

"We covered a lot of ground”

Chesnut, who moderated the pro-
gram, said there were two reasons
for this policy. “Technically,
there would be a seven second
delay between questions and this
would disrupt the flow of the pro-
gram. Secondly, we group the
questions according to topic and
we don't want the Same questions
repeated. it's more logical this
way," he said.

University President Vincent O’Leary

 
 

Questions were censored, said
Chesnut, “in the sense that we
didn’t use the same question
twice.”

Other issues that concerned
students were the mice present in
some of the dorms, student ac-
tivism, the University policy on
AIDS, and the new dormitories to
be constructed across Fuller

Publicity for the phone-in pro-
gram was done through promo-
tional announcements over the air
as well as posters spread around
the campus, said Chesnut.

At the end of the program
O’Leary said, “we covered a lot
of ground. This is the most effec-
tive way. We should do this a cou-
ple of times a semester." El

Chanukah at. ﬁlls cc Lobby

By Hilary Fink

STAFF WRITER

To brighten up this year's Chanukah the Jewish
Student Coalition (JSC) brought food, gifts. and a
festive atmosphere to the Campus Center lobby

Wednesday.

According to Rabbi Jay Killman, JSC's advisor,
there were three purposes behind the planning of a
the Chanukah fair., “One was
awareness of Chanukah to the Campus community.
The second was to promote JSC awareness, and the
third was to promote general Jewish awareness
through the various Jewish items that were being

sold.”

Chanukah is the celebration of the Jew retaking
the second temple from the Greeks. An oil lamp, or
menorah, was discover in the temple; the lamp had
enough oil for only one day, but it burned for eight.

“1 think this is a very good idea because i don’t
have time to shop and run all over,” said Sarah
Herman, ak doctoral student her, “My Sisterhood
book shop isn't open when i have time to go. This is
very handy. in Albany, it is hard to ﬁnd lChanukah
things. You have to go to a temple to ﬁnd them."

Albany resident Binah Bindeli heard about the
fair and came to look around. “This is wonderful
for the students and the community. it increases the
awareness of the holiday,” she said.

“items to sell came from synagogues, Jewish
organizations, the bookstore downstairs, and even

Peru.” said Kellman.

"A lot of time was put in to see if everything was
set and all of the merchandise was here. i think it
turned out very well.” said JSC President Elliot

Frome.

“A lot of long term work was put into it. it took
a tremendous amount of effort to put it together.”
This was “the first time the Campus Center lobby
was givern over in its entirety to student organiza-
tion. This also gave us n opportunity to promote
our individual groups," he added.

Jewish items included Menorahs and candles,
Chanukah "gelt." dreidels, jewelry, Chanukah
wrapping paper, and Jewish books. Lambswool

to promote

sweaters. gloves, and hats (all hand-made), Swat-

ches, stuffed animals. gourds, rugs, and blankets

were also sold.

The msience _of all minority
and single religion fraternities at
SUNYA is not only allowable

'despit'e Universityrules against

discrimination, but such groups
are ;aiso welcomed, according to
Student Association and ad-
ministration ot‘ficials . v

Fraternity members also say
that much of the homogeneity of
their groups results from students

I phoosin'g'to be with their friends,

and not because of discriminatory
policies. j ’ ' ‘

‘ “when fraternities started at
Albany, bands of pre-existing
friends formed together," said
Aaron Geller, a member of Zeta

Beta Tau (281'), a predominantly

Jewish fraternity.

To establish a local chapter

fraternities must sign a non-
discriminatory clause and both
local and national fraternity con-
stitutions cannot discriminate
against prospective members. The
local chapters, however, have the
ﬁnal say on admitting members.

This ban “removes temptation
for illegal discrimination to come
into the picture," said Jessica
Casey, Director of Student Ac-

tivities and administrative liason

to campus fraternities.

“The activism of the 60’s and
70's lessened the fervor of starting
fraternities," said Casey. “Only
the minority fraternities existed,
the others died off,” she added.

Fraternities start to become un-
diversified when “some have con-
stitutional pupposesvappeaiing to
a narrower constituency then
others,” she said.

While campus—fraternities may "

not discriminate against
members, new members join for
speciﬁc reasons.

The reason students join frater-
nities “is to meet people that are
somewhat similar with similar in-
terests, pledge master for Alpha
Epsilon Pi (AEPi). AEPi’s na-
tional reputation as a Jewish
fraternity has attracted many of
its members, he said.

Howie Sonnenschein, Presi-
dent of ZBT, disagreed saying

that “Religion has no part in '

pledging. Rather, it's the reputa-
tion of the frat and the people in
it."

AEi’i President Rob Segal said
that while AEPi is a predominant-
ly Jewish fraternity, “members
chose AEPi because their friends
are in it. You want to be around
your friends," he said.

New members are admitted,

however‘,‘based on‘ their qualities
“as a human being," said Mitch
Cohen, a Pi Lamda Phi member,
“not on their religion. One of the
main reasons we don't
discriminate is everybody had

their" choice of fraternities," he

added. ,-
Larry.Wasserman, a member
of Sigma Alpha Mu, explained
that the fratemity's large Jewish
membership is because of “the
way this school’is." The fraterni-

'ty, he said, is "making their best

attempt to integrate. Why would
you not want to experience people
of other backgrounds. if you live
your life in a shell and hang out
with one group, it’s a waste," he
said.

it’s advantageous to integrate.

fraternities, said Byrnes
Chatelain, President of Kappa

,Alpha Psi, which started in I980.

if a fraternity is not integrated “it
becomes a military-type of thing,
there is not democracy.” Kappa
Alpha Psi’s membership includes
approximately 75 percent Afro-
Americans and 25 percent
Hispanics.

Hugh Davis, President of Phi
Beta Sigma, disagreed saying that
“there is not particular advantage

to integrating fraternities, but
ther is also not clear cut advan-~
tage to being an undiversified
fraternity. While Phi Beta Sigma
is a predominantly Afro-
A'merican "fraternity. 'ther are
sev'era'l- members ot‘. other
backgrounds." '
Minority fraternities are impor-
tant, said Casey, because “with
any minority, Greek or not, it
provides a_ network of support
that works better for the majority
and often minority needs are
crowded out by the majority."
“it would be terrible with no
national Jewish or minority
fraternities," said Student
Association Vice-President Ross
Abelow, the SA‘ liason to inter-
Fraternity Council. “Any frat can
help minority goals, but minority
frats can be a little stronger,” he
said.
“As long as every frat is allow-
ing everybody to join 1 don’t
think you should have-one black
fraternity, one Jewish one, etc.,"
said Michael DelCorso, Theta
Delta president. Whele Theta
Delta is an integrated fraternity,
“some minorities that wanted to
join couldn’t because of ﬁnancial
difﬁculties.” he said.
