CampusrepubliCanssplit over prof monitoring

By Ilene Welnsteln
ASSOCIATENEWS EDITOR

A proposed merger of two cam-
pus Republican groups has been
rejected by the College
Republicans in part because of a
condition requiring the monitor:
ing of professors for “liberal”
tendencies, according to SUNYA
College Republican President
Steve Korowitz.

One of the main conditions in
the Young Republican Club’s
merging proposal was, Korowitz
said, that the new combined
group would consider keeping a
list of professors who teach from
a certain political bias.

The idea of monitoring pro-
fessors was brought up by Bruce
Weinfeld, President of SUNYA's
Young Republican Club, during
negotiations for the merger. said
Korowitz. Weinfeld had been in-
spired by the nationwide Ac-
curacy in Academia (AIA)
organization, said Korowitz.

AIA is a watchdog group which
began this fall to monitor
classrooms across the country for
“leftist” professors.

Monitoring professors was one
of the main conditions of the
merger, agreed Robert Schmidlin,
Campus Affairs Coordinator for
SUNYA’s College Republicans.
He said that Weinfeld had admit-
ted to him twice over the
telephone in the last two weeks his
plans to make a list of professors
who teach from a biased
viewpoint.

Weinfeld, however, denied the
claim that one of the conditions
for the merger was the proposed
monitoring plan. He said that
negotiations betwcn the organiza-
tions had started two to three
weeks ago and that it was up to
the College Republicans to accept
the terms offered by his group.

Weinfeld said he believed
monitoring professors was a good

idea to ensure non-biased educa-

tion. Many professors at SUNYA '
teach from a particular political

bias without giving the other side,
said Weinfeld, although he refus-
ed to comment on specific
professors.

Members of SUNYA’s College
Republicans, however. did not
agree with the idea of monitoring
professors because it “is not a
Republican thing to do. It would
be irresponsible of us students ot
tell people who have been in
academia for 20 years that they
are wrong,” said Korowitz.

Speaking of professors,
Korowitz said, “Most of the best
people on this campus we later
find out are Marxists. it's not
right to place a limit on these peo-
ple." Conservative professors, he
added, are mostly “coming out
against monitoring. A university
is supposed to be a place for the
free exchange of ideas," he
said. Weinfeld will be stepping
down from his position as presi-
dent lo accept the post of Ex-
ecutive Assistant to the President
of the Federation of New York
State Young Republican Clubs, to
which the SUNYA chapter
belongs.

SUNYA’s College Republicans
belongs to the NYS Federation of
College Republicans, which is a
branch of the Republican Na-
tional Committee.

Brian Kelly, President of the
Federation of New York State
Young Republican Clubs, said he
knew nothing about the College
Republicans' rejection of the
merger proposal. nor of the idea
to monitor professors.

As' a citizen, however, Kelly
said that he would turn over any
list of alleged Marxists that he
received to the federal authorities.

According to Korowitz. the
merger plan was also rejected
because his organization was not

informed about Weinfeld’s pro-

‘n'ioti'on. f‘lWasnot fold the cem-

plete story of [Weinfeld’s] posi-
tion after the merger and '1. have
made my views of Bruce clear. He
ignores the'concerns of the Col-
lege Republicans," he said.
“Brian Kelly is very confused
about what is going on right
now,” said Korowitz. adding that
Kelly gets the information about
the negotiations from Weinfeld.
“Bruce [Weinfeld] is lying

through his teeth,” he said.

A merger between the two
groups would cause an “aggrava-
tion of personality clashes.” said
Schmidlin.

SUNYA’s Young Republican
chapter was formed this semester
by Weinfeld, who said the second
Republican group formed
because of "difﬁculties not on
issues but on the ways of getting
things done." Personality con-
ﬂicts also played a role in the

split, he said.

Now that he is stepping down
as president. Weinfeld said he felt
that it was time to resolve the dif-
ferences between the two groups.
“They were trivial things.” 'he
said.

if the two groups combined
they could do a lot more, stated
Weinfeld, who added that the
Young Republicans had not been
very active on campus lately. E]

COLLEGE PRESS SERVlCE —- Accuracy in
Academia, the ideological watchdog group that
began hunting for “liberal” professors earlier
this fall, has begun to name names and, accor-
ding to some. to apply pressure on administrators
to rein in--if not ﬁre~the professors.

in its first newsletter, AIA accused Arizona
State political science Prof. Mark Reader of us-
ing his classes to espouse his views on nuclear
weaponry.

AIA then sent a letter complaining about
Reader to the ASU administration.

AIA National Director Matthew Scully says
AlA will be naming three more allegedly-leftist
professors in its next newsletter. which the
organization distributes to 5,000 people and
organizations.

Though Scully refused to name the three
teachers AIA will charge mislead thier students.
College Press Service has learned that Mary
Karasch, a history professor at Oakland Univer-
sity in Michigan, will be one of them.

Scully estimated there are 10,000 leftist pro-
fessors working on American campuses today,
and reports classroom “monitors"--anonymous
students who inform AIA of what they perceive
as leftist teachers--have already turned in the
names of about 100 instructors since the program
began in September.

plaints) are valid," Scully said.

So far. ASU has stood behind Reader, the lone
professor named publicly.

“There have been no reprisals against
Reader,” said Brent Brown, Arizona State's vice

 

 

AIA accuses first ‘liberal’ prof

' “I would assume a good number (of the com- '

president of community affairs. “He is a
respected member of our faculty."

“The administration has come out on my
behalf, fully and completely," Reader affirmed.

Brown added there’s been no reaction from the
state legislature, either. During the McCarthy
Era in the early 19505, state legislators sometimes
threatened to slash college funding if the college
refused to ﬁre professors with whom they
disagreed. “I don't see any indication of any
pressure to muzzle our professors” Brown said.

“We are very pleased with the response of col-
lege presidents," said his Molotsky of the
American Association of University Professors
(AAUP), which at a national meeting last week
passed resolutions condemning AIA.

“We don’t think professors are above
criticism. it’s the methods [AIA uses to monitor
lectures]," Molotsky explained. “What's really
disturbing is that they are enlisting students who
won't reveal their identity," he said.

The implications of what AIA is trying to do
worry Reader. “It’s absolutely frightening."

“One step leads to another. McCarthy started
by labeling people Communists, but then some
of them lost their jobs," Cal-Davis administrator
Bill Antaramian observed.

“This is what was done in Nazi Germany.
Students did this for Hitler when he was getting
started,” Antaramian added.

Scully contended AlA’s objective is merely to
“make free and open debate," on views exposed
by leftist professors. [:1
