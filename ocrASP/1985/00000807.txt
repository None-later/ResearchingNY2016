Henderson spreads ‘veganlsm’ gospel

By Ken Dornbaum
sormnm. assrsrm .

While working on his doctoral
dissertation at SUNYA, Bruce
Henderson. a graduate student in
the English Department, has
busied himself with. among other
activities, running marathons,
organizing the Graduate Students
E m p l o y e e s
Union (OSEU),
writing a novel
and promoting

Friday
the second edi- P ratlle
tion of a book

he wrote on veganism.

The book, Oakland Organic: A
Vegan Primer. is a book “written
for city people — people in a
dorm room or apartment only
need expertise with seeds, and
how to sprout them," said
Henderson, referring to indoor
gardening. “The focus of the
book is on organic living,” he
said. adding that the book took

_ three years to research.

A vegan is someone that
doesn't use any animal products
— no meat. poultry, ﬁsh, dairy
products or eggs." said Hender-
son. “l'm happy just eating fruits
and vegetables.” he added.

“l‘m not macrobiotic,” he
said. “People need to ﬁnd for
themselves what kinds of
vegetarian they should be. For ex-
ample. I rarely consider eating
protein, like a whole avocado.
Rather. i eat a‘ fév’v peanuts, or
tofu or wheat grass juice."

it’s been eight years since I've
been a vegan and ten years that
l’ve been a vegetarian." Hender-
son continued. “I did have the
phase where i gave away my
leather clothes. Now i don't think
it’s a moral issue."

“What’s wrong is with the
supermarket, the processed food.
l regard them as dangerous.” he
said. “You’re taking chances with
processed. polluted foods, hor-
mones and anti-biotics. i don't
think eating meat is wrong. it's
the processing," he added.

“At this point l’m not in-
terested in any meat. if you eat
light, you stay light," he said.

“if your whole body is
digesting for ﬁve or six hours.
you're lethargic —— the after
Thanksgiving dinner syndrome.
Eating a lot of protein is hard on
your body."

“Last week i was carded in
Nyack, NY. They thought i was
under twenty-one; I was born in
1948." he said. “By eating a light
diet, your body rejuvenates," he
added.

Henderson said he has run
several 26-mile marathons and
just recently ran a 9-mile
marathon in Schenectady. “l
have no energy problems," he
said.

“The book is in lots of local
stores, including the Book Hut in
Stuyvesant Plaza and Barnes and
Noble,” he said.

“The first edition of the book
— 500 copies —— sold out. and on-
ly half of this run of 1,000 is
left," he said, adding he co~owns
the publisher. Caboose Press.

Henderson is also a campus
organizer of the OSEU. a union
for graduate students. “This
Monday we’re going to hearings
of the Public Employees Rela-
tions Board (PERB)."

“PERB will determine whether
we [graduate students] are really
state workers.” said Henderson.
“if we’re recognized. we wil
negotiate a contract."

Among the conditions that
caused Henderson and others to
organize was “how arbitrary your
work is. Some grads don’t have
job descriptions." Henderson
said. “Some get stuck teaching
two classes or are forced to pro~
ctor without pay. it’s happened
this year in the‘ bio department,"
he said. "

“The thing is we have no health
insurance. In my department,
there's no xeroxing, arbitrary job
titles and...ultimately the students
suffer." he continued.

“if you overwork and under-
pay grads and don’t provide them
with support services. then their
work suffers." he said.

“When i was doing my masters
in English in Seattle, a professor

had students scrape the barnacles
off his boat," he said. “The
unspoken agreement was either
do it or you don't get your ‘A’,
dissertation passed, etc," he
added.

The situation isn't like this at
SUNYA. “but the potential for
abuses are there.” he said. “if
there is a union for grad
assistants, this could never
happen."

Henderson is also working on a
novel he describes as' about “a
love triangle between two lesbians
and a man. This situation left me
a lot of possibilities for plot. it
left me with the idea for interper-
sonal voodoo."

“It's a positive novel," he said.
adding that he may have to

publish the novel himself. “Fic- ‘

tion markets are hard when you
don’t have a name for yourself."

Review of study space underway

By Leslie Chait

STAFF WRITER

Finals week is fast approaching. and since
November 25, specific spaces have been set aside
for students to use for studying. These areas will be
available until December 20. the last day of exams.

Since last year there have been a “few minor
changes," as far as study areas go. said lvan
Edelson. Special Assistant to the Executive Vice

President for Academic Affair.

All quad cafeterias will be open from 8 pm. to 6
a.m. for students' use, while at the uptown quads
the penthouse and various lower lounges will be

availabe 24 hours a day.

For Alumni residents the Brubachcr Main
Lounge and Ballroom will be reserved for studies 24

hours a day.

The library will have extended hours on Satur-
day, December 14 from 8 am. to 11 p.m., while LC
l9 will be open from 8 u.m. to 6 am. daily and LC
22 from 10 pm. to 6 a.m. through December 20.

Campus Center lounges and cafeteria will be
open during building hours. while the Bio Seminar
Room 248 will be open weekdays from 6 pm. to IO
p.m. except when scheduled for classes.

Some of the changes include the Humanities
Lounge, Room 354. This year, the lounge will not
be a part of the study space that is available because
the “Loung Cmmittec. headed by Jeffrey llcrman.
is rc-cxamining the use of the lounge. it will be now
used for lectures and quest speakers." said

Edelson.

LA second change involves the Physics Seminar
Room. [Due to a conflict in scheduling uvliability,

Despite continued predictions
of large—scale cuts in federal
ﬁnancial aid programs, only ten
students showed up at a campus
forum Wednesday to learn about
the latest proposals regarding and
thr'eats to student aid.

The Higher Education
Reauthorization Act(HERA) and

the Gramm—-Rudman amend- ‘

ment both may affect the level of
ﬁnancial aid the federal govern-
ment will disburse in the future.
said speakers John Amann,
Higher Education Project Coor-
dinator for the New York Public
Interest Research Group, and
Donald Whitlock. SUNYA’s
Director of Financial Aid.

“There is pressure to reduce
government’s role [in people’s
lives] in general,” said Amann.
“The idea is that some people
have to sink or drown. just like in
the ‘good old days.‘ ’3

According to Whitlock.
students must deal with potential
changes in the ﬁnancial aid
system through congressional
leaders.

“Individual letters make the
largest impact.” he said. “If you
bug them long enough, you’ll get
their attention.“

“The Higher Education Act
can create programs, decide .how
programs can be implemented.
and authorize different funding
levels,” Amann i said. “Basically
it can do everything."

‘ The Higher Education Act of
l965 must be reauthorized by
Congress every five years, and

. .. modifications to.the act are cur- ,-
‘ rently being- considered by Con-

gress. The act will come up-next
year for reauthorization.

The Gramm—Rudman bill is
an amendment to a federairspen-
ding bill being considered in Con-

‘ various

m -- uuwwws :.

gress which would callrfor regular
cuts in federal spending until a
balance budget is attained in
1991.

The amendment threatens a
variety of federal programs
because some programs would be
subject to automatic cuts if Con-

gress does not meet preset levels -

in the future. Funding for ﬁnan‘
cial aid programs. said Amann, is
among the areas to be cut.

NYPIRG at SUNYA Higher
Education Project Leader Rob
Davis said he expects the Sewnate
and the House to reach some
compromise on the
Gramm—Rudman bill and even-
tually pass the legislation.

Accoding to Stacey Young.
NYPlRG at SUNYA Project
Coordinator, the amendment is a
“stop—gap measure" to reduce
the federal deﬁcit. The bill, she
noted, was not in the original
budget bill.

Amann said the Gramm—Rud-
man amendment will most likely
be approved in some form, but
added that Congress could repeal
the measure later. “However. we
don’t want to see it go that far.”

Although only about ten peo-
ple attended the forum. both Am-
man and Davis said they felt the
turnout was good. “Having it

[the forum] a week before finals.

and days after a vacation didn’t
help." said Davis.

Davis said he doesn’t unders-
tand why students aren't more in-
terested in the financial aid issue.

in the future. NYPIRG will
have to better publicize forums to
draw student interest, he added.

NYPlRG has focusedon using .

letter—writing campaigns at
campuses. and has
organized protests at
SUNY—Cortland and
SUNY—Binghamton, Amman
said. noting that the Cortland ac-

Despite‘fears of aid cuts, only 10 show at forum

tion drew over 200 students.

According to Whitlock. the
Reagan administration has used
false propaganda in its attempt to
cut aid programs. As an example,
Whitlock said the administration

 

. claimed that over 13,000 students

receiveng student loans came
from families with income over
$100,000 per year. The cases.
Whitlock said. were investigated
and the actual number turned out
to be thirteen.

. Director of Financial Aid Donald Whitlock

“If you bug them long enough. you 'll get their attention. “

 

Whitlock expressed hope that
the ﬁnancial aid programs will
not be seriously affected by the
current proposed legislation.
“They [the programs] will not go
down the tubes badly — if people
mobilize." he said.
