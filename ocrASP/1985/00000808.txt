Let’s march tor‘aftirmative‘acti‘on, not aloohOI

It was the front page story of the
November 26, issue of the Albany Student
Press. it made a thunderous roar across
the podium. it was so big a media event
that it prompted Steve Gawley, Student
Association President, to don a suit for the
local TV news.

Five hundred protesters turned out, “if
the weather was better we might have had
2000," said Gawley. What was all the
noise? Why were the students so enraged?
You’re not going to believe me, but the
answer is alcohol. Yes, alcohol. The
masses turned out to protest the new
University Alcohol Policy. l have never
seen a larger, nor louder protest on this
campus.

I did not know alcohol was that impor-
(am. All of this causes me to wonder. I
wonder if the mass of the crowd. is as
aware or concerned about several other
more prevalent issues. '

The foremost issue in my mind at this
time is the Reagan Administration‘s
systematic dissolution of Affirmative Ac-
tion programs. This has been a quiet issue,
no noise, and worse — no news. Every
now and then, someone will bring it up,
but sice it gets little or no media coverage,
not much is known about it.

This proposal, could deal a devastating
blow to minority opportunities across the
nation. What would make it more
devastating is if we don't see it coming.
The details are hard to get, (more scarce
than the coverage it‘s received, perhaps).
However. it is imperative that we find out
as much as possible, so that we can voice
our concerns.

Beyond The
Majority

By E. Paul Stewart

 

Affirmative Action was designed to br-
ing about equity and promote opportunity
for the minorities and women who have
been historically neglected and
discriminated against. The program in-
volves making available employment and
educational opportunities previously unat-
tainable by these groups. The Reagan Ad-
ministration can not be allowed to show
such blatant disregard for the program and
people that it serves.

Here is a brief list of some of the actions
taken by the Reagan Administration:

April, 1983 — Due top pressure from
the Justic Department, the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
reversed the stand it had taken in a New
Orleans lawsuit involving affirmative ac-
tion policy in their plic department. Initial-
ly, the EEOC had prepared a brief, which
ws changed to state “the position of the
Justice Department would prohibit all af-
firmative action programs designed to
open job opportunities for minorities."
The pressure they received caused the com—

take advantage of a resource that
potentially could benefit them in
terms f final grades and learn-
ing,” said Edelson.

Edelson said he hopes
“students make use of it. Ifl were

that l could find a quiet place to

El

mission to reverse its decision of support
for the program. Thus, the Reagan Ad-
ministration via the Attorney General's
Ofﬁce was usurping the power of the
EEOC. (Incidentally, the population of
New Orleans is 55 percent black.)

June, 1984 — Following the Supreme
Court decision which set limits to Afﬁr-
mative Action, the Justice Department at-
tempted to overturn a federal court ruling
that barred thje Cincinnati Police Depart-
ment from laying off or demoting minority
ofﬁcers. The ruling was made in an at-
tempt to maintain a racial-community
equity in the city.

12.2 percent of President Carter's full-
time professional appointments were
Black. President Reagan's — 4.1 percent.

16.1 percent of the Carter Administra-
tion Federal judicial appointments were
Black. President Reagan’s — 2.5 percent.

Black United States Attorneys ap-
pointed during Carter’s Administration
totaled 6.9 percent. Under President
Reagan —— 1.1 percent.

With these facts alone and more
developments pending, it's obvious that
the time was yesterday to start rallying for
answers and for a change. Is the Central
Council Student Action Committee work-
ing on it? 15 Student Association Executive
Branch? 1 don’t know. What I do know is
that they should be. So should
A.S.U.B.A., Pan-Carribean, Fuerza-
Latina and all the groups whose members
will be affected the most.

Then (since it’s probably too late for this
semester) we can rally next

 

worthy cause.

Perhaps Frank Pogue, arid“ Vincent
O'Leary will rally with us ahd Steve
Gawley can put on a suit again and we’ll
get even more media coverage.

We can’t afford to sleep on this; per-
chance to dream for answers. WE have to
make the changes. For in the sleep we take
while afﬁrmative action dies, what dreams
may come?

Happenings

This weekend is filled with cultural hap-
penings. Pan-Carribean Association starts
us off on Friday at 7 pm. in LC 2 with a
panel discussion. The tonic is
“Rastafarian — A Crazy Cult or a
Way of Life?" There will be several
university representitives and yours truly
will be moderator.

Following the discussion will be the film
“The Harder They Come” starring Jimmy
Cliff at 9:30.

On Saturday, December 7, PCA will
sponsor a Cultural Variety Show, featur-
ing a fashion show, reggae. dances and
dramatic skits. That will be a 9 pm. in the
PAC Recital Hall on the 2nd floor.

Capping off the weekend, Albany State
University Black Alliance will recognize
Kwanza, an annual Black Cultural event,
in the Campus Center Ballroom from 6-10
pm. There will be an explanation of the 7
principles of Kwanza, as well as other
culturally pertinent activities. For more in-
formation on both ASUBA and PCA's up-
coming events call 442-5678.

 

 

Maybe we'll get an even larger crowd than
the alcohol issue, since this is a more than

said Edelson. “Even if we start
with a small amount of space,
we'll see if we want to continue it
and expand it more." he added.

No time to read

Scheduling conﬂicts and state regulations requir-
ing a certain number of class sessions are responsi—
ble for SUNYA's lack of a Reading Day this
semester. 1n the past a one day period has separated
the last day of classes and the beginning of final
exams.

“The calendar policy is a balancing act. The
policy is set by the Educational Policy Council, a
[University] Senate Council," said Fred Volkwein,
Special Assistant to the President at SUNYA.

in creating a calendar for the academic year, he
said, “Our highest priority is having it begin after
Labor Day and ending before Christmas. Our se-
cond highest priority id the Jewish Holy Days. our
third priority is Reading Day and our fourth one is
State holidays,” Volkwein explain r .

“There is a Reading Day in th. Spring, 1986
calendar because there is more room,” he added.

Sediment closes pool

The University Pool was closed Monday and
Tuesday, according to SUNYA’s Aquatics Director
Dave Turnage. The pool's water heater was not us-
ed over Thanksgiving break, and, he said. when it
was turned on "some sediments or some sort came
out into the pool."

Turnage said that he did not believe the pollu-
tion, which turned the water brownish—green, pos-
ed a health hazard, but the pool was closed anyway
so that the pool could be cleaned and vacuummed
for safety's sake. .
