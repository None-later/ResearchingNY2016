Debate Team successful despite lack of funds

By Rob Berke

Although SUNYA's debating
team ranked fourth of 46 in their
last tournament, financial dif-
ficulties may prevent the group
from participating in an upcom-
ing national competition.

Members of the Speech and
Debate Society were finalists in
six of the 15 categories of debate
and won eight trophies at the
Russell Martin Individual Events
Tournament at Cornell
University.

The team finished behind
Brown University, SUNY Platt-

in the poetic interpretation.

Erika Lobet. competing for her
first time in the impromptu
speaking category, won sixth
place. impromptu speaking is one
of the hardest categories to par-
ticipate in because the contestant
has only seven minutes in which
to prepare and deliver a speech,
said Sepanski.

Both Alan Rafterman and
Michael Altman were in the ﬁnal
round of the After Dinner Speak-
ing category. taking sixth nd third
place respectively. Sepanski said
that it was their ﬁrst time com-

peting in this category.

Sepanski said she hoped the
University will be more aware of
the Debate Society as a result of
the teams success in the
competition.

“We want the university to
know that we’re representing
them,” said Mundie.

Another result of the team's
success is that prestigious schools
are now aware that Albany has a
speech and debate team, Sepanski
said. “it’s very noticeable and
very important," she said.

Both Mundie and Sepanski

agreed that the success had an
enlivening effect on the team’s
spirit.

According to Mundie,
SUNYA‘s team is among the best

.in speech in the Norteast, which

he said was something to be
especially proud of since the team
has no coach. “You can’t
underestimate the profes-
sionalism and intensity of the
competition,” he said. Having a
coach to handle the arrangements
and logistics would take unec-
cessary pressure off team

members, he added.

The club's previous competi-
tion was not as much of a succuss
as this last one was, said White.

debate competition, held at
Southern Conneticut University
the team’s debate. ranking drop-
ped from thirteenth to sixteenth
in the Northeast region.

The Speech and Debate Society
at SUNYA is a member of the
American lForensic Association
(AFA), a nationwide debate and
speech organization. [1
