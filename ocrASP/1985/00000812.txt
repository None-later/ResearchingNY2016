soéber (so’bér), adj.

Characterized by self—control or sanity;
reasonable; rational.

 

 

SOBER IS SMART. Now is the time
to start thinking about drinking in a
whole new light. Drinking doesn’t make
you cool. It’s not a guarantee of success.
It’s not: even a prerequisite to having fun.
The fact is booze doesn’t really get you
anywhere. Think about it.

A national trend towards older college
students is being felt at SUNYA, according
to data published by the University’s Of-
ﬁce of Institutional Research. Most of the
older students, however, seem to be taking
their studies on a part-time basis. V.

In the 1984-85, academic year 4.2 percent

of SUNYA’s full-time students were over '

.the age of twenty-ﬁve, as compared to 62
percent of the total that were part-time
students.

Almost 6 percent of these students were
over forty-ﬁve, but these ﬁgures represent
those men and women who entered the
university as matriculated students, as op-
posed to students taking courses not for
credit.

“Many peopIe have a

stereotype that these
students are
housewives with
chiIdren. ”
—— Kathy Winchester

 

The figures, the data shows, increased
with statistics concerning the non-
matriculated students of the same range.
Of the total number of non-matriculated
students almost 43 percent v .te between
the ages of twenty-three and thirty.

The large number of non-matriculated
students in the 23-30 age range is due to the
fact that most of the 18-22 year olds have
come straight from high school and
therefore have already matriculated into a
speciﬁc program, according to Kathy Win-
chester of the Continuing Studies Office.
Many older students need to accumulate a
grade point average before they are able to
enter a particular program.

Winchester also said that approximately

thirty-ﬁve to forty percent of these people
are those with bachelors degrees who take
courses in order to prepare for graduate
school or to meet a requirement for a par-
ticular graduate program. " _

“Personal enrichment. job enhance-
ment , and preparation for graduate
school" were several examples Winchester
gave as to why older students return to the

Arlington. Va.
(AP) The typical college student-~18 to
22 years old who's living on campus and
taking courses full time-~is no longer
quite so typical.

A group of educators and govern-
ment, union and corporation ofﬁcials
who ended a two-day conference two
weeks ago said the country’s education
system has to adjust to that little-knowh
reality.

About 40 million Americans take
post-high 'school courses. Of that
number, about 12 million attend col-
leges and universities, while the rest
study or take on-the-job training
through their companies, unions or at
informal learning centers.

Many at the conference agreed that
changes are needed to make sure that
government aid and educational plann-
ing take the new composition of the na-
tion's student population into account.

“Many people have a stereotype that
these students are housewives with
children. But there are many, many dif-
ferent types." Winchester continued,
“Education [to these people] is an interest
and now they need a bachelors degree to
enhance their jobs.”

Winchester, however, also mentioned
I

Adult students changing college seen:

Some of the most basic changes have
to occur in the public’s perception of
adult education, they said.

“We have to make it plain that it is a
perfectly normal part of American life
to go back to school when you're
older," said Frank Newman, president
of the Education Commission of the
States, which represents education of—
ﬁcials across the country.

Several of the conference participants
said providing better education for
adults is essential for the country’s
evolving economy.

“As technology changes, we’ll have
to train people repeatedly," said
Michael Goldstein, counsel to the State
Higher Education Executive Officers
Association. “We do an adequate job of
training people the first time out, but we
don’t have the facilities in place to
retrain them now," he added.

Those at the gathering, sponsored by

that the number of non-matriculated
students was down from last year. “But
these ﬁgures do not reflect the amount of
students who entered the matriculated pro-
grams,” she added. Actually, over half of
the matriculated students were between the
ages of eighteen and twenty-four; she
stated.

the private Commission on Higher
Education and the Adult Learner. spent
their time examining a shift in the com—
position of the nation’s student popula-
tion that they say the public has yet to
notice.

Government figures show that of the
l2 million college and university
students. 60 percent were 24 or younger
in 1982, and 58 percent of them were
full-time students.

But the federal Department of Educa-
tion has projected that 55 percent of
them will be 24 or under in 1987, and
just 50 percent will be that age by I992.

"Little by little, a bigger percentage
of our formal education system is in
adult learning,“ said Newman, a former
president of the University of Rhode
Island. “But so much of our focus is on
the conventional student that we haven’t
yet recognized we have to do a better job
on adult learning." El
