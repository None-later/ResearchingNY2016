Strong performances by Lisa Op-
penheimer and Nancy Neverett helped the
Albany State Bowling Club’s Women’s
team to maintain their ﬁrst place standing
in the Tri-State Conference as they ﬁnish-
ed ﬁrst at last week's meet in Worcester,
Mass. Meanwhile, the men’s squad, com-
ing off their best performance of the
season at the SUNYA, Invitational the
previous week, continued their clutch scor.
ing as they ﬁnished fifth out of the
13-team ﬁeld.

Although the women keglers. ﬁnished
ﬁrst in a tournament for the ﬁrst time this
season. their consistent second place
finishes have kept them atop the Tri-State
Conference standings. Oppenheimer's 218
game and ‘538 3-game'series, along with
consistent scoring by team members .ludi
Israel, Cyndi Carpenter and Neverett con-
tributed to he 14-4 win over the University

Neverett’s performance was enough to
give her the ﬁrst place singles trophy, and
she beat out teammate Oppenheimer for
all-events champion by a score of 1018-997
over six games.

On the other side of the lanes, Mark
Mackler shot games of 201, 188, and 235,
and his 624 triple helped the men’s team to
a 22 1/2 - 44 1/2 win over host school
WPl. Also chipping in for the ﬁfth-place

finish were Ken Schwartz, Eric Troelstra,
Steve Spezza, Mark Weinman and Mike
Small. The men keglers then took 15 of 27
points from the Coast Guard in the
doubles competition.

This past week, the ﬁve men and ﬁve
women who will represent SUNYA at the
ACU-l Bowling Tournament in Rochester
on, February 14-16 were determined by
qualifying at Campus Lanes. The men’s

captain, Steve Silva, will be joined by
Mackler, and three members of a Sunday
Night mixed league team, Scott Stickler,
Carl loss and Rick O’Connor. The
women, led by Andrea Miller, will also
send Robin Steinberg, Neverett.
Carpenter, and Oppenheimer. A 184
average over 12 games was required to
qualify for the men's team, and a 148
average over six 3. mes for the women. Cl

 

 

JV Danes defeated by Williams; record drops to 1 -2

By Lee Gross

Last Tuesday night the Albany men's
Junior Varsity Basketball team was
defeated by Williams College by a score
of 47—45, dropping their record to 1-2.

Albany was leading the game at half
time by a small margin. However, this
lead didn't last. 1n the second half
Albany became lackadasical, “it was as

Scott Jeryman doing the inside work
and Kelly Kimbrough playing all around
ball. Unfortunately, it was too late,
Albany brought the score to within 2
points, which is where it remained. as a
last second shot by the Danes went for
naught.

This was a tough loss coming off such
a decisive victory over the competitive
Hartwick Team last week. The Danes

upset in our minds.”

The Danes have to look past that
game and get ready for the tough
schedule ahead. They have to get ready
for their rivals Rl’l whom they play
Monday at home. The RPl team is a
tough competitive team with a lot of
height.

This could be a big victory to lead
them into the Ft. Montgomery Com-
