By Mike MacAdam

ASSOCIATE SPOR TS EDITOR

In their SUNYAC conference
opener on Wednesday at Cor-
tland. the Great Danes trounced
the Red Dragons 98-70.

Albany’s fullcourt press rattled
the Cortland team from the start.
By halftime the Danes were ahead
51-33, ﬁnishing off the half with
the last ten points.

The press resulted in 16 Cor-
tland turnovers in the first half
and 26 for the game. Five minutes
into the third quarter, the Danes
were ahead by 30 points. giving
HeadCoach Dick Sauers a chance
to clear his bench.

The Danes were led by
highscorers Adam Ursprung. with
18 points. and Doug Kilmer with
17. Ur‘sprung shot 9 for 12 from
the ﬂoor for his 18-point con-
tribution. with 12 in the first half.

Kilmer was deadly with the ball
in his hands as he sank all seven
of his baskets. For the first time
this season he was able to
capitalize on the three point shot
as three of his baskets were within
that range. which is approximate-
ly 20 feet away from the hoop.
