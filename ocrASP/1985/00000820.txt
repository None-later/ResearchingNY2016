SA foregoes ’86 Guiness Day

By Rob Berke

There probably won’t be a SUNYA listing in the
Guiness Book of World Records next year - the result of
Student Association's decision to not hold another record
breaking event this coming Spring.

The need to promote non-alcoholic programming in
light of the 21 year old alcohol purchase age and ﬁnancial
considerations are to blame, said SA Programming Direc-
tor Betty Ginzburg.

Last April over 4,500 SUNYA students played a four
hour game of Musical Chairs in the Administration Circle
to out the school in the Guiness Book.

Ginzburg said that her time will instead be spent help-
ing 80 student organizations change from alcoholic to
non-alcoholicevents now that the legal drinking age is 21.

“The decision was made for a few rcasons...onc was
ﬁnancial," said Ginzburg. “SA lost a great deal of
money, but it was a very proﬁtable event...it was wonder-
ful for the school spirit," she said.

Last year's Guincss Day cost SA between ﬁfteen and
twenty thousand dollars when it wasn't supposed to cost
anything, said SA president Steve Gawlcy, adding, “it
was worth the money, we just can‘t afford it again this
year."

Although Notrc Dame broke the record SUNYA set
last year playing musical chairs, “their record has not
been confirmed with the Guiness Book yet," said Ginz-
burg. Our record and a picture of the event are in. the
latest edition of the record book, she added.

Ginzburg said she thought it would be more detrimen-
tal to school spirit if she neglected the more than 80
groups "facing a total change of programming," due to
the higher drinking age.

“As‘far as school spirit is concerned, programming
isn’t tho-only area where school spirit is built. ..people 
ﬁnd school spirit in the athletic department," said Ginz-
burg. Shc said that would be a priority of Mark Rivers,
the chair of the intercollegiate Athletic Committee.

Despite gripes,

 

w. .Most students polled complained about Marine

by a smooth transition to non-alcoholic programming
spring semester rather than just one spectacular event,"
Ginzburg said. She said she is planning programs for next
semester that include a gambling ﬂing, a carnival, weekly
comedy nights, and Jcll-a-Jump, where contestants
would try to ﬁnd a small object on the bottom of a pool

“It is a major priority of the programming ofﬁce to
build school spirit on this campus," Ginzburg said.

Gawlcy said he thought Guiness Day would be feasible
in the future if sponsors who would make commitments
to find the event could be found. “The priority is the pro-
per’usc of the activity fee.” he said.

Break plans include work, play

By Pam Conway
ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR

While many students are looking
forward to interscssion as a break
from their classwork and ﬁnals,
most are also planning to spend their
vacations working to earn extra
money for school.

Michael Steinberg, a first year stu-
dent from State Quad, said that he
plans to spend his break doing
“nothing exciting. l have my old job
back and 1’" be working in Carvcl to
make some extra money.”

Kevin Driscoll, a sophomore from
Dutch Quad, also plans on working.
“i will be doing some carpentry
work for a friend and working at a
grocery store," he said.

Besides his jobs, Driscoll said that
he also intends on going out to relax,
but because of the recent rise in the
drinking age, he will have to “drink
with my friends around the house."

Junior John Evans, a resident of
Dutch Quad, is not affected by the
new drinking age because he in 23. “i
will be going home for a few days
but i will be coming back to work at
a bar here in Albany," he said.

Ellen Silvcrman, a first year stu-
dent who lives on State Quad, also
said that much of her vacation will
be spent working. "1 have a job in
the city working for a law ﬁrm," she

said.

As far as her social plans are con-
cerned, Silverman said she plans to
spend time with her boyfriend and to
go dancing. Although underage, she
said she will still go out drinking
because she likes to go to New York
City. “They don’t proof hard
there," she said.

lntcrsession, as well as being a
break from the pressures of school,
is a time for students to catch up
with their friends and families.

Rob Berke, a sophomore, said,
“I’m planning on seeing some of my
old friends, which should be in-
teresting since the last time l’ve seen
them, one has been to prison and
another has gotten tattocd."

A junior who lives off—campus
said she is looking forward to "cat-
ching up with the news since
Thanksgiving and hanging out with
my friends."

A ﬁrst year student from Indian
Quad said that she is also planning
on taking a trip. "l’m going to spend
four weeks in the Poconos skiing
and basically bumming out," she
said.

Also planning to travel is Universi-
ty President Vincent O'Leary, who
will be “going to South America to
return a visit made here by nine
presidents of Brazilian universities,"

he said.

“1 accepted the invitation and
hope that the trip will further the
Brazilian—SUNY exchange pro-
gram.” said O’Leary.

O’Lcary said that he also plans to
be busy doing other things such as
completing the move into his new
house, reading some books, and
“getting the Jets into the Super
Bowl.”

James Wrafter, a junior, said that
he doesn't intend on being quite that
busy. “l’m going home and doing
absolutely nothing," he said, ad-
ding, “l’m going to go to bars and
such, and 1 may go to some
concerts."

Many students said that over in-
tersession they will see for the ﬁrst
time how their local bars at home are
responding to the new drinking age.

Maureen McClosky, a first year
student, said “1 don’t know if they
are going to be in strict as they say
because they need the business."

McClorky said she is also planning
to cum extra money by working at a
supermarket. -

Michelle Colletti. a junior, rumm-
cd up her plans for intercession by
saying, “The only thing l'm plann-
ing for 1: working for my Dad.
visiting my boyfriend and trying to
get into bars." D

Marine Midland
is favored bank

By Cralg Wodman
STAFF WRITER

According to a random sampling compiled by Stu-
dent Association, 65 percent of SUNYA’s students use
Marine Midland Bank, but many are dissatisﬁed with
the service.

The poll, conducted by the Student Community
Committee, was undertaken because “We heard a lot
of complaints so we wanted to do a survey to get pco-
pic's opinions," said committee co-chair Irwin Weins-
tein. About 500 people were polled.

The results of the poll seem to indicate that although
many people do patronize Marine Midland Bank, most
are unhappy with the service.

In response to the question “Would you consider
changing if an alternative were available?” 85 percent
of Marine Midland customers surveyed answered
“yes.”

The most popular reason people use Marine Midland
is because, “it’s both at home and here. it‘s conve-
nient," Weinstein said. But, “the (moneymat'ic)
machines themselves aren’t as available as Key
Bank’s," he said.

Lynn Livanos, also a committee co-chair agreed,
saying, “Students are cornered into using it because it's
really the most convenient bank on campus," she said.
But, "There's a general feeling of people not liking
Marine Midland...(We’ve) found a campus wide
problem."

Midland’s coats, service, and unreliability. Amont the
list of grievances were the 30 cent per check and the 20
cent charge per balance inquiry at a moncymatic
machine.

Seventy - one percent of those polled, found the ser-
vice charges unreasonable. Also, “Most students seem
to feel that the machines are usually broken or out of
money." said Livanos.

Some comments from students on the survey includ-
ed “Serviccs that Marine Midland offers are offered at
other banks for free. i only use Marine Midland for
convenience.’ ’

Another student wrote,“(l have) bounced checks
due to the long period needed to clear a check.”

“i feel it isn't justiﬁable that l have to pay for the
use of my bank, l'm providing them with business," a
third student replied.

"i don’t think they tell you about the charges before
you open the account," said Livanos. “ironically
enough, my checking account is called a ‘Good Deal’
checking account," she said.

Another common complaint was that Marine
Midland branches herc in Albany have different
charges than branches downstate. “Because of the high
population of students they take advantage of this and
make charges that Marine Midland doesn’t make at
home, there’s sort of a monopoly," Weinstcin said.
“Students want to be equal partners," he continued.

The Student Community Committee plans to pro—
pose a resolution to Central Council to send the results
of the survey to Marine Midland’s central of ﬁcc. "_Wc
basically want to make a statement to Marine Midland
that we’re not satisﬁed with their services. There's a

general feeling of discontent,” said Livanos. 5’
