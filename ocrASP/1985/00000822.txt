Little interestexpressed forcon-servativerYAF .

With a bumper sticker stating “Support
Nicaraguan Freedom Fighters" hanging
on a blackboard Monday night, Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF) held
its first meeting at SUNYA although only
nine students showed up.

According to Rich Schiotis, a senior at
SUNYA and YAF’s chair, the group tells
“the right side of the political story...and
is very conservative."

“At this point, we‘re SA recognized, but
we want to see about funding and see how
far that goes."

According to Student Association (SA)
President Steve Gawley, funding of groups
includes only educational, social and
cultural group. “If they're political,
they're not eligible for funding," he said.

“At present, I’m funding the group out
of my own wallet," Schiotis said, denying

that he is receiving fund from the National.

YAF organization.

Schiotis said he has also been involved in
other conservative groups on campus. “I
was chair for a short while of the College
Republicans. chair of Students For Reagan
and I was advising and helping STAFF

(Students Against Forced Funding) last,

year," he said. STAFF attempted to stop

mandatory student funding of- the New.

York Public interest Research Group
(NYPIRG).

“YAF has already formed a ‘Stop.

PlRG’ committee, and we’re also forming

“It’s frustrating to be
a conservative on this
campus. The liberal.
viewpoint is
predominant. ”

' —ch11 Schiotis

 

a committee on ‘Peace Through Strength',
" he said.

“Our main emphasis is education. There
is no conservative view on campus,”
Schiotis said. “It's frustrating to be a con-
servative on this campus. The liberal view-
point is predominant. I hope our group is
an effective reply," he added.

“YAF differs from the College

Republicans with issues. We’re non-
partisan and .we won't, endorse anyone for
elections," Schiotis said. ‘

“National YAF has voted for the
legalization of pot. They're libertarian,"
said Mike Goetz, a member of YAF. “The
government doesn't have the right to con-
trol one’s activities —— that's the libertarian
line,” he said.

“ YAF is not
conservative-libertarian,”

restrictive, it's
Goetz said.

‘ “It's not there for prayer in school, but

definingthe role of government — deliver-
ing mail, etc., not with personal things like
wearing seatbelts,” he added.

“We’re not going to have much to do
with the national group,” said Schiotis.
No one from the national YAF has con-
tacted SUNYA’s group, he said.

“I'm working this campus. That's it,”
said Schiotis, adding that National YAF
was founded in l960 and is associated with
William F. Buckley. Buckley is a noted
conservative author. -

Among the projects YAF plans next

.semester is education about the

Nicaraguan contras.
“We support the contras and want to
present a different point of view,” said

 

Schiotis. “I'm not sure how we're going-to
do this, but we want to educate people on
the communist threat,“ Schiotis said.
“YAF is deﬁnitely anti-communist,” he
added.

“Also, if there's a contrary viewpoint
about apartheid, we'll present it. As far as
South Africa being anti-communist, we
don’t want to see the communists take
over," Schiotis said. “I see that as the big-

‘gest danger in the whole divestment

issue,” he added.

Schiotis said he also plans to bring Craig
Rucker to campus to speak about the anti-
PIRG movement. Rucker, a former
SUNYA student, was involvedlin-STAFF
last year.  ' '

“PIRG is'a first amendment issue," said
Schiotis: “No 'one' should be forced to
fund a political group,” he said. *

Schiotis said that YAF was not going to
be a continuation of STAFF. “We have
had a semi-YAF group on campus" for a
while, he said.

Schiotis said he was not disappointed
with the turn-out at Monday's‘meeting.
“it was a formal meeting with no issues.
Next spring we’ll be doing'better," he said.

Rastafarian way of life seen as more than a M"

By Rob Berke

Rastafarians transcend the im-
age of long-haired cultists and are
working to make their ideals of
world peace and social reform a
part of their everyday lives, accor-
ding to speakers at last Friday’s
panel discussion on
Rastafarianism.

Twenty-one students attended
the discussion sponsored by the
Pan-Caribbean Association as
part of Tropicana '85, a “wckend
of cultural awareness." Five
speakers were originally schedul-
ed although three cancelled prior
to the event.

“I cannot see a movement with
such profound impact on
Jamaican society...being referred
to in the context of a crazy cult,"
said speaker Dr. Kenneth Hall.
Assistant Vic Chancellor for
Academic Programs at SUNY
Central and a native of Jamaica.

The second speaker, Godfrey
Smith. said,“lt has established
itself in the middle of the people
and even nationally." Smith is an
award-winning writer of the
Caribbean Report in the
magazine Southend Scene and
also a native of Jamaica.

Both panelists accepted the fact
that because Rastafarianism has a
religious element it could be con-
sidered a cult. However, “It is
also a social philosphy, an
economic philosophy...it at-
tempts to define a people," Hall
said.

Smith called the movement im-
portant because it provides a
cultural identity for those people
who lack one.

Hall explained that the move-
ment was born in Kingston.
Jamaica in the 1930‘s among the
deprived black population living
in an urban setting. The corona-

tion of Haile Salassie. the king of
Ethiopia, gave hope to the pro-
phccies of Marcus Garvey, the
founder of the movement, who
instilled a wish to return Africa to
the Rastafarians, Hall said.

This. said Hall, is central to the
religious part of Ras'tafarianism.
The belief that they are in exile
and will someday return to Africa
is the motive of the Rastafarian,
he said.

“They're serious people," said
Smith. “These people really do go
back to Africa," he said. Some of
the sects even own land there, he
added. “They're not all smoking
and getting high," Smith said.

As for the smoking of the
'wisdom weed', Smith said, “it is
the weed that gives them
wisdom....it gives them relaxation,
musical satisfaction..." Neither
panelist connected the use of
marijuana with the religious
aspects of Rastafarianism,
although Smith pointed out that
the weed was supposedly found
growing on Solomon’s grave.

Religious Rastas read and
believe in the Bible, particularly
the Old Testament, explained
Hall. This. he said, is ironic since
many Africans are rejecting the
Bible because they say it is
destroying their country.
However. they continue to accept
the Bible since Salassie was a
Christian, he said.

“The Rasta man believes that
he is a part of the bible and the
mistake was letting the white man
interpret it for them,” said E.
Paul Stewart, mediator of the
discussion.

Reggae music, which is the
music of the Rastafarian, aided in
the cultural acceptance of
Rastafarianism since it was an
outlet of the creative energies in
the black community, said Smith.
Smith added that the late musical

artist Bob Marley did a good job

of making Rastafarianisn't an ac-
cepted way of life since he was
handsome and talented and broke
down barriers of discrimination.

The movement, said Hall,
which started in the lowest social
classes, offers opportunity for
employment, social mobility, and

~upliftment through the concept of

redemption. As unemployment
rose, so too did the social accep-
tance of Rastafarianism, Hal
said. '

Today, the Rastas aren't
necessarily poor. said Smith, ex-
plaining,“each age group of
Rastas has different attitudes and
temperament. i think it's a way of

life because of its ability to ex-'

ist...they are very progressive.”
“Everyone is a Rasta," Smith

said. “There are white

Rastafarians who believe the

whole concept...wake up one day

and say 'I am a Rast man’,"
Smith said, adding that one must
also prove himself worthy by
reading the Bible, not eating
pork, and following other parts
of the lifestyle. .

“Initially. one has to recognize
that Jamaica is a Babylon and he
is here against his will and even-
tually he will go back to Africa,"
said Hall, explaining how one
becomes a Rasta.

“Not every dred a Rastahand not
every Rasta a tired." said Smith,
referring to the long, braided style
of hair ,worn by some
Rastafarians, and commonly
thought to be synonymous with
the movement. Dredlocks have
been justiﬁed biblically, but both
speakers said they saw it more as
a form of social protest.

Students attending the discus-
sion said they felt the forum was
important because it helped break
down the misconceptions people
have of the Rastafarians. Accor-
ding to Sheryl Brightly, a
sophomore who attended the
discussion, “When people don't
understand a culture, they tend to
criticize it. ”

Following the discussion,
senior Hugh Davis summarized
his feelings about Rastafarianism,
saying. “it’s deﬁnitely a way of
life." I]

STAFF WRITER

Several students. along with the
Student Association Legal Ser-
vices ofﬁce, are seeking to
establish a forum through which
complaints about the University
Police Department can be heard
and evaluated.

An increase in the number of
students claiming to- have been
mistreated or harrassed by cam-
pus police this semester has
created the need for a committee
to handle such complaints and to
seek solutions to'reoccurring pro-
blems, according to Student Ac-
tion Committe Chair Larry
Hartman.

Hartman cited two recent ex-
amples of cases which he said
were “blown out of proportion"
by the police ofﬁcers involved,
resulting in the unnecessary har-
rassment of students.

In one incident Hartman said, a
transfer student was playing with
Ninchuks, a martial arts weapon,
which is legal in some places but
not on campus. when he was con-
fronted by a UPD ofﬁcer.

The student was handcufed by
the ofﬁcer and “given a big has-
sle" in a situation that could have
been handled with a little more
discretion, said Hartman.

In another incident, Hartman
said a student was going door-to-
door on one of the Quads trying
to get people to vote on election
day and was accused of stealing a
toaster oven. The student claims
he was threatened and generally
mistreated by UPD ofﬁcers until
it was discovered that the toaster

oven had been borrowed by a ‘

' n'Eighbor, said Hartman. »

The committee also plans to -

send copies to University Aux-
iliary Services (UAS) who
negotiates the contract with banks
who operate on campus. “if
Marine Midland wasn’t here, I'd
say their business would drop

significantly because people walk ‘

in here and see it," Weinstein
said. .

Another factor against the
bank, said Weinstein is that
“Marine Midland has in-
vestments in South Africa, I
believe pretty heavily. At Buffalo
State, the students entirely pulled
out of Marine Midland because of
this." .

According to Weinstein, the
Student Community Committee
wants to improve the services pro-
vided to students. “We have to
cater to downstate people, which
are the majority here...so we need
Marine,Midland," he said.

Livanos agreed saying, “it
would be hard to ﬁnd an alter-
native which would cover the
geographic area (that Marine
Midland does) but we want to br-

' ing about changes in Marine

Midland's attitudes toward
students." El

UPD, their only option is to sub-
mit a written report to the UPD,
said Hartman, with no guarant
of action. '
Hartman encouraged students

' to call SA with their complaints

so that problems can be
monitored and dealt with in a
positive way.

Hartman emphasized that the
idea of a complaint task force is
in 'no way intended to be an at-
tack against UPD, which he said
plays a necessary role on campus.
Rather, it would be intended to
improve relations between
students and the police by pro-
viding a channel through which
complaints could be openly
discussed, and solutions propos-
ed, he said.

The task force, is currently in
the planning stages. said Neil
Garﬁnkel, President of the Pre«
law Association, and one of the
students involved in formulating

UPD complaint forum eyed

the task force. The groundwork is
being laid, he said, though neither
he nor anyone involved has
discussed the idea with ad-
ministrators or the Department of
Public Safety. V

The proposed committee would
be ‘made up of administrators,
faculty, UPD officers and
students, and could be in place by
as early as next semester, he said.

SA president Steve'Gawley said
that the reason that the task force
would not become active until
next semester is because it had
"not been properly formulated
yet.”

Gawley added that several
other student groups, such as the
Student Community Committee,
have expressed interest in par-
ticipating in the task force.

“it (the task force) would be
designed to help out students and
cater to students needs," said
Hartman, "and apparently, there
isaneed for it." CI
