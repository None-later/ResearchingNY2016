most effective route to conquer-

yourself in the anxiety-producing
situation. Working through the
anxiety by studying even while the
exam is making you nervous and
making sure to arrive on time for
the exam and staying until you’ve

much of the stress and can over-

Bible promoted as remedy for homosexuality

BY KenuDornbaum
EDITORIALASSISTANT

Christianity and the bible can .. 3
help save gays from the sins of
homosexuality, according to four
speakers at a religious seminar
held Friday night entitled “Can
Homosexuals Change?"

About 40 people attended the'
seminar held in St. John’s
Lutheran Church in downtown
Albany. The seminar was spon-
sored by The Bible Speaks, a
Christian. non-denominational,
evangelical church * group in
Albany and was conducted by
Living in Freedom. Eternally
(LIFE).

According to Pastor Dale
Walker of The Bible Speaks,
LIFE is a one year-old ministry
from New York City whose
members are ex-homosexuals and
who are now Christians. “The
group reaches out to homosex-
uals,” Walter said. adding that he
is trying to organize a LIFE group _
in Albany.

The major purpose of'LlFEv is
to spread the knowledge that
homosexuals can change, said

Walker, “some people say they

‘ Can’t change, but they can,'he
.d . . ,.

“ eople want to change for

, many reas_ons,”, said Walker.
' “Most people do not make a cam '

scious choice . to be. ‘gay. Pro-
homoSexuals search-for biological
proof that they’re born that way,
but it’s not true," he said.

“God didn’t :make‘ anyone
homosexual, but he did make

people heteroseitual,"'- M‘alker, ». I
said. “God .makes- people’imanyv-f

things“ they} donjt"~want' to‘ be.

Some women.,ard-.f‘rigid,- and ‘.-it i
may not be God's plan,“ he said. -*

 “For homosexuals, thereis a
time in early childhoodhdevelop-
ment that determines (sexii'ali-
ty).” he‘said. “In the treatment
we ,go back and discover what
went wrong.”

Among those who attended the
seminar was Joe Norton, a retired'
SUNYA professor of counseling
psychology. “I attended because I
have personally counselled gay
people and his (Walker’s) ap-
proach sometimes leads people to
suicide,” Norton said. According

to Norton. there were four
speakers, three‘ men .and one
woman, all of whom were gay
before' joining the ministry.
Speaker Joanne Highley, Norton
said, is the wife of the head of the
ministry, Rev. Ron Highley.

‘ Highley said, “Homosexuality
drives people to lying, stealing,
cheating, and murder," accor-
ding to Norton. “She couldn’t
support any of this and later said
that theg-devil leads people to do
those and also "to homosexuali-

gty." said Nortoné‘

f'Walker said thatishe (Highley) ,

was misunderstood and that she
did not mean homosexuals are all
of those things. '

“Research shows that most ex-.

gays think sexuality is so bad that

'they engage in no sex at all," Nor-

tonsaid.

“My basic point is they’re
stressing sin and this makes peo-
ple hate themselves and we should
use the Bible to help people to
love themselves," he said.

The speakers also made several
misleading statements about
AIDS (Acquired Immune ,Defi-
cieney Syndrome), said Norton.

“The AIDS Council people
vehemently countered them on
AIDS. The speakers said AIDS

came from bestiality. They had ‘

no response to how children got
it," said Norton. “They also
couldn't respond to the fact that
only 37‘ percent of people with
AIDS in the Capital District are
gay.

Walker said he was not sure
how many gay people were in the
audience, but he did say that at

' least one SUNYA’person called
and expressed ' interest in the

seminar. . . v.5,-

 Walker also mentioned that
Highley was ' featured on the
Donahue show this past Monday
morning.

“Ithink that there were a lot of
people interested, but very few
who would come," said Walker.
“The Church, in the past, has not
shown God‘s love to homosex-
uals," he said.

Tamara Richman, co-chair of
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
(GALA), said she feels that this
ministry adds to homophobia.

“‘I think that this sort of pro-

paganda leads to mentalities such
as ’Rape the Lesbian' to cure her
and to the horrors of the
psychology institution (which
treats homosexuals) with' shock
treatment and aversion therapy."
she said.

Richman explained that aver-
sion therapy is “the showing of
pictures of the same sex to gays
and lesbians and if they were
aroused they shock you until you
are no longer conditioned to res-
pond to members of your own
sex,” she said.

“The whole thing that bothers
me is that it is even an issue," she
continued. “I don’t think
homosexuality needs to be chang-
ed. It’s a natural lifestyle-why
question it? Heterosexuality can
be changed and no one questions
this," she said.

“As for advice to the SUNYA
student who went, I want to say
that any sort of therapy that pro-
claims itself to cure someone of
homosexuality can only change
over symptoms of it,” she said,
adding, “it can't change what’s
deep inside of him.”

tion Act in 1965 —- and host of
the national 'anniversary
ceremony on November 7-8.

Hardesty said critics of the
Higher Education Act are
“elitists” upset that too many

sionists” who are wrong to say
the act was never designed to send
poor students to private schools,
or “thinly-disguised racists" who
mask their prejudices with a' pro-
fessed concern for educatidnal
quality.

“There is some truth” to the
notion the programs diminished
classroom quality,” said Terry
Hartle of the American .Enter-
prise Institute, “but what we’re
seeing are some second and third
generation problems. The thrust
of the 1965 law is not
threatened."

Minnesota's Hearn said it's
“naive” to attribute academic
troubles to financial aid, adding
he thinks any decline in educa-
tional quality results from a com-
plex mix of factors.

Even critic Gardner stops short
of saying financial aid is a
primary cause of lower quality,
claiming instead there is .“a
strong probable connection" bet-
ween the two. '

Still, Gardner — and probably
the Reagan administration —— are
determined to convince Congress
to use the reauthorizatin debate
to make it harder for students and
colleges to get federal money.

Some obsuvers, for example,
expect Bennett to propose that
students maintain higher grades
in order to get and keep federal
aid. .
Lewin of Pierce College, who
supports the idea. estimates
anywhere from 25 to 50 percent
of the students who now get aid
would lose their loans and grants
if Congress agreed to it.

The same critics have failed to
convince Congress to approve
cutbacks and similar changes in
the last three years, but Gardner
thinks the administration, could
win this time if it sticks to its
principles. “
