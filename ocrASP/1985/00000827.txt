By Michelle Sliverstein
An alternative Christmas gift store has
opened for the second consecutive year in

what its organizers say is an attempt to .

h'elp deprived craftspeople in third world
countries while also protesting U.S.
foreign policy objectives. ,’ '_

Peace Offerings, advertising “unique
gifts from around the world" is located at
221 Central Ave. in the Social Action
Center, and will be adding a touch of Holi-
day spirit to the neighborhood until the
week after New Years. >

A wide selection or gifts-is offered, in— "

cluding educational books, holiday cards
and ornaments. south American weav-
ings, African baskets, Indian batiks and
more. . '

The gifts are made by hand, and with
care, said Marcie Shcmaria who runs the
store. “Giving gifts that were made with
care embodies the Christmas Spirit," she
explained.

The board games that are sold are non-
competitive, and teach children how to
work with one another to attain a common
goal, Shcmaria said.

Shcmaria said that “these games teach
children to help one another." In one
game, all of the children must perform cer-
tain tasks so that they may harvest their
garden.

The Third World Shop stems from an
idea conceived in the 1970's at a UN con-
ference in Europe, Shcmaria said.
UNICEF is one of the major funders of
this shop, she added.

Carolyn Blackmann-Miroff,..a Masters
in Social Work Candidate at SUNYA said
that she appreciates UNICEF because she
knows that "they deliver to the right peo-

Help is on Its way

According to Robin Johnson, adviser,
Purple and Gold delivered approximate-
ly 1,000 survival kits to the five quads
on Thursday night.

Off-campus students whose parents
ordered survival kits for them can pick
the kits up at the Student Association
Contact Office.

Flyers were sent home to parents ask-
ing them to order the kits for their
children. The year's sales of 1,000 were
up from 722 last year, said Johnson.

The kits include munchies and a note
of encouragement from home written by
the parents on the order form.

Some of the proceeds from the sale
will be put towards buying a new Great
Dane mascot costume for the Universi-
ty. The kits were sold for 38.

Students can help

Operation Crossroads Africa, Inc. it
seeking students to participate in com-
munity development programs in Africa
and the Caribbean.

The projects are sponsored by
Crossroads and the governments of the
involved countries. They involve
medicine, nursing, community develop-
ment, archeology, architectural
photography and agriculture.

People intrcstcd in applying should
write to Crossroads Africa, l50 Fifth

Lawsuit still on hold

Student Association lawsuit against
the city of Albany concerning the
Grouper Law is “still on hold" accor-
ding to S.A. attorney Lou Oliver.
“Right now we have an injunction
which protects the accused violators
from being evicted until a final judg-
ment is reached," Oliver said.

On November l4, a court hearing
was held to decide whether or not a

 

‘ but not always, indicative of the judge's

Alternative X-mas gift shop
captures true spirit of givingi

pic at the right time. They sell nice crafts to

help nice people.” i ‘

I, Peace Offerings is a fund-raising project
for the. Social Action Center. and buys
items on consignment from local groups

and local native American groups.

Shcmaria said that "by selling Native
’American Crafts we can repay them the in-

justices that have been done in the past."

She stated that “we have taken so much of
their culture from them, and this is a way

to preserve some of what remains.”

,The- Social Action Center attempts to
combat much of what they see as social in-

justice, including organizing against in-

justices sgainst women, legbiansmndfgays

and racism. "Its members are against
Reaganomic's, atomic power, and'all forms
of violence, ' said Shemaria.

David Easter, one of the 15 volunteers at

Peace Offerings, said “We want a peaceful .

foreign policy—one that does not support
dictatorial governments. ’ ’

What the store does, said Shemaria, is it
eliminates the middle broker, thereby at-
tempting to eliminate the exploitation of
workers.

One customer was looking speciﬁcally

for crafts from the West Bank,

Bangladesh, Gene and Israel, explaining
she wanted to buy something made out of
Jute, a ﬁber used in making rope. By buy-

ing Jute goods in Albany, she said, the
craftspcople of the Middle East will have
capital to continue their arts.

Another customer said that while she
has no particular political convictions, she
“just wants to help individuals to help
themselves.” El

preliminary injunction would be allow- ,.
ed. “The decision on the preliminary in-
junction will probably be indicative of
the trial,” said Oliver. "This is usually,

position on the issue."

“We are still waiting for the
preliminary injunction which would
stop enforcement of the law until the
courts have made a verdict on its con-
stitutionality," Oliver said.

Randall Tasnacht who is a landlord
being prosecuted by the city for viola-
tion of the Grouper Law refused to
comment in accordance with his at-
torney's advice."

Financial aid eyed

In an attempt to streamline the ﬁnan-
cial aid system in higher education,
Walter H. Moulton, director of student
aid at Bowdoin College, said the federal
government would save Sl9l million a
year by eliminating the National Direct
Student Loan Program while helping
students consolidate their loan process-
ing and payments.

He proposed that all federally sup-
ported loans be made under a revamped
Guaranteed Student Loan Program that
would be administered by the colleges
and universities. “It is time for the
NDSL program to gracefully bow out,”
Mr. Moulton said. "We need one loan
program, with one set of limits and one
set of repayment terms."

Mr. Moulton said that by streamlin-
ing the loan programs, defaults might
decrease because of simpliﬁed repay-
ment schedules. “Some students wind
up with loans from three or four institu-
tions, all with different repayment
conditions--somc of them contradic-
tory," he said.

Mr. Moulton proposed an increase in
the “2,500 OSL total borrowing limit
to “7,500, with annual loan limits In«
creating with each year of education.
Loan limits would start at $2,500 for
freshmen, rise to $3,000 for sophomores
and reach a maximum of $4,000 in the
third, fourth and fifth years.
