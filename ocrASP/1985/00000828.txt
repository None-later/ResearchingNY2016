Testvanxiety not necessarily

By Elinor Brook _
From sweaty palms to
stomachachcs, most of us have
experienced some form of test
anxiety.
Many students experience
dreams in which they had to take

a ﬁnal exam in a course they

never attended, -

or they were 

unable to ﬁnd

the room to 

which they were

supposed to 

report. This experience is far

from uncommon, especially with

ﬁnals week rapidly approaching.
While a certain amount of anx-

iety is inevitable. there are

strategies you can use to effectivc- '

Iy improve your test-taking and to
reduce the amount of stress you
experience during exam time.

. The term ‘test anxiety' encom-
passes several factors. We are all
familiar with the various physical
reactions to stress, such as
shakiness or rapid heartratc.
Negative thinking will also often
accompany anxiety-fraught test
situations. Some examples of
such thinking might be “i know
I’m going to fail" or “There's no
way I can learn everything in
time."

Test anxiety may further
manifest itself in your behavior
concerning preparation and the
actual test-taking. Many students
find themselves often being late
for exams, or avoid preparing for
the exam because they feel there is
too much to cover. it is important
to be aware of this behavior in
order.to tryand, overcome it.

These aspects of test anxiety
can result in undue stress and are
likely to affect your grades.

For those of you who have ex-
perienced any or all of dthese
symptoms. ' it is possible to
alleviate this'vstrcss and improve
your test performance. it is im-
portant to identify the feelings
and behaviors that are interfering
with successful test taking to
begin to‘ manage these deterrents.

The bodily reactions to stress
are probably best managed by a
physical type of strategy. Relaxa-
tion training has been found to be
extremely helpful in alleviating
tension in various pans of the
body. Through such a process.
you can become familiar with the

v insurmountable at finals time

speciﬁc areas in your body that
tend to bear the brunt of the
stress you experience during a test
situation.

it is important to be aware of
what your are thinking about
yourself prior to and during the
the test. Be honest with yourself
about your successes and failures.
Ask yourScIf' if you really are do-
ing poorly in comparison to
everyone else. if you aren’t, you
may be imposing more stress on
yourself than is necessary or
helpful. If .you do find that you
are not on par with many other
students, using these techniques
can be especially valuable.

Try to keep in mind that one
exam is not a measure of your
value as a person. Don’t fall into
the trap of measuring It is im-
portant to be aware of what your
are thinking about yourself prior
to and during the the test. Be
honest with yourself about your
successes and failures. Ask
yourself if you really are doing
poorly in comparison to everyone
else. if you aren’t. you may be
imposing more stress on yourself
than is necessary or helpful. if
you do ﬁnd that you are not on
par with many other students. us-
ing these techniques can be
especially valuable.

Try to keep in mind that one
exam is not a measure of your
value‘as a person. Don’t fall into
the‘trap of measuring your self-
worth in terms of your test
performance. ‘

it is helpful to be aware of what
you are saying'to yourself during
the test.‘ When you find yourself
putting yourself down, ‘pcrh'aps
saying something like “"This is
ridiculous, there’s no way I can
pass this exam," try to counter
these thoughts with positive ones,
such as 1 studied hard for this. i
can do well." Remember that
your negative thoughts or self-
statcments can prove to be an
obstacle to successful test
performance.

Your behavior in an anxious
situation will also influence your
performance a great deal.
Avoidance is a common response
to anxiety and is a dangerous
practice because it u'sually com-
pounds the problem.
