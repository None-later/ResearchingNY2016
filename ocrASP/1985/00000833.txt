Men’s 1 985- "86 SUNYAC {PreView

By Mike MacAdam
ASSOCIATE SPOR TS EDITOR

This year's version of the Potsdam
Bears will look a lot like the team that
spent most of last season nestled in the
nation's number one spot in Division
iii. With nine returning letterrnen. in-
cluding four starters. Head Coach Jerry
Welsh enjoys the advantage of an
established nucleus with which to pur-
sue the conference title.

Last year, Potsdam was knocked out
of the top position in a fiercely played
65-57 loss to Albany State. punctuated
by a bench-clearing melee. and the tone
of that game may have been an indica-
tion of things to come for this season.
The Danes look to be the top challenger
for Potsdam's quest for SUNYAC East
' dominance. but it won't be easy for an
Albany team fielding only one retum-
ing starter. last year’s leading scorer.
Adam Ursprung, now a junior.

Binghamton should take third. with
their stiffest challenge coming from
Cortland.

The question marks abound in the
Oneonta and Plattsburgh programs.

and these teams will be stepping on ‘

each other trying to stay out: of the base-
ment. The only team that might get in
the way is New Paltz. rookies to the
conference.

Plattsburgh is rebuilding. with seven
new players in Cardinal red. and
Oneonta coach Don Flewelling. who
will be temporarily replaced by Mark
Woitach.

The entire SUNYAC conference will
have a new look this year. Last year the
conference implemented a 45 second
clock; this year each gym will have a
20-foot three point arc painted. The
circles should make things interesting
and will definitely have an impact.
Potsdam: Welsh is sitting in the catbird
seat with nine returnees. Potsdam
spent a sizable chunk of last season on
top of theyDivision Iii world. and this
could be th‘e year that they stay there.

The Bears lost starter Ed Okwniewski
to graduation. but they have loads of
experience. and star point guard
Roosevelt Bullock returns for his final
season.

Returning Lettermen: The four
starters are enough to make opposing
coaches shudder. but there are also
enough returnees on the bench to form
a separate team by themselves.

Bullock epitomizes the quick
playmaking guard and will be the Bears
quarterback on the court.

The Bears' twin towers. 6'5" junior
Brendon Mitchell and 6'5" Senior John
Leonard. will be rebounding machines
for Potsdam. but Mitchell will con-
tribute on the scoreboard after leading
the Bears in that department last year.

Senior shooting guard 'i‘roy Turner
will be the Potsdam player most likely
to take advantage of the new three-
point stripe.

Off the bench the Bea rs will be depen-
ding on Brooklyn native Barry Stanton.
a junior, for rebounding as well as
points. and Welch will also have
Shaker High product Tom Conboy.
another senior, at guard.

Players lost: Potsdam will sorely miss
the services of two 6'5" center-
forwards. Okuniewski and Rick
Whitney. who provided strength and
scoring inside. .

Strengths: Experience with a capital E.
The word 'veteran' has an easy time
finding its way into a conversation with
Welsh. and it's hard to put a price tag
on the savv nine returnees. all of

which are either juniors or seniors. br-
ing onto the court with them.

Potsdam seems to have put it
altogether. and the losses of Whimey
and Okuniewski to graduation may be
the only chink in their armor. The Bears
still have overpowering rebounders in
Mitchell. Leonard and Stanton, and
Bullock‘s passing and drives down the
lane will set the tempo for an offense
that won’t have trouble scoring.

Potsdam plays well at the other end
of the court also. and Welsh has the ad-
vantage of an experienced bench that
will allow him to keep fresh bodies out
there at all times.

Weaknesses: None in sight. according
to Welsh. "We can't tell yet; talk to me
at midseason." said Welsh. His answer
at midseason may very well be. “We
can't tell yet: talk to me during the
SUNYAC championship."

Expectations.- Only divine interven-
tion will keep the Bears from leading
the pack.

Prediction: First

Binghamton: Head Coach Dave Ar-
cher's third season at Binghamton‘s
helm shoudn't look much different
from his first two. The rabbits will be
out of their cages when the Colonials
take the court. and their fast break may
just put them in the playoffs this year.

The starting line-up was dealt a
serious blow though. by the graduation
of three key individuals. 6'6" center
Marty Young. guard Greg Fleming and
forward Derek Harrison.

Two new faces are Broome Com-
munity College transfers Dean Mat-
thews and Monte Lamort.

5'11' junior guard Barry Goldberg will
come off the bench for Archer.

Players lost: Binghamton will lose some
valuable boardwork without Young
and Harrison. but there will still be
plenty of quickness. despite Fleming’s
departure.

The Colonials will also miss the
defensive prowess of graduating
Maurice Salama.

Strengths: Binghamton has great
quickness and can move the ball up-
court in the blink of an eye. They are
deep at guard. Dummler can also play
at that position. and their outside I
shooting is heavily relied upon.

Binghamton may be able to exploit
the new three-point circle better than
any other SUNYAC East team.
Weaknesses: Binghamton will have a
size advantage against most of the
teams they face because of lack of
depth of big men.

Expectations: Archer's staff feels they
have a legitimate shot at a playoff spot.
which they do.

But the loss of Young and Harrison
will hurt their rebounding. and they
must now rely on Schuman as their big
man.

Prediction — Third

Cortland: The Red Dragons resemble
Binghamton in that they have good
quickness but lack overall size. Their
fast break Is not up to par with
Binghamtons. however. and the lost a
key player in power fowar Mike‘
Stokes.

Returning Letterman — 5‘11
sophomore guard Al Scott will return as
the Dragons' playmaker. He ,.will be
joined outside by 6'2 Dave Goodrich
and 6'2,Harry Barry. who will share
time at the other guard spot. .

6'3 forward Mark Winescoop will
pick u the slack on the boards as well
as ad scoring punch. .

Players lost: The hole left by Stokes.
the Dragons most profilicscorer, will
not be ﬁlled easily. » -

Strengths: Cortland is ﬂeet of foot as a
whole «and will be. able-to run with
most other teams.

Scott-continues to develop-as a team
leader. -.

Weaknesses: The lack of size will give
head coach Bill Williams many a
headache trying to figure who's going
to rebound. especially with the loss of
Stokes. . . . '

They may be able to run with other
teams. but the Dragons, will be hard-

,' pressed to fuel their fast break without

defensive rebounds.

Expectations: Cortland will play in-
consistently early on. buf Williams feels
arshot at the playoffs is not out of the
question. . . ._

Prediction — Fourth I

Oneontar Detailed information not
available.
Prediction — Fifth

Plattsburgh: Head Coach Norm Law
sees this as a building year for the Red
Dragons. A combinationof youth and
the fact that the team sports sevennew
players pose a multitude of questions
for Law. who hopes he can find some
answers before too long. .

Returning lettennan: Key starters for
Plattsburgh will be 5'10" guard Tony
Cedric and 6‘5" forwards Mark Mcin-
tyre and Bernard Brown. McIntyre and
Brown will have to carry the brunt of
the scoring loads 1

Players lost.- The most significant
losses to graduation were Steve Dowd
and Law's son. Jeff. -

Strengths: The playmaking of Cedric
and the experience of McIntyre and
Brown will be essential to the develop-
ment of the new players.

Weaknesses: inexperience is the most
glaring problem. and the large quantity
of new personnel will take some time
to learn to play together and work as a
unit.

Expectations: Law hopes that forward
Marty Safford. one of the new players.
will blossom into a scoring threat. it re-
mains to be seen whether .senior
shooting guard Joe Wright. who missed
all of last season with a knee injury.
will respond positively to treatment.

"I think it will take us awhile to play
consistently." said Law. “Hopefully
we‘ll be coming around by January."

inexperienced is thejadjectlve that
best describes the majority of teams in
the women's SUNYAC East division
this season. With most teams having
lost substantial portions of their star-
ting line-ups from last year. enthusiasm
and raw talent are' the assets most
coaches are claiming as their strengths.

With four retitrnin‘g'starters. including

' senior Rainny Lesane. the first woman

ever to total 1000 c'arEer points at
Albany. the Danes should repeat as
conference champions. despite the loss
of Ronnie Patterson. Cordand."which
ﬁnished second last year. also retained
much of their starting line-up. and one
year of additional - experience could
possibly help to overtake Albany. ‘ ’

Plattsburgh ﬁnished second from the
bottom last season. but they have three
ramming starters and picked up several
all-conference freshmen. Binghamton
went one better and obtained. much to
the delight of the team. a new coach.

Oneonta followed suit. but the team
didn't stop at getting a new coach —
they also got a‘ new team. albeit a*
shorter one. which .will place them
lower than their third place position of
last season. They will most likely ﬁnish
below Oswego. which has all-
conference senior center Linda DeRyhe
returning. after a season off due to an
ankle injury.

Potsdam, which finished last. should
do so again this year, as they are
fielding a team dominated by
freshmen. ' '

Predictions
1) Albany State

2) Cortland State: Detailed informa-
tion unavailable.

3)Plattsburgh State: The Cardinals
finished second from the bottom last
season. but they return three starters.

Denise Slimard and forward Darcie

Phoebe Stum’picked up 5'11" center

both from Elizabethtown and who. ac-
cording to Stum have won every high
school honor possible. Sturn is also
looking at freshman Kim Nystrom and
sophomore transfer Belinda Cross to
add depth at the forward position.
Strengths: With more than half of their
starters returning. Plattsburgh boasts
more experience than the majority of
teams in the SUNYAC East. The players
replacing the '85 graduates all boast
either experience or honors.

Weaknesses: The team only finished
second from the bottom last season.
and with half a team returning. they
could repeat this performance.

Strengths: Binghamton boasts ex-

perienced guards. and has height at the

center in 6' freshman Rosemary Gure.
Weaknesses: All of Coates' forwards.
Marianne Boulcher, April Bright and
Kate Fox. are inexperienced. Although
the Colonials are enthused to have a
new coach. his inability to remember
his team‘s record last year shows his
competence.

4) Binghamton: The Colonials' new
coach. E. Leon Coates. isn't too sure
where his team finished last season or
what their record was. One thing he
does know. however. is that the only
experience on his team lies with guards
Jane Peverti. a senior. and sophomore
Danielle Reynolds. According to
Coates. enthusiasm and youthfulness
are his team's strengths. and he will be

who broke the_1000 career point total
as a junior. The remaining players

can best be described as pieces to a
puzzle. When the pieces fit right, you
can see the clear picture — a 22-4
record. in 1984-85. Koselak fit in
perfectly last year.

"She's very team-oriented." said
Salonburo. "She gets tremendous

respect from the players. She is very ~

considerate of the players."

Koselak readily admits. Her eight

could have been a lot higher if

tendinitis. _

The heavy bandages are off for now.
but Ursprung says it will probably come
back at some point of this season. He
also missed several games last year due
to a calcium deposit in his left thigh.
When Ursprung returned to the line-up.
his leg looked more like a thoroughbred
horse's leg before a race.

And Ursprung played like an animal
after his return. playing a large role in
helping Sauers get his 500th victory.

"At the beginning of the year. all the
players wanted to o it." said Ursprung.
"No one thought 2t wins was impossi-
ble. When we finally did do It. it was a

great feeling."

The only win that topped Sauers'
500th victory in Ursprung's mind was
the win at home against Potsdam State.

"i’ll never forget that practice before
the game." said Ursprung. "Jan came
out with a t-shirt that said “Potsdam
sucks'."

Two other fond memories he has of
last season were the two dunks he had.
But with a 341/1" vertical jump. you
would expect Ursprung to have more.

"This year l'm getting up better," said
Ursprung. "Last year. Doc got a little
mad at me because i missed a dunk
when i tried to do a 270° or something.

"We're doing a lot of alley-oops this
year." said Ursprung. "if i'm not in traf-
fic. i'll dunk It. I'll probably get a few

with DeR ke back at center and two ex-
perience forwards. Oswego should
better their last season's record.
Strengths: Before DeRyke's injury.
Oswego had a commendable 8-4 record
and looked like a contender for the East
title. Oswego is also experienced at for-
ward. with sophomore Karen Hain and
senior Kathy Baumberger returning.
Weaknesses: Oswego has no experienc-

Koselak wasn‘t so unselfish. "l'm a
good team player." Koselak said.
"but i think l'm passing too often. if
the pass is there. l’m definitely going
to give it."

Warner and teammates have made
Kosalek aware of her tendency to
forgo the shot and try instead to hit
an open player. "She's a nice
shooter." Warner said. "She has a
fine touch on the ball. She needs to
take it more."

in the SUNYAC finals last year
against Buffalo State. the Danes suc-
cumbed to the Bengals' brutal tactics
in a bloodbath of a basketball game.
Albany was physically overrnatched
by a rougher and tougher Buffalo
squad. That haunting memory lives
on in the minds of all the players in-
cluding Koselak. "That game was out
of control." Kosalek said. "it was a
streetbrawl."

The Danes lost the streetbrawl and

ed guards. and has already
demonstrated their inability to com-
pensate for the loss of any key player.
Their look of depth will keep them
from contention.

6) Oneonta: The Red Dragons ﬁnished
third in the SUNYAC East last season.
however. this is a completely different
team. with no starters returning. in-
cluding the coach. However the present
coach. Barbara Blodgett. was named co-
coach of the year for the '83-'84 season.
when Oneonta took second in the
SUNYAC playoH tournament. losing by
one point to Buffalo State. Blodgett
boasts that her team has a lot of talent
and is looking to get back up to the top
of the conference.

Strengths: Blodgett's coaching will be a
definite asset to the team. as her ten
years of coaching experience should
enable her to get. the most out of her
young team. Oneonta's most experienc-
ed positions are at center and forward.
at which they have three returning
players.

Weaknesses: With no returning
starters. Oneonta will have no leader-
ship on the court. it‘s too bad Blodgett
can‘t play.

7) Potsdam: Not only is this a
rebuilding year for Potsdam. in the
words of head coach Adelene
Malatesta. "it‘s deﬁnitely a rebuilding
year." The team has two ramming
starters. 5'6" junior guard Laurie Clarke.
and 5'8" sophomore forward Judy
Heller. Other than Clarke. every player
is either a freshman or sophomore.
making this a none-or-one team in
terms of experience.

Strengths.- Potsdam looks strongest at
the guard position. where besides hav-
ing Clarke. they have freshman Val
Cavanaugh and Mary Michailak. both
of whom Malatesta feels have enor-
mous potential.

Weaknesses: Potsdam lacks an ex-
perienced center and did little during
the off-season to fill this void. Addi-
tionally. with no wins in the SUNYAC
conference last season. the team can't
help but suffer from a lack of con-
fidence.

will need help this year from Koselak
in that department.

Koselak. at 5'10". had some success
rebounding last season. but she feels
an improvement is needed. "1 have
to think ahead." said Koselak. _
“When the shot goes up. i have to an-
ticipate and immediately go into
position."

Warner offered more advice. "She
boxes out well. but she needs to go
after the ball more aggressively."

Koselak takes criticism well,
especially when it comes from
Warner. "She knows what she's talk-
ing about." the junior foward said.
"In ’high school i valued male
coaches' advice more and worked for
them better. Since i left high school.
Coach Warner has chaiiged my
perception on female coaches."

When Koselak left high school. she
thought she'd never be part of a
basketball team again. Now. Koselak
Is setting some mighty high goals for
herself and her team. "We'd like to
qualify for the NCAAs." she said.
"and we'd like to meet Buffalo
State." ['3
